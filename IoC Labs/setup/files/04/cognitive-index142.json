At present, viral diagnostics are based on direct detection of viral components or indirect detection by measuring antibodies generated in response to viral infection. While sensitivity of detection and quantification are still important challenges, we expect major advances from new assay formats and synthetic binding molecules, such as aptamers. Compared to traditional antibody-based detection, aptamers could provide faster adaptation to continuously evolving virus strains and higher discriminating capacity between specific virus serotypes. Aptamers are very stable and easily modifiable, so are ideal molecules for detection and chemical sensing applications. Here, we review the use of aptasensors for detection of viral pathogens and consider the feasibility of aptasensors to become standard devices for point-of-care diagnostics of viruses.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Kieboom, Corn\u00E9 H.; van der Beek, Samantha L.; M\u00E9sz\u00E1ros, Tam\u00E1s; Gyurcs\u00E1nyi, R\u00F3bert E.; Ferwerda, Gerben; de Jonge, Marien I.","journal":"TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d44df76bea55d5b791f6fdacf188ddc72b19eb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112930.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165993615002435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2015.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993615002435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287539/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of viral pathogens","sensitivity of detection","indirect detection","viral diagnostics","direct detection of viral components","viral infection","aptamers","traditional antibody-based detection","use of aptasensors","Abstract Novel viral diagnostic tools","ideal molecules","feasibility of aptasensors","evolving virus strains","synthetic binding molecules","specific virus serotypes","care diagnostics of viruses","higher discriminating capacity","new assay formats","major advances","faster adaptation","antibodies","specificity equivalent","point","important challenges","chemical sensing applications","standard devices","current standards","quantification","response","present"],"language":"en"},

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses circulating in a region of Northern Italy, Lombardia, during the influenza season of 2015\u20132016. METHODS: Influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays and an influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. The complete influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: A total of 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the great majority of influenza B strains (66/71, 93.0%) belonged to the Victoria-lineage and were antigenically like vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) included only in the quadrivalent vaccine. In the detected influenza B strains, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the antigenic regions: I117V, V124A, N129D, V146I, N197D, T199A, and A202T. However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in the HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All the influenza B strains identified in this study belonged to the influenza B Victoria lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly used by the general population during the 2015\u20132016 influenza season in Italy. This indicates that protection against influenza B infection in the vaccinated population was in general very poor during the 2015\u20132016 influenza season.","publish_time":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piralla, Antonio; Lunghi, Giovanna; Ruggiero, Luca; Girello, Alessia; Bianchini, Sonia; Rovida, Francesca; Caimmi, Silvia; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Principi, Nicola; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c2f3b308f203b56e322c637bd1eec3e228fa524.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5648122.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza B positive","influenza B infection","influenza B Victoria lineage","influenza season","detected influenza B strains","complete influenza B hemagglutinin","great majority of influenza B strains","molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses","influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction","Victoria lineages","Victoria-lineage","study","HA regions","antigenic regions","antigenic characteristics","general population","Yamagata","trivalent vaccine","vaccine strain","Phylogenetic analysis","quadrivalent vaccine","series of amino acid changes","vaccinated population","region of Northern Italy","respiratory virus panel of assays","hospitalized pediatric patients","N129D","V124A","N197D","V146I","receptor binding","I117V","Lombardia","original isolates","T199A","total","antibody recognition","nucleotide sequences","Brisbane","protection","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","A202T","RESULTS","primary aim","clinical specimens"],"language":"en"},

Vaccine development, vaccine immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy have, for the most part, historically been driven by an empiric \u201Cisolate-inactivate-inject\u201D paradigm. In turn, a population-level public health paradigm of \u201Cthe same dose for everyone for every disease\u201D model has been the normative thinking in regard to prevention of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. In addition, up until recently, no vaccines specifically had been designed to overcome the immunosenescence of aging, consistent with a post-WWII mentality of developing vaccines and vaccine programs for children. It is now recognized that the current lack of knowledge concerning how immune responses to vaccines are generated is a critical barrier to understanding poor vaccine responses in the elderly and in immunoimmaturity, discovery of new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity (vaccine response biomarkers), and a directed approach to new vaccine development. The new fields of vaccinomics and adversomics provide models that permit global profiling of the innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses integrated at a systems biology level. This has advanced the science beyond that of reductionist scientific approaches by revealing novel interactions between and within the immune system and other biological systems (beyond transcriptional level), which are critical to developing \u201Cdownstream\u201D adaptive humoral and cellular responses to infectious pathogens and vaccines. Others have applied systems level approaches to the study of antibody responses (a.k.a. \u201Csystems serology\u201D), [1] high dimensional cell subset immunophenotyping through CyTOF, [2, 3] and vaccine induced metabolic changes [4]. In turn, this knowledge is being utilized to better understand the following: identifying who is at risk for which infections; the level of risk that exists regarding poor immunogenicity and/or serious adverse events; and the type or dose of vaccine needed to fully protect an individual. In toto, such approaches allow for a personalized approach to the practice of vaccinology, analogous to the substantial inroads that individualized medicine is playing in other fields of human health and medicine.

This work was undertaken to test the hypothesis that low molecular weight SB-AHGs (MW\u003C235 for the free SB) make better antiviral agents than high MW SB-AHGs (MW\u003E300). The plaque reduction assay method demonstrated that three compounds, I, VII and IX, had moderate activity against HSV-1, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 38.0, 23.5 and 52.1 \u03BCM, respectively. Against Ad 5, compounds I, VIII and XI exhibited moderate activity, with IC50 values of 52.7, 19.3 and 5.1 \u03BCM, respectively. Among the compounds screened, compound I (1-[(3\u2032-hydroxy-6\u2032-methyl-2\u2032-pyridyl)methylene]amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate) was the most promising antiviral candidate, with selectivity indices (SI) of 10.2 (HSV-1) and 7.6 (Ad 5), respectively. Virus yield reduction assays indicated that compound I had less antiviral potency against HSV-1 than against Ad 5. The antiviral effects of compound I at a high input virus multiplicity of infection (MOI\u003E5) indicated that compound I had effective anti-adenoviral activity at 24 h post infection. This work demonstrated that some of SB-AHGs only have moderate antiviral activities against Ad 5 and HSV-1 viruses. In general, low MW SB-AHGs have low cytotoxicities to the host cells.","publish_time":"1999-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Arima; Trousdale, Melvin D; Ren, Shijun; Lien, Eric J","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1567debc904937d07a2dfcfdb67743e2f3c8cd90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125830.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354299000704; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354299000704","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["XI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","HSV","low MW SB-AHGs","high MW SB-AHGs","compounds","antiviral effects of compound","free SB","antiviral potency","moderate activity","moderate antiviral activities","low molecular weight SB-AHGs","virus yield reduction assays","better antiviral agents","promising antiviral candidate","low cytotoxicities","high input virus multiplicity of infection","herpes simplex virus type","plaque reduction assay method","IC50 values","\u03BCM","work","effective anti-adenoviral activity","hydroxygu tosylate","adenovirus type","h post infection","heterocyclic Schiff bases of aminohydroxyguanidine tosylate","selectivity indices","hypothesis","MOI","host cells","pyridyl","methylene","inhibitory concentration","viruses"],"language":"en"},

However, these measures may interfere in the normal medical service. We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China. METHODS: Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. RESULTS: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926\u201367,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April. However, the huge unmet medical needs for other diseases could result in massive migration of patients and their families, bringing tremendous challenges for medical service in major metropolis and disease control for the potential asymptomatic virus carrier.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zeye; Huang, Shuai; Lu, Wenlong; Su, Zhanhao; Yin, Xin; Liang, Huiying; Zhang, Hao","journal":"Glob Health Res Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe72acc2584f86459acf0883c1bd47d78377bfa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200323.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00145-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China","Wuhan","Shanghai","Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["normal medical service","end of epidemic","medical centers","epidemic of Wuhan","Beijing","Shanghai","Guangzhou","additional medical professionals","huge unmet medical needs","epidemic period","China","restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service","Real-time data of COVID","disease control","trend of COVID","model disease trends","nonlocal hospitalization","outbreak of coronavirus disease","additional hospitalization","government","public transportation data","population mobility data","traffic control","number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations","number of infected people","unprecedented intervention measures","Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average","major metropolis","families","diseases","tremendous challenges","ARIMA","potential asymptomatic virus carrier","NNs","massive migration of patients","accumulated demands","neural network models","open sources","cumulative confirmed cases","RESULTS","deaths","METHODS","country","SEIR","CI","month","metropolises","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","middle","point"],"language":"en"},

However, as specific PCR only detects pre-defined targets, novel virus strains or viruses not included in routine test panels will be missed. Recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for virus-sequence-independent identification of entire virus populations in clinical samples, yet standardized protocols are needed to allow broad application in clinical diagnostics. Here, we describe a comprehensive sample preparation protocol for high-throughput metagenomic virus sequencing using random amplification of total nucleic acids from clinical samples. RESULTS: In order to optimize metagenomic sequencing for application in virus diagnostics, we tested different enrichment and amplification procedures on plasma samples spiked with RNA and DNA viruses. A protocol including filtration, nuclease digestion, and random amplification of RNA and DNA in separate reactions provided the best results, allowing reliable recovery of viral genomes and a good correlation of the relative number of sequencing reads with the virus input. We further validated our method by sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagent containing a range of human viruses from different virus families. Our method proved successful in detecting the majority of the included viruses with high read numbers and compared well to other protocols in the field validated against the same reference reagent. Our sequencing protocol does work not only with plasma but also with other clinical samples such as urine and throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The workflow for virus metagenomic sequencing that we established proved successful in detecting a variety of viruses in different clinical samples. Our protocol supplements existing virus-specific detection strategies providing opportunities to identify atypical and novel viruses commonly not accounted for in routine diagnostic panels.

A follow-up epidemiological investigation carried out on the initial and 10 subsequent Ontario PED cases pointed to feed as a common risk factor. As a result, several lots of feed and spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) used as a feed supplement were tested for the presence of PEDV genome by real-time RT-PCR assay. Several of these tested positive, supporting the notion that contaminated feed may have been responsible for the introduction of PEDV into Canada. These findings led us to conduct a bioassay experiment in which three PEDV-positive SDPP samples (from a single lot) and two PEDV-positive feed samples supplemented with this SDPP were used to orally inoculate 3-week-old piglets. Although the feed-inoculated piglets did not show any significant excretion of PEDV, the SDPP-inoculated piglets shed PEDV at a relatively high level for \u22659 days. Despite the fact that the tested PEDV genome positive feed did not result in obvious piglet infection in our bioassay experiment, contaminated feed cannot be ruled out as a likely source of this introduction in the field where many other variables may play a contributing role.","publish_time":"2014-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pasick, J; Berhane, Y; Ojkic, D; Maxie, G; Embury-Hyatt, C; Swekla, K; Handel, K; Fairles, J; Alexandersen, S","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9521353cc7ef3d0734d76453622762532f06f777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4282400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098383/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PEDV"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["PEDV-positive feed samples","contaminated feed","tested PEDV genome positive feed","introduction of PEDV","lots of feed","feed supplement","feed-inoculated piglets","PEDV-positive SDPP samples","presence of PEDV genome","significant excretion of PEDV","SDPP-inoculated piglets","bioassay experiment","case of PED","week-old piglets","result","subsequent Ontario PED cases","south-western Ontario","initial detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea","spray-dried porcine plasma","obvious piglet infection","real-time RT-PCR assay","single lot","swine herd","USA","high level","common risk factor","variables","field","months","notion","follow-up epidemiological investigation","likely source","contributing role","days","Canada","findings","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

The 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa, however, saw widespread and sustained criticism of its performance, leading many to call for its reform and even replacement. This article moves on from initial analyses of the WHO\u0027s \u2018failure\u2019, to argue that the crisis has led to a shift in its authority as a global governor. It argues that the WHO\u0027s traditional basis of authority was largely expert and delegated; that it provided technical advice and normative guidance, and that its authority was \u2018on loan\u2019 from member states, who exerted considerable influence over the WHO. Its actions during the West African Ebola outbreak remained consistent with this, but it was unable to cope with what the outbreak required. The criticisms both of the WHO and the wider system of global health governance, however, have opened up a space where the balance of authority is shifting to one based more heavily on capacity\u2014the ability to act in a crisis. If such a shift is realized, it will create different expectations of the WHO which, if they are not fulfilled, may lead to trust in the organisation declining and its legitimacy being compromised.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"McINNES, COLIN","journal":"Int Aff","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70e64c9b4d2bccc794f284dfea1c31ff0678b3d6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2346.12454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["West Africa","West African Ebola"],"keyphrases":["balance of authority","Ebola crisis","wider system of global health governance","global governor","WHO\u0027s traditional basis of authority","shift","West African Ebola outbreak","World Health Organization","key role","member states","technical advice","control of epidemics","initial analyses","normative guidance","actions","central place","considerable influence","sustained criticism","performance","failure","loan","organisation","pandemics","article","ability","space","reform","replacement","different expectations","trust","legitimacy","capacity","criticisms"],"language":"en"},

These are: firstly, in diagnosis, to recognise the causative agent of an illness; secondly, for molecular typing for (i) patient management, (ii) epidemiological reasons (e.g. investigating routes of transmission), (iii) purposes related to vaccine use; and thirdly, in research, to investigate the interactions between the virus and the host cell. Microarrays intended for syndromic diagnostic purposes require genome specific probes to capture the unknown target viral sequences and thereby reveal the presence of that virus in a test sample. Microarrays intended for typing and patient management, e.g. monitoring antiviral drug resistant mutations require a set of probes representing the important sequence variants of one or more viral genes. Microarrays intended for research into virus\u2013host interactions require probes representative of each individual gene or mRNA of either the virus or the host genome.

The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters\u0027 Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking and biomass fuel use acted as major contributors to the high occurrence of COPD in China. Management of COPD in China should focus on adjusting the distribution of medical resources and on addressing public health policies to facilitate earlier diagnosis in rural areas, aim to reduce smoking prevalence, improve patients\u0027 self-management, and keep physicians\u0027 knowledge up to date and consistent with current guidelines. COPD is one of the most challenging medical issues facing China because of its influence on both personal and public health and its impact on the economy. Optimal management strategies should be adopted and strengthened immediately.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Xiaocong; Wang, Xiangdong; Bai, Chunxue","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79c4b114ab9f9e8070911e38d090446dc700453f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125604.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369211601955; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369211601955; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.10-1393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21467059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Thomson Reuters"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","Management of COPD","COPD prevalence","disease burden of COPD","high occurrence of COPD","previous studies of COPD","smoking prevalence","effective management","high prevalence of smoking","rural areas","public health policies","patients\u0027 self-management","Optimal management strategies","increasing public health concern","urban areas","government Web sites","related Web sites","Chinese medical community","Thomson Reuters\u0027 Web of Knowledge","physicians\u0027 knowledge","evidence","aim","major Chinese databases","distribution of medical resources","challenging medical issues","major contributors","earlier diagnosis","credible review","biomass fuel use","PubMed","ProQuest","mortality","risk factors","influence","date","leading cause of death","impact","current guidelines","different provinces","cities","hospital admissions","year","article","economy","purpose","addition"],"language":"en"},

The ectodomain of the S glycoprotein is localized on the surface of CHO-SG cells with N-acetyl-glucosamine-terminated carbohydrate structure. CHO-SG cells associated tightly with Vero E6 cells, a SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) expressing cell-line, and the interaction remained stable under highly stringent condition (1M NaCl). This interaction could be blocked by either the serum from a SARS convalescent patient or a goat anti-ACE2 antibody, indicating that the interaction is specific. A binding epitope with lesser degree of glycosylation and native conformation was localized by using rabbit anti-sera raised against five denatured recombinant S protein fragments expressed in Escherichia coli. One of the sera obtained from the fragment encompassing amino acids 48-358 significantly blocked the interaction between CHO-SG and Vero E6 cells.

The study of glial derived factors induced by injury is important to understand the processes that allow or preclude regeneration, and can explain why the PNS has a remarkable ability to regenerate, while the CNS does not. In this work we focus on Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), a Lipocalin expressed by glial cells in the PNS and CNS. ApoD expression is strongly induced upon PNS injury, but its role has not been elucidated. Here we show that ApoD is required for: (1) the maintenance of peripheral nerve function and tissue homeostasis with age, and (2) an adequate and timely response to injury. We study crushed sciatic nerves at two ages using ApoD knock\u2010out and transgenic mice over\u2010expressing human ApoD. The lack of ApoD decreases motor nerve conduction velocity and the thickness of myelin sheath in intact nerves. Following injury, we analyze the functional recovery, the cellular processes, and the protein and mRNA expression profiles of a group of injury\u2010induced genes. ApoD helps to recover locomotor function after injury, promoting myelin clearance, and regulating the extent of angiogenesis and the number of macrophages recruited to the injury site. Axon regeneration and remyelination are delayed without ApoD and stimulated by excess ApoD. The mRNA and protein expression profiles reveal that ApoD is functionally connected in an age\u2010dependent manner to specific molecular programs triggered by injury. \u00A9 2010 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2010-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganfornina, Maria D.; Do Carmo, Sonia; Mart\u00EDnez, Eva; Tolivia, Jorge; Navarro, Ana; Rassart, Eric; Sanchez, Diego","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a2e1781be0d5dca1dcd9f27a51737914c2589de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.21010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20607718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PNS","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ApoD expression","ApoD knock","PNS injury","human ApoD","lack of ApoD","excess ApoD","group of injury","injury site","Glial cells","protein expression profiles","mRNA expression profiles","process of axonal regeneration","Axon regeneration","CNS","induced genes","study of glial derived factors","maintenance of peripheral nerve function","myelin clearance","locomotor function","intact nerves","cellular processes","axonal growth","thickness of myelin sheath","crushed sciatic nerves","motor nerve conduction velocity","specific molecular programs","transgenic mice over\u2010","tissue homeostasis","key element","dependent manner","number of macrophages","functional recovery","Lipocalin","extent of angiogenesis","Apolipoprotein D","timely response","remyelination","remarkable ability","work","role","Wiley","Liss"],"language":"en"},

Tourism is crucial for the economies of Spain and China, and both countries have the longest high speed rail (HSR) networks in the world. What role has HSR infrastructure played in the development of tourism in both countries? Little research has been done to date, even in Europe, to estimate empirically how tourism indicators are affected by new HSR lines. In 2012 a multivariate panel analysis by Chen and Haynes was applied to 27 Chinese regions, and confirmed that emerging high speed rail services (during the period 1999\u20132010) had significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. No similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyse and validate this tool when applied to the Spanish context, and to develop a comparative analysis with the Chinese case study. The methodology is applied to 47 Spanish provinces during the period 1999\u20132015, and the results clearly reveal a positive but lower-value link (compared to China) between the increase in certain tourism outputs (foreign arrivals and revenues) and HSR network construction. However, further research is needed into the model\u0027s limitations, namely the availability of suitable tourism indicators in the official databases, the HSR explanatory variables considered, and the ability to detect \u201Ccircular cause-effects\u201D between HSR and tourism.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campa, Juan Luis; L\u00F3pez-Lambas, Mar\u00EDa Eugenia; Guirao, Bego\u00F1a","journal":"Journal of Transport Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/498c5814ddb98bb877b80e1b0ba51015f4fcb270.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288374/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669231630237X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.09.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096669231630237X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chen"],"organizations":["HSR"],"locations":["France","Spain","China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["development of tourism","HSR infrastructure","certain tourism outputs","availability of suitable tourism indicators","HSR explanatory variables","HSR network construction","new HSR lines","Abstract China","countries","period","Europe","longest high speed rail","world ranking of tourist arrivals","emerging high speed rail services","foreign arrivals","comparative analysis","Chinese regions","economies of Spain","Spanish provinces","Spanish context","tourist destinations","Little research","multivariate panel analysis","significant positive impacts","Chinese case study","similar empirical tool","revenues","official databases","Haynes","increase","networks","Chen","France","lower-value link","circular cause-effects","model\u0027s limitations","place","date","methodology","results","role","aim","paper"],"language":"en"},

As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors. In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. The basic reproduction number (R(0)), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection (\u2018totally na\u00EFve\u2019), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve.

A rapid, specific and sensitive detection method is always needed to control the influenza in its early stages by timely intervention of therapy and early clinical management. Objectives To develop RT-LAMP assays for detection of influenza A viruses, their further subtyping into seasonal (H1N1, H3N2) and novel pandemic H1N1 viruses and to evaluate clinical applicability of optimized RT-LAMP assays on patients\u2019 samples. Study design In this study, we optimized RT-LAMP assay to detect IAVs by using primers against matrix gene and subtyping of IAVs was done by using primers against hemagglutinin gene. Optimized RT-LAMP assays were applied on clinical samples from patients having influenza like illness and results were compared with conventional one-step RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Results RT-LAMP assays successfully detected and differentiated IAVs into H1N1, H3N2 and pdm09/H1N1 subtypes. One hundred and sixty seven clinical swab samples from influenza suspected patients were taken and tested with RT-LAMP assay, detecting 30 (17.9%) samples positive for Influenza A virus. Out of 30 samples, 21, 7 and 2 were found positive for pdm09/H1N1, H3N2 and seasonal H1 respectively. Conventional one-step RT-PCR detected a total of 27 (16.2%) samples for influenza A and further subtyping showed 20 and 7 samples positive for pdm09/H1N1 and H3N2 virus respectively whereas none was found positive for seasonal H1N1. RT-LAMP assay demonstrated higher sensitivity (93.8%) than conventional RT-PCR (84.4%) for influenza A viruses detection in clinical samples. Conclusions RT-LAMP assay is rapid, sensitive, specific and cost effective method for detection of influenza A viruses than conventional one-step RT-PCR and it can serve as a good alternate for diagnosis and surveillance studies during influenza outbreaks in resource-limited setups of developing countries.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Vikrant; Chaudhry, Dhruva; Kaushik, Samander","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa0f4cf2e43586e1638efd88627116ae7a9c2c18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253497/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417304111; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417304111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional RT-PCR","detection of influenza","Results RT-LAMP assays","Conclusions RT-LAMP assay","clinical samples","real-time RT-PCR","conventional one-step RT-PCR","samples positive","clinical applicability of optimized RT-LAMP assays","influenza outbreaks","seasonal H1N1","clinical swab samples","viruses detection","patients\u2019 samples","influenza suspected patients","Abstract Background Influenza","H1N1 subtypes","novel pandemic H1N1 viruses","H3N2 virus","pdm09","subtyping","early clinical management","sensitive detection method","differentiated IAVs","primers","early stages","effective method","matrix gene","hemagglutinin gene","Study design","surveillance studies","timely intervention of therapy","diagnosis","resource-limited setups of developing countries","global economy","illness","higher sensitivity","good alternate","serious concern","public health","total","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

A total of 123 open reading frames were predicted to encode functional proteins, ranging from 41 to 1,878 amino acid residues. The DNA sequence of AVNV is 97% identical to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), and the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins of these two viruses are 94-100% identical. The genomic organization of AVNV is similar to that of OsHV-1, and consists of two unique regions (170.4 kb and 3.4 kb, respectively), each flanked by two inverted repeats (7.6 kb and 10.2 kb, respectively), with a third unique region (1.5 kb) situated between the two internal repeats.

The lack of a licensed vaccine or treatment options emphasize the need to obtain more insight into the viral life cycle and CHIKV-host interactions. Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for such studies, and for mechanism of action studies on antiviral compounds. Existing CHIKV cDNA clones are based on a single genome from an individual clinical isolate, which is expected to have evolved specific characteristics in response to the host environment, and possibly also during subsequent cell culture passaging. To obtain a virus expected to have the general characteristics of the recent E1-226V CHIKV isolates, we have constructed a new CHIKV full-length cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the consensus sequence of their aligned genomes. Here we report the characterization of this synthetic virus and a green fluorescent protein-expressing variant (CHIKV LS3-GFP). Their characteristics were compared to those of natural strain ITA07-RA1, which was isolated during the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In cell culture the synthetic viruses displayed phenotypes comparable to the natural isolate, and in a mouse model they caused lethal infections that were indistinguishable from infections with a natural strain. Compared to ITA07-RA1 and clinical isolate NL10/152, the synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities to several antiviral compounds. 3-deaza-adenosine was identified as a new inhibitor of CHIKV replication. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CHIKV replication, suggesting that cyclophilins -opposite to what was found for other \u002BRNA viruses- do not play an essential role in CHIKV replication.

BCoV causing enteric and respiratory disease is widespread in cattle farms worldwide; however, limited information is available regarding the molecular characterization of BCoV because of its large genome size, despite its significant economic impact. This study aimed to better understand the genomic characterization and evolutionary dynamics of BCoV via comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses through whole genome sequence analysis using 67 BCoV isolates collected throughout Japan from 2006 to 2017. On comparing the genomic sequences of the 67 BCoVs, genetic variations were detected in 5 of 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in the BCoV genome. Phylogenetic analysis using whole genomes from the 67 Japanese BCoV isolates in addition to those from 16 reference BCoV strains, revealed the existence of two major genotypes (classical and US wild ruminant genotypes). All Japanese BCoV isolates originated from the US wild ruminant genotype, and they tended to form the same clusters based on the year and farm of collection, not the disease type. Phylogenetic trees on hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N) genes and ORF1 revealed clusters similar to that on whole genome, suggesting that the evolution of BCoVs may be closely associated with variations in these genes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of BCoV S genes including those of European and Asian BCoVs and human enteric coronavirus along with the Japanese BCoVs revealed that BCoVs differentiated into two major types (European and American types). Moreover, the European and American types were divided into eleven and three genotypes, respectively. Our analysis also demonstrated that BCoVs with different genotypes periodically emerged and predominantly circulated within the country. These findings provide useful information to elucidate the detailed molecular characterization of BCoVs, which have spread worldwide. Further genomic analyses of BCoV are essential to deepen the understanding of the evolution of this virus.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Tohru; Otake, Yoshihiro; Uchimoto, Satoko; Hasebe, Ayako; Goto, Yusuke","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c04cc69d2356b47970193404e51b3f3fc47322e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041103/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European and Asian BCoVs"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["BCoV genome","Japanese BCoV isolates","genomic analyses of BCoV","phylogenetic analysis of BCoV S genes","Japanese BCoVs","evolutionary dynamics of BCoV","reference BCoV strains","evolution of BCoVs","Asian BCoVs","genome sequence analysis","detailed molecular characterization of BCoVs","phylogenetic analyses","genomic characterization","major genotypes","US wild ruminant genotypes","Phylogenetic trees","major types","American types","different genotypes","large genome size","wild ruminants","genomic sequences","human enteric coronavirus","comparative sequence","nucleocapsid protein","limited information","respiratory disease","useful information","Bovine coronavirus","disease type","clusters similar","genetic variations","hemagglutinin-esterase protein","existence","cattle farms","spike glycoprotein","ORF1","ORFs","species","addition","genomes","significant economic impact","farm of collection","understanding","viruses","open reading frames","year","findings","humans","study","country"],"language":"en"},

By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. Methods The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with \u03B2-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1 and 2\u03BCg/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7, and the monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain. We assessed the safety of the SARS vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus. Findings The purity of SARS vaccine was 97.6% by HPLC identification and reacted with convalescent sera of SARS patients. The purified SARS vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV in monkeys. Under low levels of neutralizing antibody, no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV. In this preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified SARS vaccine either at normal or large doses. Interpretation The purified inactivated SARS vaccine could induce high levels of neutralizing antibody, and protect the monkeys from the challenge of SARS-CoV. The SARS vaccine prepared in the study appeared to be safe in monkeys.","publish_time":"2006-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Ede; Shi, Huiying; Tang, Lin; Wang, Cuie; Chang, Guohui; Ding, Zhifen; Zhao, Kai; Wang, Jian; Chen, Ze; Yu, Man; Si, Bingyin; Liu, Jianyuan; Wu, Donglai; Cheng, Xiaojie; Yang, Baoan; Peng, Wenming; Meng, Qingwen; Liu, Bohua; Han, Weiguo; Yin, Xunnan; Duan, Hongyuan; Zhan, Dawei; Tian, Long; Li, Shuangli; Wu, Jinsong; Tan, Gang; Li, Yi; Li, Yuchuan; Liu, Yonggang; Liu, Hong; Lv, Fushuang; Zhang, Yu; Kong, Xiangang; Fan, Baochang; Jiang, Tao; Xu, Shuli; Wang, Xiaomei; Li, Changwen; Wu, Xiaohong; Deng, Yongqiang; Zhao, Min; Zhu, Qingyu","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b9b1feeb8703388fc6b9b4d813f039f9d9a358d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115602.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X05008960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X05008960","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified SARS vaccine","purified inactivated SARS vaccine","purity of SARS vaccine","replication of SARS","challenge of SARS","SARS-CoV BJ","SARS-CoV GZ","inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine","unpurified vaccine","cultures of SARS coronavirus","immunized monkeys","convalescent sera of SARS patients","vaccinated monkeys","groups of rhesus monkeys","high levels of neutralizing antibody","low levels of neutralizing antibody","Antibody titers","high levels of neutralizing antibodies","antibody dependent enhancement","protective efficacy","strain infected Vero cells","different doses","large doses","HPLC identification","groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis","gel filtration","electron microscope","ultrafiltration","adjuvant","severe acute respiratory syndrome","ion exchange chromatography","ADE","exacerbation of clinical symptoms","plaque reduction neutralization test","Western blotting","effects","\u03BCg","study","Interpretation","Sequential procedures","Abstract Background","hundreds of infections","time","preliminary animal trial","\u03B2-propiolactone","Methods","immunogenicity","Findings","days","deaths","safety","control"],"language":"en"},

The identification of this IFN-inducing PRRSV isolate may be beneficial for vaccine development against PRRS.","publish_time":"2012-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nan, Yuchen; Wang, Rong; Shen, Meiyan; Faaberg, Kay S.; Samal, Siba K.; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dba47e99edf34300bd7253a1467b30aa8f8e4405.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111977.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682212002668; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212002668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704065/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A2MC2 infection of MARC","A2MC2 replication","PRRSV A2MC2 induced type","ability of IFN","synthesis of IFN","PAM cells","cultured cells","PRRSV isolate","proteins","IFNs","ISG56","A2MC2 infection of primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages","IFN-stimulated genes ISG15","transcript elevation","cytopathic effect","detectable inhibitory effect","Ingelvac PRRS MLV","PAMs","respiratory syndrome virus","\u03B12 protein","activator of transcription","vaccine development","identity","signal transducer","VR","STAT2","antiviral response","interferons","Sequencing analysis","identification","nucleotide level"],"language":"en"},

Controlling viral infections by disrupting viral entry is advantageous for antibody-mediated neutralization by the host\u2019s immune system and as a preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategy. Recently, several plant-derived carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) have emerged as a new class of antiviral biologics by taking advantage of a unique glycosylation pattern only found on the surface of viruses. In particular, a red algae-derived griffithsin (GRFT) protein has demonstrated superior in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity with minimum host toxicity against a variety of clinically relevant, enveloped viruses. This review examines the structural characteristics of GRFT, focusing on its carbohydrate-binding capability. Its in vitro antiviral profiles against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also discussed followed by a description of the results from a combination study using anti-HIV drugs. The results of several studies regarding its novel antiviral mechanism of action are provided in conjunction with an explanation of viral resistance profiles to GRFT. In addition, its in vitro and in vivo host toxicity profiles are summarized with its pharmacokinetic behavior using in vivo efficacy study results. Also, a large-scale production and formulation strategy, as well as a drug delivery strategy, for GRFT as a new class of broad-spectrum microbicides is discussed. Finally, results from two ongoing clinical studies examining GRFT\u2019s effects on viruses are presented.","publish_time":"2019-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Choongho","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fa76790be17b5874ff6402f20c43a89e5caaf43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6835697.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md17100567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral profiles","viral entry","antiviral activity","therapeutic antiviral strategy","host toxicity profiles","new class of antiviral biologics","viral infections","viral diseases","efficacy study results","explanation of viral resistance profiles","Virus entry","minimum host toxicity","structural characteristics of GRFT","novel antiviral mechanism of action","formulation strategy","surface of viruses","enveloped viruses","susceptible host cell","drug delivery strategy","carbohydrate-binding capability","plant-derived carbohydrate-binding proteins","combination study","new class of broad-spectrum microbicides","ongoing clinical studies","human immunodeficiency virus","anti-HIV drugs","red algae-derived griffithsin","antibody-mediated neutralization","advantage","variety","host\u2019s immune system","pharmacokinetic behavior","conjunction","GRFT\u2019s effects","step","lectins","unique glycosylation pattern","large-scale production","review","formation","description","addition"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of MERS-CoV [Virol J. 2014. 11:139]. Generally, amplification of RT-LAMP is monitored by the turbidity induced by precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate with newly synthesized DNA. However, this mechanism cannot completely exclude the possibility of unexpected reactions. Therefore, in this study, fluorescent RT-LAMP assays using quenching probes (QProbes) were developed specifically to monitor only primer-derived signals. Two primer sets (targeting nucleocapsid and ORF1a sequences) were constructed to confirm MERS cases by RT-LAMP assay only. Our data indicate that both primer sets were capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA to the same level as existing genetic diagnostic methods, and that both were highly specific with no cross-reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses. These primer sets were highly efficient in amplifying target sequences derived from different MERS-CoV strains, including camel MERS-CoV. In addition, the detection efficacy of QProbe RT-LAMP was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay using clinical specimens from patients in Saudi Arabia. Altogether, these results indicate that QProbe RT-LAMP assays described here can be used as powerful diagnostic tools for rapid detection and surveillance of MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shirato, Kazuya; Semba, Shohei; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Tolah, Ahmed M.; Takayama, Ikuyo; Kageyama, Tsutomu; Notomi, Tsugunori; Kamitani, Wataru; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/579c3e846a43cb0ce9b8b50a9bec93eee16ac4f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29763640/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418301058; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418301058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["detection of MERS","MERS-CoV RNA","camel MERS-CoV","amplification of RT","surveillance of MERS","MERS cases","QProbe RT-LAMP assays","fluorescent RT-LAMP assays","detection efficacy of QProbe RT-LAMP","different MERS-CoV strains","real-time RT-PCR assay","CoV infections","primer sets","rapid detection","primer-derived signals","patients","existing genetic diagnostic methods","Abstract Clinical detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome","powerful diagnostic tools","clinical specimens","ORF1a sequences","isothermal amplification","respiratory viruses","amplifying target sequences","level","coronavirus","quenching probes","precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate","reverse transcription-loop","Saudi Arabia","turbidity","QProbes","nucleocapsid","study","synthesized DNA","cross-reactivity","addition","results","Virol","possibility of unexpected reactions","data","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

This activity is conserved on the SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baron, Sophie Alexandra; Devaux, Christian; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Rolain, Jean-Marc","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87e8e2ff7b065fb4944e52cb8811492ed9c48c6e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a2d4f42c48161b18c14ebd3e9a844ecaac536680.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179150/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300947; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920300947; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["efficacy","Teicoplanin","SARS-CoV","new coronavirus","coronarivus viral cycle","need","stage of MERS","ribavirin","ritonavir","best tool","human cells","pneumonia outbreaks","specific treatments","drug repurposing","remdesivir","lopinavir","potential treatment","patients","lack of efficient","probable high transmission efficiency","Wuhan region","therapeutic solution","epidemic","Chloroquine","antibiotic","staphylococci infection","China","activity"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Fifty\u2010seven cases of infection by H1N1 were confirmed by RT\u2010PCR and enrolled. Of these 57 cases, 26 had a severe H1N1 infection (group 1), and 31 had a mild H1N1 infection (group 2). Sera from 18 cases with pneumonia without H1N1 infection (group 3) were used as controls. The serum levels of 10 cytokines were determined by multiplex assay. RESULTS: The serum levels of IFN\u2010\u03B1, IL\u20106, and IP\u201010 were significantly higher in H1N1 infected cases than in group 3, and levels of IL\u20106 and IP\u201010 were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. The level of IL\u201010 was significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2. However, levels of IFN\u2010\u03B3 and IL\u201017 were not significantly different between the three groups. IL\u20101\u03B2, IL\u20104, and MIP\u20101\u03B1 were not detectable in most patients. IP\u201010 and IL\u20106 levels were found to show negative correlations with lymphocyte count and oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: We found higher levels of cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03B1, IL\u20106, IP\u201010) of innate immunity than those of acquired immunity in pediatric H1N1 infection. Of the cytokines found to be increased in cases with H1N1 infection, IP\u201010 and IL\u20106 were found to be correlated with disease severity (lymphopenia and hypoxia). IP\u201010 and IL\u20106 may be important markers in pediatric H1N1 infection.

The systems approach offers users the flexibility to select, combine, rank, weigh and evaluate different attributes representing their perspectives, assumptions, and particular needs. This approach also overcomes concerns relating to the previous single-metric ranking approaches that yielded lists that, once published, were static, and could not readily accommodate new information about emerging pathogens, new scientific advances, or changes in the costs and performance features of interventions. We discuss the rationale and reasoning behind the design of this multi-criteria decision support approach, stakeholder feedback about the tool, and highlight the potential advantages from using this expanded approach to better inform and support vaccine policies.","publish_time":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phelps, Charles E.; Madhavan, Guruprasad; Gellin, Bruce","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab02d59cd9f13d9667b2cc9913b24f81818c0b8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131338.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1631057X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.09.072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1631057X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28017444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Institute of Medicine"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["expanded approach","multi-criteria decision support approach","broader multi-criteria systems approach","different metrics","new information","processes","new vaccine candidates","new scientific advances","support vaccine policies","different attributes","earlier metrics","Institute of Medicine","stakeholder feedback","time","changes","design","emerging pathogens","previous single-metric ranking approaches","costs","perspectives","assumptions","National Academies of Sciences","methodologies","tool","sequence of strategic planning efforts","infant mortality equivalents","United States","software system","Engineering","potential advantages","flexibility","performance features of interventions","particular needs","lists","various considerations","reasoning","concerns","priority","users","implementation","rationale","cost-effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

Our results showed that light intensity was a beneficial parameter for dye removal. The results showed that in the presence of S2O8 2\u2212, the photooxidation quantum yield obtained was higher than direct photolysis quantum yield, suggesting that photodecay of BY2 was dominated by photooxidation.

In the present study, we investigated the whole genomic sequence of a SARS-like bat CoV (16BO133) and found it to be 29,075 nt in length with a 40.9% G\u002BC content. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of the ORF 1ab and the spike gene showed that the bat coronavirus strain 16BO133 was grouped with the Beta-CoV lineage B and was closely related to the JTMC15 strain isolated from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in China. However, 16BO133 was distinctly located in the phylogenetic topology of the human SARS CoV strain (Tor2). Interestingly, 16BO133 showed complete elimination of ORF8 regions induced by a frame shift of the stop codon in ORF7b. The lowest amino acid identity of 16BO133 was identified at the spike region among various ORFs. The spike region of 16BO133 showed 84.7% and 75.2% amino acid identity with Rf1 (SARS-like bat CoV) and Tor2 (human SARS CoV), respectively. In addition, the S gene of 16BO133 was found to contain the amino acid substitution of two critical residues (N479S and T487 V) associated with human infection. In conclusion, we firstly carried out whole genome characterization of the SARS-like bat coronavirus discovered in the Republic of Korea; however, it presumably has no human infectivity. However, continuous surveillance and genomic characterization of coronaviruses from bats are necessary due to potential risks of human infection induced by genetic mutation.

Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes. Molecular weights of heavy (IgA, IgG, IgM) and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis, and as expected, they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins. In order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response, eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) and serum anti-DNP responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for one year. The full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response, and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species.","publish_time":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flies, Andrew S.; Grant, Chris K.; Mansfield, Linda S.; Tsao, Jean; Smith, Eric J.; Weldele, Mary L.; Holekamp, Kay E.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92bc94fd5b84fa6b14a8eb33ae724b8e74a3286b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb9dd0cc6798855dbdc9f5194636243b353cad4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3273618.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242711004235; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3273618?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22173276/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.10.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242711004235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Spotted hyenas","hyena antibody response","isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies","hyena humoral response","anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies","hyena Ig epitopes","hyena immunoglobulin epitopes","light chains of hyena immunoglobulins","specific cross-reaction","immune function","feline immunoglobulins","array of isotype","closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas","serum anti-DNP responses","Crocuta crocuta","ELISA","immune systems of animals","DNP-KLH","tools available","cross-reactivity","broad array of pathogens","dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin","IgG","hypotheses","pathogen exposure","IgM","Felis catus","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","outbreaks","surviving microbial assaults","IgA","extreme disease resistance","viral diseases","selective pressures","Western blots","Molecular weights of heavy","anthrax","scavenging","capable hunters","objective","populations of sympatric carnivores","future studies","rabies infections","Domestic cats","food","Theory","species","protein electrophoresis","researchers","veterinarians","immunization","carrion feeding ancestors","year","order"],"language":"en"},

Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal fluctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion. However, within this range, we identified significant temporal variation in these parameters, in urinary parameters and body condition, which primarily reflected the normal annual life cycle. We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our findings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the findings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.","publish_time":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"McMichael, Lee; Edson, Daniel; Mayer, David; McLaughlin, Amanda; Goldspink, Lauren; Vidgen, Miranda E.; Kopp, Steven; Meers, Joanne; Field, Hume","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7efff30daffe435863de2b8b80aba44969d508f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026357/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-016-1113-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Queensland"],"keyphrases":["physiological associations","normal range","suite of physiological biomarkers","seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers","alecto","underlying temporal physiological changes","normal species reference range","assessment of putative physiological risk factors","Hendra virus infection","reported reference range","evident effect of remarkable physiological demands","infection status","normal annual life cycle","life-cycle","findings","parameter values","biochemical parameter","population level","possible associations","urinary parameters","epidemiological studies","ecological factors","seasonal fluctuations","adjusted population","genus Pteropus","infectious disease","significant temporal variation","knowledge of Pteropus populations","indication of clinical disease","natural host of multiple emerging pathogenic viruses of animal","human health significance","relative resistance","terms","nutritional stress","henipaviruses","resilience","flying-foxes","time","Australian state of Queensland","lyssaviruses","Pteropodidae","body condition","sampling occasion","environmental stressors","Bats","month period","ebolaviruses"],"language":"en"},

We parameterise the model using census data, HIV data and mobile phone data adopted to track human mobility. We found that movement between different regions appears to have a relatively small overall effect on the total increase in HIV cases in Kenya. However, the most important consequence of movement patterns was transmission of the disease from high infection to low prevalence areas. Mobility slightly increases HIV incidence rates in regions with initially low HIV prevalences and slightly decreases incidences in regions with initially high HIV prevalence. We discuss how regional HIV models could be used in public-health planning.

We reported an outbreak of 70 cases of severe pneumonia with one death of infants in Shaanxi Province, China. Sampling showed adenovirus 7 (Ad7) as the primary pathogen with some co-infections. RESULTS: Two strains of adenovirus and two strains of enterovirus were isolated, the 21 pharynx swabs showed 14 positive amplifications for adenovirus; three co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus, two positive for rhinovirus, one positive for parainfluenza 3, and four negative. Adenovirus typing showed nine of the nine adenovirus positive samples were HAdV-7, three were HAdV-3 and two were too weak to perform sequencing. The entire hexon gene of adenovirus was sequenced and analyzed for the two adenovirus serotype 7 isolates, showing the nucleic acid homology was 99.8% between the two strains and 99.5% compared to the reference strain HAdV-7 (GenBank accession number AY769946). For the 21 acute phase serum samples from the 21 patients, six samples had positives results for ELISA detection of HAdV IgA, and the neutralization titers of the convalescent-phase samples were four times higher than those of the acute-phase samples in nine pairs.

Nanofiber filter can capture effectively these nano-aerosols. However, over time the pressure drop increases dramatically and cleaning of the filter by backpulse/backblow is essential for filter reuse. The cyclic loading-and-cleaning of a nanofiber filter has been investigated for the first time experimentally and theoretically. The \u201Cskin\u201D layer, a thin region upstream of the nanofiber filter, plays a pivoting role in controlling the pressure drop excursion of the filter. We model the skin layer to be made up of numerous fine capillaries and examine how continuous aerosols deposited in the capillaries affect rapid rise in pressure drop followed by bridging of aerosols across the capillary openings leading to more bridging and ultimately formation of cake on top of the bridges and filter surface. We have been able to describe the deposition of aerosols in the capillary pores for depth filtration, the deposition of aerosols in the cake (surface filtration), and the intermediate bridging regime between these two. We can depict the complete pressure drop excursion including the S-shaped curve behavior from depth filtration transiting to surface filtration for a filter with severe skin effect. Our prediction matches extremely well with the 6 cycles of loading/cleaning on a 280-nm nanofiber filter subject to challenging nano-aerosols, 50\u2013400nm.

We have previously reported, for the first time, the development of recombinant NDVs designed for enhanced cancer therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, we have shown that NDV engineered to express interleukin-2 (IL-2) generates a robust therapeutic response associated with increased tumor-specific T-cell infiltration after intratumoral administration in mice. We have now demonstrated that this therapeutic response is dependent on T cells and we have investigated the potential to focus the NDV-induced immune response toward a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) to enhance the inherent therapeutic efficacy of NDV further. We found that intratumoral treatments of tumor-bearing mice with recombinant NDV expressing a model TAA elicited an enhanced tumor-specific response, resulting in a significant increase in the number of complete tumor regressions compared with control NDV. Additionally, coadministration of NDV expressing a model TAA with NDV expressing IL-2 enhanced the TAA-directed response and led to more complete tumor regressions. Our results show that TAA-directed immunotherapy by oncolytic recombinant NDV alone or in combination with IL-2 results in an enhanced therapeutic efficacy and warrant consideration in the development of cancer therapies based on the use of oncolytic NDV.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vigil, Adam; Martinez, Osvaldo; Chua, Mark A; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e895e6fb68c49bd9bd3c701364dbd3c225bf620.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2878970.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616326879; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616326879; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2008.181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18714310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","TAA"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["control NDV","coadministration of NDV","oncolytic recombinant NDV","inherent therapeutic efficacy of NDV","use of oncolytic NDV","enhanced tumor-specific response","enhanced therapeutic efficacy","enhanced cancer therapeutic efficacy","robust therapeutic response","model TAA","intratumoral treatments of tumor","tumor-associated antigen","immune response","number of complete tumor regressions","oncolytic cancer therapy","increased tumor-specific T-cell infiltration","development of recombinant NDVs","development of cancer therapies","mice","results","T cells","intratumoral administration","warrant consideration","multiple clinical trials","significant increase","combination","immunotherapy","strains of Newcastle disease virus","United States","time","potential","interleukin"],"language":"en"},

Patients may experience hepatic and renal injury as well as abnormal myocardial enzymes in varying degrees. Advanced age (\u226558) and accompanying chronic diseases were considered as independent predictors for developing a severe and critically ill population with increased mortality. Laboratory results regarding the NEU percentage, NLR, ALC, and C-reactive protein levels were considered significant in predicting clinically critical disease or for prognosis assessment and thus require further studies.

Thus, adjuvants are important for vaccine research. Polysaccharides isolated from select Chinese herbs have been demonstrated to possess various beneficial functions and excellent adjuvant abilities. In the present study, the polysaccharides IIP-A-1 and IIP-2 were isolated from Isatis indigotica root and compared with the common vaccine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide via intramuscular co-administration of inactivated rabies virus rCVS-11-G into mice. Blood was collected to determine virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers and B and T lymphocyte activation status. Inguinal lymph node samples were collected and used to measure B lymphocyte proliferation. Splenocytes were isolated, from which antigen-specific cellular immune responses were detected via ELISpot, ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining. The results revealed that both types of polysaccharides induce more rapid changes and higher VNA titers than aluminum hydroxide. Flow cytometry assays revealed that the polysaccharides activated more B lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and more B and T lymphocytes in the blood than aluminum hydroxide. Antigen-specific cellular immune responses showed that IIP-2 strongly induced T lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and high levels of cytokine secretion from splenocytes, whereas aluminum hydroxide induced proliferation in only a small number of lymphocytes and the secretion of only small quantities of cytokines. Collectively, these data suggest that the polysaccharide IIP-2 exhibits excellent adjuvant activity and can enhance both cellular and humoral immunity.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Weijiao; Zheng, Xuexing; Cheng, Nan; Gai, Weiwei; Xue, Xianghong; Wang, Yuxia; Gao, Yuwei; Shan, Junjie; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu","journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52fd553c11cbb5847e82f6679eddb6f205266cfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26875535/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.02.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813016301556; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813016301556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polysaccharides IIP","B lymphocytes","B lymphocyte proliferation","aluminum hydroxide induced proliferation","common vaccine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide","T lymphocytes","induced T lymphocyte proliferation","antigen-specific cellular immune responses","polysaccharide IIP","types of polysaccharides","vaccine immunogenicity","excellent adjuvant abilities","excellent adjuvant activity","Splenocytes","T lymphocyte activation status","small number of lymphocytes","long-term enhancement of immune responses","vaccine research","Blood","higher VNA titers","high levels of cytokine secretion","lymph nodes","Abstract Adjuvants","intracellular cytokine staining","small quantities of cytokines","Inguinal lymph node samples","intramuscular co-administration of inactivated rabies virus rCVS","spleen","ELISpot","rapid changes","various beneficial functions","ELISA","antibody","Isatis indigotica root","Flow cytometry assays","present study","Chinese herbs","mice","humoral immunity","results","data"],"language":"en"},

To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods. Between March 28 and June 30 \u00272003, 29 patients with probable SARS seen at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, were analysed. Results. Presenting symptoms included fever (100%), cough (69.0%), chills or rigor (62.1%), and shortness of breath (41.4%). Mean days to defervescence were 6.8\u00B12.9 days, but fever recurred in 15 patients (51.7%) at 10.9\u00B13.4 days. Common laboratory features included lymphopenia (72.4%), thrombocytopenia (34.5%) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (93.1, 62.1, 44.8%, respectively). All patients except one had initial abnormal chest radiographs and 20 (69.0%) had radiological worsening at 7.5\u00B12.6 days. Nine patients (31.0%) subsequently required mechanical ventilation with four deaths (13.8%). Most patients with clinical deterioration responded to pulse corticosteroid therapy (14 out of 17) but six complicated with nosocomial infections. The risk factors associated with severe disease were presence of diarrhoea, high peak LDH and CRP, high AST and creatine kinase on admission and high peak values. Conclusions. Prudent corticosteroid use, vigilant microbiological surveillance and appropriate antibiotics coverage are the key to successful treatment.","publish_time":"2003-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, T.-N; Yeh, D.Y; Shen, S.-H; Huang, C.-H; Jiang, J.-S; Kao, S.-J","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4224b1ef00b2907298fb4cb0965aac20d598693e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127319.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445303001804; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445303001804","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of patients","high AST","Mean days","high peak LDH","CRP","high peak values","fever","severe disease","probable SARS","clinical deterioration","clinical characteristics","Prudent corticosteroid use","pulse corticosteroid therapy","severe acute respiratory syndrome","vigilant microbiological surveillance","Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital","appropriate antibiotics coverage","creatine kinase","presence of diarrhoea","admission","key","elevated C-reactive protein","lactate dehydrogenase","lymphopenia","Taipei","initial abnormal chest radiographs","successful treatment","risk factors","aspartate aminotransferase","Common laboratory features","defervescence","chills","mechanical ventilation","deaths","nosocomial infections","thrombocytopenia","cough","radiological worsening","shortness of breath","rigor","symptoms","Objectives","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to examine the content of news segments covering COVID-19 posted on-line. Methods Using the Google Videos function on a cleared browser, all videos identified from January and February, 2020 were archived by URL for analysis. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 401 remained, comprising the sample. Content categories derived from trusted sources were applied to assess the content of broadcast news segments pertaining to COVID-19 on Google Videos. Results The most common topic mentioned across all videos was death and the death rate (43.6%) and many connoted anxieties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak (37.4%). Critically important information about the prevention of COVID-19 spread received little attention. For example, only 3.0% of videos discussed coughing into or blowing one\u0027s nose into a tissue and throwing the tissue away, 6.2% talked about wearing a facemask when caring for the ill, and 8.8% covered disinfecting highly touched objects and surfaces. International videos more often presented captions and English subtitles (with and without narration) (7.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018) and even more frequently discussed death and the death rate associated with COVID-19 (56.9% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.04).

The current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence, and the need for better vaccines are urgent. The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-\u03B1/\u03B2) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity. Thus, IFN antagonism-negative PRRSV is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad- spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs.

Respiratory viruses nucleic acids (24 detections) were observed in 17 (50%) OSA samples. In contrast, no virus was detected in RI samples (relative frequency P \u003C 0.0001). Viruses detected, based on frequency were Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and corona virus. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are detected in OSA hypertrophic tonsils, suggestive of their role in the evolution of tonsillar inflammation and hypertrophy. Early life viral infections may contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric OSA.

Typically the transmembrane glycoproteins of class I fusion proteins contain the oligomerization domains and the surface glycoproteins (SU) are monomeric. However, it has been previously demonstrated [J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 19727] that the SU of a murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) forms dimers, the dimerization domain overlaps the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and that this dimeric state is important for binding to receptor molecules that initiates entry into cells. We have previously expressed various soluble fragments of the SARS-CoV SU and identified stably folded fragments (residues 272\u2013537) that contain the RBD [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Here, we further characterize these and other fragments in an attempt to identify possible dimerization domains and their role for membrane fusion. We demonstrate that the SU and a shorter 260-amino acid N-terminal fragment (residues 17\u2013276), which folds independently, form dimers. In contrast to the previously characterized MHV SU dimerization, this fragment is upstream and distinct from the RBD. Its deletion abolished S-mediated cell membrane fusion but retained the SU-receptor-binding function indicating the possibility for a role in post-receptor binding steps of the virus entry mechanism. Interestingly, the whole soluble S ectodomain (Se) that contains the dimerization domain but not the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail forms trimers suggesting the existence of a trimerization domain in the TM subunit in its prefusion state that may lead to a conformation unfavorable for formation of higher-order multimeric structures. These results demonstrate the existence of SU dimers and Se trimers, and indicate the possibility for an unknown mechanism of their role in entry. They also further characterize the S-mediated membrane fusion and could be important for understanding the mechanisms of virus entry, and in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.","publish_time":"2004-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaodong; Feng, Yang; Chakraborti, Samitabh; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b66b064e94b60ab820ff185c2dd2bd238eda520a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092807.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04015542; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04015542","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD","MHV SU","TM"],"locations":["Res","Commun"],"keyphrases":["SU-receptor","receptor-binding domain","existence of SU dimers","transmembrane domain","characterized MHV SU dimerization","S-mediated membrane fusion","membrane fusion activity","trimerization domain","fusion proteins","SARS-CoV SU","role","S-mediated cell membrane fusion","RBD","virus entry mechanism","post-receptor binding steps","receptor molecules","binding function","forms dimers","possible dimerization domains","mechanisms of virus entry","Se trimers","surface glycoproteins","transmembrane glycoproteins of class","possibility","folded fragments","various soluble fragments","soluble S ectodomain","form dimers","residues","cytoplasmic tail forms trimers","oligomerization domains","Abstract Viral envelope glycoproteins","dimeric state","prefusion state","unknown mechanism","amino acid N-terminal fragment","formation of higher","quaternary structure","murine hepatitis coronavirus","TM subunit","order multimeric structures","conformation unfavorable","attempt","deletion","development of therapeutics","contrast","cells","results","vaccines","Biochem","Biophys","Commun"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data on the global outbreak of \u00222019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV\u0022 were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia.

In the first instance, Q fever was mainly a local problem of one province with a high density of large dairy goat farms, but in 2009 an alarming increase of Q fever cases was observed in adjacent provinces. The aim of this study was to identify trends over time and regional differences in public perceptions and behaviors, as well as predictors of preventive behavior regarding Q fever. METHODS: One cross-sectional survey (2009) and two follow-up surveys (2010, 2012) were performed. Adults, aged \u226518 years, that participated in a representative internet panel were invited (survey 1, n = 1347; survey 2, n = 1249; survey 3, n = 1030). RESULTS: Overall, public perceptions and behaviors regarding Q fever were consistent with the trends over time in the numbers of new human Q fever cases in different epidemiological regions and the amount of media attention focused on Q fever in the Netherlands. However, there were remarkably low levels of perceived vulnerability and perceived anxiety, particularly in the region of highest incidence, where three-quarters of the total cases occurred in 2009. Predictors of preventive behavior were being female, older aged, having Q fever themselves or someone in their household, more knowledge, and higher levels of perceived severity, anxiety and (self-) efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: During future outbreaks of (zoonotic) infectious diseases, it will be important to instil a realistic sense of vulnerability by providing the public with accurate information on the risk of becoming infected. This should be given in addition to information about the severity of the disease, the efficacy of measures, and instructions for minimising infection risk with appropriate, feasible preventative measures. Furthermore, public information should be adapted to regional circumstances.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bults, Marloes; Beaujean, Desir\u00E9e; Wijkmans, Clementine; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Voeten, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22371f1a9a91782adf48ffc5ad7d54d9a7a61b13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4108011.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alarming increase of Q fever cases","numbers of new human Q fever cases","public information","public perceptions","human cases","perceived anxiety","total cases","cross-sectional survey","major public health problem","time","higher levels of perceived severity","low levels of perceived vulnerability","behaviors","trends","predictors of preventive behavior","efficacy of measures","accurate information","Netherlands","regional differences","local problem","regional circumstances","past years","minimising infection risk","feasible preventative measures","realistic sense of vulnerability","different epidemiological regions","instructions","high density of large dairy goat farms","female","future outbreaks","infectious diseases","media attention","quarters","knowledge","region of highest incidence","representative internet panel","adjacent provinces","study","household","peak","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","addition","RESULTS","instance","follow-up surveys","aim","Adults"],"language":"en"},

Prior studies have described an association of increased self-reported colds and influenza-like symptoms with low ventilation but have not combined rigorous characterization of ventilation with assessment of laboratory confirmed infections. We report a study designed to fill this gap. We followed laboratory confirmed ARI rates and measured CO2 concentrations for four months during the winter-spring of 2018 in two campus residence halls: (1) a high ventilation building (HVB) with a dedicated outdoor air system that supplies 100% of outside air to each dormitory room, and (2) a low ventilation building (LVB) that relies on infiltration as ventilation. We enrolled 11 volunteers for a total of 522 person-days in the HVB and 109 volunteers for 6069 person-days in the LVB, and tested upper-respiratory swabs from symptomatic cases and their close contacts for the presence of 44 pathogens using a molecular assay. We observed one ARI case in the HVB (0.70/person-year) and 47 in the LVB (2.83/person-year). Simultaneously, 154 CO2 sensors distributed primarily in the dormitory rooms collected 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million recorded data points. Average and standard deviation of CO2 concentrations were 1230 ppm and 408 ppm in the HVB, and 1492 ppm and 837 ppm in the LVB, respectively. Importantly, this study developed and calibrated multi-zone models for the HVB with 229 zones and 983 airflow paths, and for the LVB with 529 zones and 1836 airflow paths by using a subset of CO2 data for model calibration. The models were used to calculate ventilation rates in the two buildings and potential for viral aerosol migration between rooms in the LVB. With doors and windows closed, the average ventilation rate was 12 L/s in the HVB dormitory rooms and 4 L/s in the LVB dormitory rooms. As a result, residents had on average 6.6 L/(s person) of outside air in the HVB and 2.3 L/(s person) in the LVB. LVB rooms located at the leeward side of the building had smaller average ventilation rates, as well as a somewhat higher ARI incidence rate and average CO2 concentrations when compared to those values in the rooms located at the windward side of the building. Average ventilation rates in twenty LVB dormitory rooms increased from 2.3 L/s to 7.5 L/s by opening windows, 3.6 L/s by opening doors, and 8.8 L/s by opening both windows and doors. Therefore, opening both windows and doors in the LVB dormitory rooms can increase ventilation rates to the levels comparable to those in the HVB. But it can also have a negative effect on thermal comfort due to low outdoor temperatures. Simulation results identified an aerobiologic pathway from a room occupied by an index case of influenza A to a room occupied by a possible secondary case.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shengwei; Jenkins, Sara; Addo, Kofi; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Romo, Sebastian A.; Layne, Avery; Ehizibolo, Joshua; Dalgo, Daniel; Mattise, Nicholas W.; Hong, Filbert; Adenaiye, Oluwasanmi O.; Bueno de Mesquita, Jacob P.; Albert, Barbara J.; Washington-Lewis, Rhonda; German, Jennifer; Tai, Sheldon; Youssefi, Somayeh; Milton, Donald K.; Srebric, Jelena","journal":"Environment International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77cb14134e410b6234264e94558a1c306fe435b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112667.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412019341108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32028176/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019341108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["HVB","LVB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LVB rooms","LVB dormitory rooms","HVB dormitory rooms","s person","low ventilation building","smaller average ventilation rates","high ventilation building","average CO2 concentrations","ARI rates","rigorous characterization of ventilation","ppm","person-days","person-year","windows","doors","ARI case","measured CO2 concentrations","subset of CO2 data","CO2 sensors","building occupants","standard deviation of CO2 concentrations","outside air","higher ARI incidence rate","low outdoor temperatures","recorded data points","useful data points","airflow paths","index case of influenza","zones","volunteers","study","dedicated outdoor air system","possible secondary case","assessment of laboratory","upper-respiratory swabs","risk of acute respiratory infection","calibrated multi-zone models","association of increased self-reported colds","symptomatic cases","thermal comfort","potential","buildings","viral aerosol migration","close contacts","months","symptoms","pathogens","presence","aerobiologic pathway","model calibration","levels comparable","winter-spring","negative effect","campus residence halls","Simulation results","Abstract Strategies","ability","infections","total","values","molecular assay","Prior studies","indoor bioaerosols","residents","infiltration","gap"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that inactivation of the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates PEDV yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs. We generated a recombinant PEDV, KDKE(4A), with quadruple alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad of the 2\u2032-O-MTase using a virulent infectious cDNA clone, icPC22A, as the backbone. Next, we constructed another mutant, KDKE(4A)-SYA, by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of KDKE(4A). Compared with icPC22A, the KDKE(4A) and KDKE(4A)-SYA mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type I and type III interferon responses. The pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets. The virulence of KDKE(4A)-SYA and KDKE(4A) was significantly reduced compared with that of icPC22A. Mortality rates were 100%, 17%, and 0% in the icPC22A-, KDKE(4A)-, and KDKE(4A)-SYA-inoculated groups, respectively. At 21 days postinoculation (dpi), all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icPC22A. The KDKE(4A)-SYA- and KDKE(4A)-inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge, because no KDKE(4A)-SYA- and one KDKE(4A)-inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea, and 33% of them died. Furthermore, we serially passaged the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. The data suggest that KDKE(4A)-SYA may be a PEDV vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE PEDV is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries. Effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available. 2\u2032-O-MTase (nsp16) is highly conserved among coronaviruses (CoVs), and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses. We show that inactivation of both 2\u2032-O-MTase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for PEDV. The in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant. KDKE(4A)-SYA warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization. Our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for CoV vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging CoVs.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Yixuan; Ke, Hanzhong; Kim, Jineui; Yoo, Dongwan; Su, Yunfang; Boley, Patricia; Chepngeno, Juliet; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9daabd834fda1a065a169d0da404604fd0a3544.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6639265.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00406-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118255/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/15/e00406-19.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KDKE","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulence of KDKE","spike protein of KDKE","SYA mutants","SYA-inoculated groups","O-MTase","inoculated pigs","IMPORTANCE PEDV","recombinant PEDV","inactivation of nsp16","PEDV vaccine candidate","endocytosis signal","development of vaccines","safe vaccines","O-methyltransferase","surviving pigs","live attenuated vaccines","high dose of icPC22A","activity of nsp16","promising live attenuated vaccine","CoV vaccine development","severe diarrhea","mock-inoculated group","high mortality","neonatal piglets","gnotobiotic piglets","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","stronger type","emerging CoVs","Mortality rates","passaging data","important porcine enteric viral pathogen","immense economic losses","virulent infectious cDNA clone","pork industries","universal target","approach","catalytic tetrad","quadruple alanine substitutions","times","interferon responses","reversion","stability","evaluation","sows","immunogenicity","challenge","introduced mutations","countries","pathogenesis","immunogenicities","backbone","days postinoculation","platform","optimization","betacoronaviruses","findings"],"language":"en"},

Here we investigate the mechanism of this effect for the first time, establishing that redistribution of Rev by Nullbasic is not due to direct interaction between the two proteins. Rather, Nullbasic affects subcellular localization of cellular proteins that regulate Rev trafficking. In particular, Nullbasic induced redistribution of exportin 1 (CRM1), nucleophosmin (B23) and nucleolin (C23) from the nucleolus to the nucleus when Rev was coexpressed, but never in its absence. Inhibition of the Rev:CRM1 interaction by leptomycin B or a non-interacting RevM10 mutant completely blocked redistribution of Rev by Nullbasic. Finally, Nullbasic did not inhibit importin \u03B2- or transportin 1-mediated nuclear import, suggesting that cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev was due to increased export by CRM1. Overall, our data support the conclusion that CRM1-dependent subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleolus by Nullbasic is not through general perturbation of either nuclear import or export. Rather, Nullbasic appears to interact with and disrupt specific components of a Rev trafficking complex required for its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and, in particular, its nucleolar accumulation.","publish_time":"2012-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Min-Hsuan; Sivakumaran, Haran; Apolloni, Ann; Wei, Ting; Jans, David A.; Harrich, David","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5421a028a9ff8b2f36ad9be3c51d3d0cb78ddd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519632.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rev protein","blocked redistribution of Rev","CRM1-dependent subcellular redistribution of Rev","Rev trafficking complex","inhibition of Rev function","cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev","Nullbasic induced redistribution of exportin","CRM1 interaction","nucleolus","anti-HIV","nuclear import","subcellular localization of cellular proteins","Tat protein","direct interaction","increased export","nucleolar accumulation","non-interacting RevM10 mutant","leptomycin B","mechanisms","conclusion","general perturbation","nucleocytoplasmic shuttling","nucleolin","B23","transportin","nucleophosmin","activity","specific components","C23","nucleoplasm","importin \u03B2","time","effect","data","nucleus","absence"],"language":"en"},

The study conducted a survey among ICPs from 425 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 227 valid questionnaire responses were returned from the ICPs from 90 hospitals. Among these responses, 55.00% are from medical centers and 47.83% are from regional hospitals.

The results do show that SARS-CoV follows the general fusion mechanism of class I viruses and this lays the ground for identification of virus fusion/entry inhibitors for this devastating emerging virus.","publish_time":"2004-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jieqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Xu, Yanhui; Yuan, Fang; Zheng, Congyi; Liu, Yueyong; Yan, Huimin; Cole, David K; Bell, John I; Rao, Zihe; Tien, Po; Gao, George F","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9f0b6eb74685972364b796a69bc0889d195707a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111185.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X0400912X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0400912X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Family Coronaviridae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV HR1","identification of virus fusion","fusion core","HR2","viral fusion protein","GST-fusion polypeptide","general fusion mechanism of class","potent inhibitor of virus entry","devastating emerging virus","entry inhibitors","Coronavirus envelope spike protein S","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","viruses","bio-engineering techniques","heptad","regions","ground","identified member of Family Coronaviridae","synthetic peptide","existence","complex","helix bundle","results"],"language":"en"},

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Secondly since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development which aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation.

It is the terminal component of an RNA cleavage pathway in which dsRNA induces the production of RNase-L-activating 2-5A by the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase. The active nuclease then cleaves ssRNAs, both cellular and viral, leading to downregulation of their expression and the generation of small RNAs capable of activating retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors or the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This leads to IFN\u03B2 expression and IL-1\u03B2 activation respectively, in addition to broader effects on immune cell function. RNase-L is also one of a growing number of innate immune components that interact with the cell cytoskeleton. It can bind to several cytoskeletal proteins, including filamin A, an actin-binding protein that collaborates with RNase-L to maintain the cellular barrier to viral entry. This antiviral activity is independent of catalytic function, a unique mechanism for RNase-L. We also describe here the interaction of RNase-L with the E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding protein, ligand of nump protein X (LNX), a regulator of tight junction proteins. In order to better understand the significance and context of these novel binding partners in the antimicrobial response, other innate immune protein interactions with the cytoskeleton are also discussed.","publish_time":"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ezelle, Heather J.; Malathi, Krishnamurthy; Hassel, Bret A.","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f21f365d6a8983fd6cf0406c66d2785d0c3a138.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4730318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26760998/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17010074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNase-","production of RNase","interaction of RNase","innate immune protein interactions","antimicrobial innate immune response","actin-binding protein","immune cell function","regulated endoribonuclease RNase","scaffolding protein","antimicrobial response","growing number of innate immune components","cell cytoskeleton","ligand of nump protein X","novel binding partners","nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","IFN\u03B2 expression","cellular barrier","viral entry","cytoskeletal proteins","independent of catalytic function","regulator of tight junction proteins","LNX","addition","generation of small RNAs capable","RNA cleavage pathway","broader effects","retinoic acid-inducible gene","E3 ubiquitin ligase","\u03B2 activation","dsRNA","multiple aspects","unique mechanism","terminal component","antiviral activity","significance","receptors","context","ssRNAs","filamin","downregulation","NLRP3","RIG","interferon","active nuclease","inflammasome","oligoadenylate synthetase","order"],"language":"en"},

The Kaplan-Meier survival curves over 60 days revealed a lower survival probability in the virus positive group (n = 15, 60%) than in the virus negative group (n = 60, 83.3%, p \u003C 0.05). However, the virus infection itself could not predict the 60-day survival probability using simple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions Viral infections, mostly CMV or HHV7, were identified in both patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and non-IPF ILDs, but the clinical significance on short-term mortality or isolation itself from respiratory samples remains to be determined.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saraya, Takeshi; Kimura, Hirokazu; Kurai, Daisuke; Tamura, Masaki; Ogawa, Yukari; Mikura, Sunao; Sada, Mitsuru; Oda, Miku; Watanabe, Takayasu; Ohkuma, Kosuke; Inoue, Manami; Honda, Kojiro; Watanabe, Masato; Yokoyama, Takuma; Fujiwara, Masachika; Ishii, Haruyuki; Takizawa, Hajime","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0947a35502744e637d52a54eec99babfb580d499.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501253/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2018.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611118300325; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611118300325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute exacerbation of IPF","non-IPF ILDs groups","non-IPF interstitial lung disease","frequency of virus infections","proportion of virus infections","enrolled adult patients","respiratory samples","HHV7","virus positive group","virus negative group","acute exacerbations","impact of viral infections","Conclusions Viral infections","IIP","idiopathic interstitial pneumonia","lower survival probability","day survival probability","associated pneumonia","short-term mortality","CMV","CTD-associated IP","Kaplan-Meier survival curves","idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","connective tissue disease","clinical significance","sputum","days","isolation","simple logistic regression analysis","human herpesvirus","Abstract Background","influence","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","Methods","years","cytomegalovirus","Objectives","hospital","viruses","total"],"language":"en"},

Safe, appropriate pressure in endotracheal tube cuffs is considered to be between 15 and 25 cm H2O, pressures below normal capillary perfusion pressure. We seek to determine the ability of emergency medicine residents and attending physicians in accredited emergency medicine residency training programs to inflate an endotracheal tube cuff to appropriate pressure using standard syringe technique and assess appropriateness of pressure of previously inflated endotracheal tube cuffs by palpating the pilot balloon. Methods: This institutional review board\u2013approved descriptive survey of resident and attending physicians in accredited emergency medicine residency training programs in New York City used a previously tested, tracheal simulation model with a 7.5-mm endotracheal tube with a high-volume low-pressure cuff (Mallinkrodt, St. Louis, MO). Using their choice of a 5-mL or 10-mL plastic syringe with standard Luer Lock (Beckton-Dickson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), participants inflated the endotracheal tube cuff by standard method of injecting air as they deemed appropriate in conjunction with palpating the pilot balloon to estimate cuff pressure. Subsequently, the endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured using a highly sensitive and accurate analog manometer (Boehringer Laboratories, Norristown, PA). Later, participants palpated the pilot balloon of 9 endotracheal tubes with cuffs previously inflated to known pressures ranging from 0 to 120 cm H2O and reported whether the pressure was low, appropriate, or high. Results: Twenty-five resident physicians and 42 attending physicians from 5 emergency medicine residency training programs were surveyed. Only 0.4% (n=3) of participants inflated the cuff to a safe pressure; all were attending physicians. The average cuff pressure generated by emergency medicine attending physicians was greater than 98 cm H2O (attending physicians \u003E93 cm H2O, residents \u003E106 cm H2O). The true mean could not be determined because 57% (n=38) inflated to pressures greater than the upper limit of manometer sensitivity (\u003E120 cm H2O). Using palpation, participants were only 33% sensitive detecting inappropriately inflated endotracheal tube cuffs (attending physicians 22% sensitive, residents 53% sensitive), and they were only 26% sensitive in detecting overinflated endotracheal tube cuffs (attending physicians 22%, residents 33%). Average experience as an attending emergency physician was 9 years; average experience as a resident was 2.1 years. Conclusion: This group of emergency physicians had little ability to inflate an endotracheal tube cuff to safe pressure, little ability to accurately estimate pressure of a previously inflated cuff using standard technique, and minimal ability to detect overinflated endotracheal tube cuffs. Nearly all inflated the cuff to dangerously high pressures. Clinicians should consider using devices that permit safe and accurate inflation and measurement of endotracheal tube cuff pressure rather than relying on standard palpation technique, which is potentially unsafe and highly inaccurate.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffman, R.

Genes of the innate immune system including Toll-like receptors and their downstream molecules and inflammatory cytokines were significantly down-regulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinases were up-regulated in larvae. In addition, recombination-activating genes in the immature adaptive immune system were significantly reduced. Thus, immune defense is diminished by exposing parental generations of zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentration of bisphenols and this suggests that fish chronically exposed to bisphenols in the wild may be vulnerable to pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Xing; Zhang, Zhen; Meng, Shunlong; Pan, Chenyuan; Yang, Ming; Wu, Xiangyang; Yang, Liuqing; Xu, Hai","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f29e78dd106a5a5ce4224736699ffe7b9a9d71c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717320557; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969717320557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune defense","offspring immune function","innate immune system","effects of parental","oxidative defense genes","F1 larvae","immature adaptive immune system","hpf","parental generations of zebrafish","bisphenol S","modified immunity","h post-fertilization","relevant concentration of bisphenols","bacterial mimic Pam3Cys-Ser","viral mimic polyinosinic-cytidylic acid","Abstract Transgenerational effects of environmental pollutants","respiratory burst response","humans","receptors","Lys4","continued chemicals treatment","analogs","life cycle exposure","Toll","downstream molecules","animals","inflammatory cytokines","PAM3CSK4","recombination","Data","lysozyme activity","pathogens","addition","matrix metalloproteinases","adulthood"],"language":"en"},

There is a widespread of interest in using natural products as antiviral agents, and among them, licorice derived from Glycyrrhiza spp. has exerted antiviral properties against several viruses. In this study, anti-rotaviral efficacy of Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract (GUE) as an effective and cheaper remedy without side-effects was evaluated in colostrums-deprived piglets after induction of rotavirus diarrhea. METHODS: Colostrums-deprived piglets were inoculated with porcine rotavirus K85 (G5P[7]) strain. On the onset of diarrhea, piglets were treated with different concentration of GUE. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of GUE, fecal consistency score, fecal virus shedding and histological changes of the small intestine, mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines (IL8, IL10, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1), signaling molecules (p38 and JNK), and transcription factor (NF\u03BAB) in the small intestine and spleen were determined. RESULTS: Among the dosages (100-400 mg/ml) administrated to animals, 400 mg/ml of GUE cured diarrhea, and markedly improved small intestinal lesion score and fecal virus shedding. mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines (IL8, IL10, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1), signaling molecules (p38 and JNK), and transcription factor (NF\u03BAB) in the small intestine and spleen were markedly increased in animals with RVA-induced diarrhea, but dose- dependently decreased in GUE treated animals after RVA-induced diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: GUE cures rotaviral enteritis by coordinating antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Therapy of this herbal medicine can be a viable medication for curing rotaviral enteritis in animals and humans.","publish_time":"2012-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Park, Jun-Gyu; Ryu, Eun-Hye; Kim, Ji-Yun; Jeong, Young-Ju; Kim, Deok-Song; Hosmillo, Myra; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Lee, Ju-Hwan; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Ryu, Young Bae; Park, Su-Jin; Park, Sang-Ik; Lee, Woo Song; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29da5f5d00af5c47f9b3a0a49d561f8caffb0cf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3547719.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23244491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GUE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral efficacy of GUE","animals","small intestine","GUE cures rotaviral enteritis","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B3","induction of rotavirus diarrhea","RVA-induced diarrhea","onset of diarrhea","different concentration of GUE","antiviral agents","antiviral properties","curing rotaviral enteritis","fecal virus shedding","colostrums-deprived piglets","effective anti-rotaviral drugs","fecal consistency score","related cytokines","mRNA expression levels of inflammation","IL8","IL10","anti-rotaviral efficacy of Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract","TNF-\u03B1","JNK","p38","molecules","transcription factor","NF\u03BAB","spleen","improved small intestinal lesion score","porcine rotavirus K85","viable medication","serious threat","histological changes","severe gastroenteritis","animal health","side-effects","researchers","herbal medicine","G5P","leading pathogens","natural products","cheaper remedy","humans","study","CONCLUSIONS","dose","anti-inflammatory effects","METHODS","Therapy","licorice","viruses","RESULTS","dosages","strain","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated the effect of matching/mismatching vaccine strains, type/subtype pattern changes in Taiwan\u0027s influenza viruses, and the impact of post-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) public health efforts on excess influenza-associated mortalities among the elderly. A negative binomial model was developed to estimate Taiwan\u0027s monthly influenza-associated mortality among the elderly. We calculated three winter and annual excess influenza-associated mortalities [pneumonia and influenza (P\u0026I), respiratory and circulatory, and all-cause] from the 1999\u20132000 through the 2006\u20132007 influenza seasons. Obtaining influenza virus sequences from the months/years in which death from P\u0026I was excessive, we investigated molecular variation in vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses by comparing hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of the circulating and vaccine strains. We found that the higher the isolation rate of A (H3N2) and vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses, the greater the monthly P\u0026I mortality. However, this significant positive association became negative for higher matching of A (H3N2) and public health efforts with post-SARS effect. Mean excess P\u0026I mortality for winters was significantly higher before 2003 than after that year [mean \u00B1 S.D.: 1.44\u00B11.35 vs. 0.35\u00B11.13, p = 0.04]. Further analysis revealed that vaccine-matched circulating influenza A viruses were significantly associated with lower excess P\u0026I mortality during post-SARS winters (i.e., 2005\u20132007) than during pre-SARS winters [0.03\u00B10.06 vs. 1.57\u00B11.27, p = 0.01]. Stratification of these vaccine-matching and post-SARS effect showed substantial trends toward lower elderly excess P\u0026I mortalities in winters with either mismatching vaccines during the post-SARS period or matching vaccines during the pre-SARS period. Importantly, all three excess mortalities were at their highest in May, 2003, when inter-hospital nosocomial infections were peaking. Furthermore, vaccine-mismatched H3N2 viruses circulating in the years with high excess P\u0026I mortality exhibited both a lower amino acid identity percentage of HA1 between vaccine and circulating strains and a higher numbers of variations at epitope B. Our model can help future decision makers to estimate excess P\u0026I mortality effectively, select and test virus strains for antigenic variation, and evaluate public health strategy effectiveness.","publish_time":"2010-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Ta-Chien; Hsiao, Chuhsing Kate; Lee, Chang-Chun; Chiang, Po-Huang; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Liu, Chung-Ming; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18910856b917289b6bb3cc2cef0f78ff82ad4b02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2892467.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["excess influenza-associated mortality","lower excess P","vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses","high excess P","excess mortalities","lower elderly excess P","annual excess influenza-associated mortalities","Taiwan\u0027s influenza viruses","influenza seasons","vaccine-matched circulating influenza","monthly P","Taiwan\u0027s monthly influenza-associated mortality","post-SARS winters","post-SARS effect","vaccine-mismatched H3N2 viruses","post-SARS period","mismatching vaccine strains","influenza virus sequences","impact of post-SARS","pre-SARS winters","higher matching","pre-SARS period","effect of matching","public health efforts","Public health administrators","public health strategy effectiveness","test virus strains","mismatching vaccines","years","higher numbers of variations","mean","negative binomial model","antigenic variation","lower amino acid identity percentage of HA1","molecular variation","viral changes","subtype pattern changes","severe acute respiratory syndrome","substantial trends","effective models","pneumonia","future decision makers","epitope","months","significant positive association","death","hemagglutinin","inter-hospital nosocomial infections","all-cause","isolation rate","analysis","study","Stratification"],"language":"en"},

Methods Agendas in Committees A/B of the WHA were classified as Administrative or Technical and Health Matters. Agenda items of Health Matters were sorted into five categories by the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. The agenda items in each category and sub-category were counted. Results There were 1647 agenda items including 423 Health Matters, which were sorted into five categories: communicable diseases (107, 25.3%), health systems (81, 19.1%), noncommunicable diseases (59, 13.9%), preparedness surveillance and response (58, 13.7%), and health through the life course (36, 8.5%). Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, millennium development goals, influenza, and international health regulations, were discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones, but maternal and child health were discussed three times. The number of the agenda items differed for each Director-General\u0027s term of office. Conclusions The WHA agendas cover a variety of items, but not always reflect international health issues in terms of disease burden.

Little is known about the latter; thus, in the present study we described the morphology and histochemical characteristics of Paneth cells in healthy fetuses, and young and adult alpacas. For this purpose, samples of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken from 6 fetuses at different days of pregnancy (between days 221\u2013330), 66 offsprings (between 0 and 45-days-old) and 5 adult alpacas (\u003E2-years-old). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histological and morphometrical analysis using HE and Masson Trichomi\u0107s technique. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify Paneth cells using anti-lysozyme antibody. In addition, the lectinhistochemichal binding-pattern of Paneth cel\u013As granules was evaluated. Lyzozyme was immunohistochemically detected in the granules of Paneth cells from day 283 of pregnancy in all the small intestinal sections of the studied fetuses. In newborn alpacas Paneth cells were initially found in the duodenum, but the following days (days 18\u201321 after birth) they were also found in the ileum. Their size gradually increased after birth, but then no significant differences were found. In adult alpacas the number was lower than offsprings. We suggest that Paneth cells early differentiate in the small intestine of alpacas, and the increase in their number during the first two weeks of life strongly support their possible involvement in the intestinal defensive functions against the enteric diseases that occur during the lactancy stage.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"V\u00E1squez., Mar\u00EDa; Lira., Boris; Rodr\u00EDguez, Jos\u00E9; Falc\u00F3n, N\u00E9stor; Ocampo, Jorge; Nishida, Fabi\u00E1n; Barbeito, Claudio; Zanuzzi, Carolina","journal":"Tissue and Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5b9af582e34ae2868f436ef8fcfc1318f7c2da2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27233914/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2016.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040816615300173; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040816615300173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Masson","Lyzozyme"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["granules of Paneth cells","newborn alpacas Paneth cells","Abstract Paneth cells","adult alpacas","histochemical characteristics of Paneth cells","days-old","Paneth cel\u013As granules","small intestine of alpacas","secretory epithelial cells","following days","different days of pregnancy","healthy fetuses","studied fetuses","samples of duodenum","number","birth","ileum","offsprings","small intestinal sections","years-old","intestinal defensive functions","innate immune system","morphology","lectinhistochemichal binding-pattern","enteric diseases","possible involvement","morphometrical analysis","jejunum","anti-lysozyme antibody","Masson Trichomi\u0107s technique","addition","buffered formalin","weeks of life","purpose","mammals","increase","lactancy stage","present study","significant differences","Immunohistochemistry","size","Lyzozyme"],"language":"en"},

However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines, and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brady, Shannon C.; Zdraljevic, Stefan; Bisaga, Karol W.; Tanny, Robyn E.; Cook, Daniel E.; Lee, Daehan; Wang, Ye; Andersen, Erik C.","journal":"Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efdf0a3bdc300ce80392b2b52be33728db54a51f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6707474.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bleomycin-response variation","bleomycin responses","bleomycin resistance","bleomycin dosages","response differences","genetic determinants of bleomycin","CB4856 strains","identification of genetic differences","gene causes variation","wild strain","laboratory strain","N2","potential stress-response function of scb","novel nematode-specific gene","chromosome V","CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions","small genomic region","allele replacements","model organism Caenorhabditis elegans","cross","linkage mapping","treatment outcomes","rare variant present","recombinants","powerful chemotherapeutic drug","approach","isogenic lines","mechanism","individual patients","variety of cancers"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been implicated in the etiology of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigated RSV infection in Chilean adults with CAP using direct viral detection, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR), and serology (microneutralization assay). Methods. RSV, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria were studied by conventional and molecular techniques in adults aged \u226518 years presenting with CAP to the healthcare facilities in Santiago, Chile from February 2005 through December 2007. Results. All 356 adults with CAP enrolled had an acute blood sample collected at enrollment, and 184 had a convalescent blood sample. RSV was detected in 48 cases (13.4%). Immunofluorescence assay and viral isolation each detected only 1 infection (0.2%), whereas rtRT-PCR was positive in 32 (8.9%) cases and serology was positive in 20 (10.8%) cases. CAP clinical characteristics were similar in RSV-infected and non-RSV-infected cases. RSV-specific geometric mean serum-neutralizing antibody titer (GMST) was significantly lower at admission in the 48 RSV-infected cases compared with 308 non-RSV-infected adults (GMST in log(2): RSV/A 8.1 vs 8.9, and RSV/B 9.3 vs 10.4; P \u003C .02). Conclusions. RSV infection is frequent in Chilean adults with CAP. Microneutralization assay was as sensitive as rtRT-PCR in detecting RSV infection and is a good adjunct assay for diagnostic research. High RSV-specific serum-neutralizing antibody levels were associated with protection against common and severe infection. The development of a vaccine could prevent RSV-related CAP in adults.","publish_time":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luchsinger, Vivian; Piedra, Pedro A.; Ruiz, Mauricio; Zunino, Enna; Mart\u00EDnez, Mar\u00EDa Ang\u00E9lica; Machado, Clarisse; Fasce, Rodrigo; Ulloa, Mar\u00EDa Teresa; Fink, Maria Cristina; Lara, Pamela; Avenda\u00F1o, Luis F.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa28199c70227aa7189f847a1ee386cd240fdade.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107950.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22238168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","CAP"],"locations":["Santiago","Chile"],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","RSV-related CAP","non-RSV-infected adults","non-RSV-infected cases","High RSV-specific serum","RSV-specific geometric mean serum","Chilean adults","rtRT-PCR","microneutralization assay","severe infection","CAP clinical characteristics","Immunofluorescence assay","GMST","good adjunct assay","vs","serology","acute blood sample","convalescent blood sample","antibody titer","antibody levels","viral isolation","respiratory viruses","direct viral detection","Respiratory syncytial virus","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","protection","healthcare facilities","bacteria","enrollment","diagnostic research","pneumonia","Santiago","molecular techniques","years","vaccine","admission","etiology of adult community","development","Methods","Results","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

The clinical presentation resembled that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as encountered during the epidemic in 2002/2003. In both cases, acute renal failure was observed in humans. HCoV-EMC is a member of the same virus genus as SARS-CoV but constitutes a sister species. Here we investigated whether it might utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor. Knowledge of the receptor is highly critical because the restriction of the SARS receptor to deep compartments of the human respiratory tract limited the spread of SARS. In baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, lentiviral transduction of human ACE2 (hACE2) conferred permissiveness and replication for SARS-CoV but not for hCoV-EMC. Monkey and human kidney cells (LLC-MK2, Vero, and 769-P) and swine kidney cells were permissive for both viruses, but only SARS-CoV infection could be blocked by anti-hACE2 antibody and could be neutralized by preincubation of virus with soluble ACE2. Our data show that ACE2 is neither necessary nor sufficient for hCoV-EMC replication. Moreover, hCoV-EMC, but not SARS-CoV, replicated in cell lines from Rousettus, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Myotis, and Carollia bats, representing four major chiropteran families from both suborders. As human CoV normally cannot replicate in bat cells from different families, this suggests that hCoV-EMC might use a receptor molecule that is conserved in bats, pigs, and humans, implicating a low barrier against cross-host transmission.","publish_time":"2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Raj, V.

In recent years, the selective manipulation of specific costimulatory pathways, which are critical in regulating T-cell-mediated immune responses, has generated increasing interest. Impressive results in animal models have shown that the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member OX40 (CD134) and its binding partner OX40L (CD252) are key costimulatory molecules involved in the generation of protective CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses at mucosal surfaces such as the lung.

The impact of respiratory co-infection in SOTR with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is unknown. A multicentre prospective study of consecutive cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in SOTR was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and outcome and the risk factors for co-infection. Overall, 51 patients were included. Median time from transplant was 3.7 years, 5.9% of the cases occurred perioperatively and 7.8% were hospitalacquired. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 15 (29.4%) patients. Ten cases were severe (19.6%): 13.7% were admitted to intensive care units, 5.9% suffered septic shock, 5.9% developed acute graft rejection and 7.8% died. Co-infection was detected in 15 patients (29.4%): eight viral, six bacterial and one fungal. Viral co-infection did not affect the outcome. Patients with non-viral co-infection had a worse outcome: longer hospital stay (26.2 \u00B1 20.7 vs. 5.5 \u00B1 10.2) and higher rate of severe diseases (85.7% vs. 2.3%) and mortality (42.8% vs. 2.3%). Independent risk factors for non-viral co-infection were: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. Other factors associated with severe influenza were: delayed antiviral therapy, diabetes mellitus, time since transplantation \u003C90 days and pneumonia. In conclusion, pandemic influenza A can cause significant direct and indirect effects in SOTR, especially in the early post-transplant period, and should be treated early. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of non-viral co-infection, mainly in diabetic patients and severe cases. An effort should be made to prevent influenza with immunization of the patient and the environment.","publish_time":"2014-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cordero, E.; P\u00E9rez-Romero, P.; Moreno, A.; Len, O.; Montejo, M.; Vidal, E.; Mart\u00EDn-D\u00E1vila, P.; Fari\u00F1as, M.C.; Fern\u00E1ndez-Sab\u00E9, N.; Giannella, M.; Pach\u00F3n, J.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a847b26918e0bc871bfe111e64ebc819d37402ac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f06464ad85213734221855266c44ab624153f056.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129435.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21790857/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03537.x; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X1462704X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X1462704X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe influenza","possibility of non-viral co-infection","SOTR","impact of respiratory co-infection","severe cases","diabetic patients","multicentre prospective study of consecutive cases of pandemic influenza","risk of serious influenza-related complications","Independent risk factors","diabetes mellitus","worse outcome","septic shock","H1N1","Pneumonia","higher rate of severe diseases","early post-transplant period","Median time","Solid organ transplant recipients","delayed antiviral therapy","transplantation","indirect effects","years","longer hospital","clinical characteristics","acute graft rejection","intensive care units","days","immunization","environment","Clinicians","conclusion","effort","mortality"],"language":"en"},

These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire\u0027s disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire\u0027s disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae my exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (~15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to \u03B2-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, B.

Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy.

They can be involved not only in RNA/RNA interactions but also in binding of viral and cellular proteins during the complex processes of translation, RNA replication and encapsidation. Most viral cis-acting RNA elements are located in the highly structured 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-nontranslated regions of the genomes but sometimes they also extend into the adjacent coding sequences. In addition, some cis-acting RNA elements are embedded within the coding sequences far away from the genomic ends. Although the functional importance of many of these structures have been confirmed by genetic and biochemical analyses their precise roles are not yet fully understood.

Wild birds are an important case in point, as other than influenza A virus, avian samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA-sequencing (\u2018meta-transcriptomics\u2019) we revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of the ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. The viruses identified included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. Additionally, we identified novel virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from Australia\u2019s arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) viral abundance and diversity was higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds, and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations.","publish_time":"2018-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Eden, John-Sebastian; Shi, Mang; Klaassen, Marcel; Hurt, Aeron C.; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Molecular Ecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46420ac910edc252f28834803b3025217dd7bb2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6312746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375075/; https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14918","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["diversity of RNA viruses","influenza","ecology of RNA viruses","viral abundance","virome structure","RNA virus genomes","greatest viral diversity","viral diversity present","Australian wild birds","novel virus species","wild populations","described species","arid Australia","bulk RNA-sequencing","temperate Australia","ecological factors","location","underlying differences","meta-transcriptomics","avian samples","infection status","described gammacoronavirus","Australia\u2019s arid interior","meta-transcriptomic analysis","Recurvirostra novaehollandiae","families Astroviridae","Caliciviridae","dabbling ducks","Anas","presence","Arenaria interpres","waterfowl","Rhabdoviridae","Reoviridae","Anseriformes","lens","Red-necked avocets","Picobirnaviridae","Charadriiformes","shorebird","hosts","point","important case","individuals","extent","Ruddy Turnstones","nature","foundation","absence of overt disease","Picornaviridae","study","day"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to measure aerosol production during multiple patient care activities and to examine the samples for bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Five aerosol characterization instruments were used to measure aerosols during 7 patient care activities: patient bathing, changing bed linens, pouring and flushing liquid waste, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, and nebulized medication administration (NMA). Each procedure was sampled 5 times. An SKC BioSampler was used for pathogen recovery. Bacterial cultures were performed on the sampling solution. Patients on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms were selected for most activity sampling. Any patient undergoing bronchoscopy was eligible. RESULTS: Of 35 sampling episodes, only 2 procedures showed a significant increase in particle concentrations over baseline: NMA and bronchoscopy with NMA. Bronchoscopy without NMA and noninvasive ventilation did not generate significant aerosols. Of 78 cultures from the impinger samples, 6 of 28 baseline samples (21.4%) and 14 of 50 procedure samples (28.0%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, significant aerosol generation was only observed during NMA, both alone and during bronchoscopy. Minimal viable bacteria were recovered, mostly common environmental organisms. Although more research is needed, these data suggest that some of the procedures considered to be aerosol-generating may pose little infection risk to HCP.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Neil, Caroline A; Li, Jiayu; Leavey, Anna; Wang, Yang; Hink, Matthew; Wallace, Meghan; Biswas, Pratim; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Babcock, Hilary M","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f16165ab2a0b5c0a34201ddcea547190897dd78d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6248660.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017249/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/65/8/1342/20415990/cix535.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMA","HCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NMA","bronchoscopy","significant aerosols","multiple patient care activities","routine patient care activities","patient bathing","baseline samples","procedure samples","significant aerosol generation","aerosol production","impinger samples","noninvasive ventilation","significant increase","aerosol characterization instruments","viable pathogens","HCP","procedures","study","sampling episodes","activity sampling","bacterial pathogens","sampling solution","Bacterial cultures","drug-resistant organisms","common environmental organisms","Minimal viable bacteria","particle concentrations","liquid waste","nebulized medication administration","contact precautions","bed linens","healthcare personnel","little infection risk","SKC BioSampler","pathogen recovery","Patients","degree","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Questions","data","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","research","times","objective"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of three PPE ensembles, namely, Hospital Authority (HA) Standard Ebola PPE set (PPE1), Dupont Tyvek Model, style 1422A (PPE2), and HA isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol-generating procedures (PPE3) to prevent EVD transmission by measuring the degree of contamination of HCWs and the environment. METHODS: A total of 59 participants randomly performed PPE donning and doffing. The trial consisted of PPE donning, applying fluorescent solution on the PPE surface, PPE doffing of participants, and estimation of the degree of contamination as indicated by the number of fluorescent stains on the working clothes and environment. Protocol deviations during PPE donning and doffing were monitored. RESULTS: PPE2 and PPE3 presented higher contamination risks than PPE1. Environmental contaminations such as those originating from rubbish bin covers, chairs, faucets, and sinks were detected. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing, with PPE1 presenting the lowest overall deviation rate (%) among the three PPE ensembles (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: Contamination of the subjects\u2019 working clothes and surrounding environment occurred frequently during PPE doffing. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing. Although PPE1 presented a lower contamination risk than PPE2 and PPE3 during doffing and protocol deviations, the design of PPE1 can still be further improved. Future directions should focus on designing a high-coverage-area PPE with simple ergonomic features and on evaluating the doffing procedure to minimise the risk of recontamination. Regular training for users should be emphasised to minimise protocol deviations, and in turn, guarantee the best protection to HCWs.

At 4 days post HCMV infection, a total of 169,008,624 sequence reads and 180,616 transcripts were obtained, respectively. Of these transcripts, 1,354 noncoding genes and 12,952 protein-coding genes were observed in Refseq database. Differential gene expression analysis identified 2,153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCMV-infected and mock-infected THP-1 cells, including 1,098 up-regulated genes and 1,055 down-regulated genes. These regulated genes were involved in pathways of apoptosis, inflammatory response and cell cycle progression, all of which may be implicated in viral pathogenesis. In addition, 646 lncRNAs (208 known lncRNAs and 438 novel lncRNAs) were upregulated and 424 (140 known and 284 novel) were downregulated in infected THP-1 cells. These findings have provided a dynamic scenario of DE candidate genes and lncRNAs at the virus-host interface and clearly warrant further experimental investigation associated with HCMV infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qi; Lai, Mei-Mei; Lou, Yun-Yan; Guo, Bin-Han; Wang, Hui-Yan; Zheng, Xiao-Qun","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e6543cc74f6f380858aebdc46f33766749c1315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126988.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111916307302; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623506/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111916307302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","DE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated genes","HCMV-infected","noncoding genes","candidate genes","known lncRNAs","novel lncRNAs","protein-coding genes","HCMV latent infection","cells","mock-infected THP","infected newborns","days post HCMV infection","transcripts","virus-host interface","host-virus interaction","noncoding RNAs","expression of mRNAs","Differential gene expression analysis","inflammatory response","pathways of apoptosis","transcriptional changes","life-threatening disease","total","cell cycle progression","dynamic scenario","experimental investigation","emerging RNA-seq","molecular mechanisms","cause of severe","Abstract Human cytomegalovirus","Refseq database","sequence","DEGs","immunocompromised individuals","findings","addition","viral pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: All patients admitted to one of 206 participating ICUs during two study weeks, one in November 2013 and the other in January 2014, were screened. SARI was defined as possible, probable, or microbiologically confirmed respiratory tract infection with recent onset dyspnea and/or fever. The primary outcome parameter was in-hospital mortality within 60 days of admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Among the 5550 patients admitted during the study periods, 663 (11.9 %) had SARI. On admission to the ICU, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were found in 29.6 and 26.2 % of SARI patients but rarely atypical bacteria (1.0 %); viruses were present in 7.7 % of patients. Organ failure occurred in 74.7 % of patients in the ICU, mostly respiratory (53.8 %), cardiovascular (44.5 %), and renal (44.6 %). ICU and in-hospital mortality rates in patients with SARI were 20.2 and 27.2 %, respectively. In multivariable analysis, older age, greater severity scores at ICU admission, and hematologic malignancy or liver disease were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death, whereas influenza vaccination prior to ICU admission and adequate antibiotic administration on ICU admission were associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: Admission to the ICU for SARI is common and associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We identified several risk factors for in-hospital death that may be useful for risk stratification in these patients.

On one hand, one of the first protective barriers set up to prevent viral replication, spread or persistence involves the induction of apoptotic cell death that aims to limit the availability of the cellular components for viral amplification. On the other hand, while they completely depend on the host molecular machinery, viruses also need to evade the cellular responses that are meant to destroy them. The existence of numerous antiapoptotic products within the viral kingdom proves that apoptosis constitutes a major threat that should better be bypassed. Among the different strategies developed to deal with apoptosis, one is based on what viruses do best: backfiring the cell on itself. Several unrelated viruses have been described to take advantage of apoptosis induction by expressing proteins targeted by caspases, the key effectors of apoptotic cell death. Caspase cleavage of these proteins results in various consequences, from logical apoptosis inhibition to more surprising enhancement or attenuation of viral replication.

Research findings indicate that PDCoV has evolved strategies to escape innate immune response in host cells, but mechanism of PDCoV in innate immune modulation is not well understood. In this study, we report our findings on identifying the alterations of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection and exploring the gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells at 0, 24, and 36 h PDCoV post infection by RNA sequencing. A total of 3,762 and 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparison of uninfected PK-15 cells and infected PK-15 cells at 24 h post infection (hpi) (INF_24h versus NC), and also comparison of infected PK-15 cells between 24 and 36 hpi (INF_36h versus INF_24h), which included 156 and 23 porcine innate immune-related genes in the DEGs of INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. Gene Ontology function classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on the DEGs that exhibited the same expression tendencies with most of the innate immune-associated genes among these PK-15 cell samples described above. The enrichment results indicated that extensive gene functions and signaling pathways including innate immune-associated functions and pathways were affected by PDCoV infection. Particularly, 4 of 5 innate immune signaling pathways, which were primarily affected by PDCoV, played important roles in I-IFN\u2019s antiviral function in innate immune response. Additionally, 16 of the host cell endogenous miRNAs were predicted as potential contributors to the modulation of innate immune response affected by PDCoV. Our research findings indicated that the innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways in PK-15 cells could be modified by the infection of PDCoV, which provides a fundamental foundation for further studies to better understand the mechanism of PDCoV infections, so as to effectively control and prevent PDCoV-induced swine diarrheal disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Shan; Li, Fuqiang; Li, Xiuli; Wang, Lili; Zhang, Li; Lu, Chao; Zheng, Li; Yan, Minghua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25d0bd17e76d262df4c2948ef2d8a5270f00871a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6773216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574122/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of PDCoV","innate immune modulation","innate immune-associated genes","modulation of innate immune response","h PDCoV post infection","innate immune-associated functions","porcine innate immune-related genes","h post infection","mechanism of PDCoV infections","host cells","DEGs of INF","pathways","comparison of infected PK","gene expression profiles of PK","comparison of uninfected PK","PDCoV-induced swine diarrheal disease outbreaks","Research findings","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","alterations of host cell","extensive gene functions","host cell endogenous miRNAs","hpi","cell samples","Gene Ontology function classification","expression tendencies","enrichment results","Porcine deltacoronavirus","IFN\u2019s antiviral function","pathway enrichment analysis","emerged swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","pigs","Genomes","potential contributors","ages","RNA sequencing","strategies","important roles","studies","fundamental foundation","diarrhea problems","study","total"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses (CoV) and their possible effects on brain structural and functional integrity. It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms. This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks. Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients. It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogier, Michael; And\u00E9ol, Guillaume; Sagui, Emmanuel; Bo, Gregory Dal","journal":"Brain, behavior, \u0026 immunity health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e073cfaec8d63af13c79481fec9ef9e6091dd2bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620300466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427134/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620300466?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","homologous CoV","neurologic sequelae of COVID","recovered COVID","neurologic manifestations of COVID","dysfunctional following SARS-CoV","brain structural","brain parenchyma","recovered patients","progressive brain damage","possible improvements","possible effects","current reports","current knowledge","current evidence","neurologic symptoms","possible etiology","analyses of previous CoV outbreaks","long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae","brain cell degeneration","progressive demyelination","current medical care procedures","brainstem integrity","demyelination similar","functional integrity","signs of MS","available data","thorough review","intensive care units","severe hypoxia","neuroimaging features","hypoxemia","heightened inflammation","chronic neuroinflammation","scientific literature","evaluation","multiple sclerosis","respiratory difficulties","neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses","overview","dissemination","cerebral area","long term","sensorimotor dysfunctions","psychiatric disorders","thalamic functions","Viral invasion"],"language":"en"},

The causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the Pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA and PCR assays. These diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel. RESULTS: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of Y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth (ERM) disease in salmonids. The assay was optimised to amplify the yruI/yruR gene, which encodes Y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, in the presence of a specific primer set and Bst DNA polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63\u00B0C for one hour. Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with HphI restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish. CONCLUSION: The ERM-LAMP assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Y. ruckeri in fish farms. The assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as laboratory furniture. The advantages of the ERM-LAMP assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms.","publish_time":"2008-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saleh, Mona; Soliman, Hatem; El-Matbouli, Mansour","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b890aa8cb8a15fec0f4bb8e970f5a21fd2dfda33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2531098.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18700011/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-4-31","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Enteric Redmouth"],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ERM-LAMP assay","specific detection of","contagious disease","molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease","causative agent","isothermal amplification","fish farms","etiological agent of enteric red mouth","Enteric Redmouth","gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri","ruckeri quorum sensing system","formation of LAMP amplicons","absence of amplification products","salmonids","hour","specific primer","isothermal temperature","PCR assays","conventional PCR","tissue homogenates of infected fish","agarose gel electrophoresis","fluorescent antibody tests","promising tool","time consuming","real-time monitoring of turbidity","ELISA","Bst DNA polymerase","visual inspection","Pathogen","practical alternative","microbiological approach","heating block","water bath","presence","HphI restriction enzyme","Yersiniosis","pure bacterial culture","amplified product","laboratory furniture","diagnostic methods","higher sensitivity","loop","isolation","yruR gene","Digestion","trained personnel","yruI","related bacteria","identification","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","advantages","RESULTS","trout","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Further, structural analysis by X-ray crystallography indicated each catalytic reaction is arranged as a discrete domain, including a nucleoside-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O MTase). In this study, we have exploited the structural information to identify the residues that are important for the catalytic activity of 2\u2032-O MTase of VP4 and their influence on BTV replication. The effect of these mutations on GMP binding, guanylyltransferase (GTase) and methylase activities were analysed by a series of in vitro biochemical assays using recombinant mutant proteins; subsequently their effects on virus replication were assessed by introducing the same mutations in replicating viral genome using a reverse genetics system. Our data showed that single substitution mutations in the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E were sufficient to abolish 2\u2032-O MTase activity in vitro and to completely abrogate BTV replication in cells; although these mutants retained the upstream GMP binding, GTase and guanine-N7-methyltransferase activities. Mutations of the surrounding substrate-binding pocket (predicted to recruit cap0) had variable effects on in vitro VP4 capping activity. Only triple but not single substitution mutations of these residues in genome resulted in reduced virus replication kinetics. This is the first report investigating the importance of 2\u2032-O MTase function for any member of the Reoviridae and highlights the significance of K-D-K-E tetrad and surrounding residues for the efficiency of 2\u2032-O MTase activity and in turn, for virus fitness.","publish_time":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stewart, Meredith E.; Roy, Polly","journal":"FEBS Open Bio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/019760388ec5fa9151add6cfe32178deda5433eb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7fedd1176b41cfd4cc01538305f91439304abee7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4359970.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221154631500011X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25834778/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221154631500011X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fob.2015.02.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["X-ray"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O MTase activity","O MTase of VP4","O-methyltransferase","O MTase function","catalytic activity","BTV replication","single substitution mutations","VP4 capping activity","catalytic tetrad","surrounding residues","reduced virus replication kinetics","virus fitness","Bluetongue virus","GTase","viral genome","upstream GMP binding","catalytic reaction","single capping protein","E tetrad","methyltransferase activities","surrounding substrate-binding pocket","variable effects","methylase activities","structural analysis","structural information","nascent viral transcripts","guanine-N7","guanylyltransferase","recombinant mutant proteins","biochemical assays","cap1 structures","series of","X-ray crystallography","mutants","efficiency","turn","influence","reverse genetics system","cap0","member","discrete domain","Reoviridae","reactions","nucleoside","cells","importance","data","significance","report","study"],"language":"en"},

Migration of the parasites can be accompanied by neuromotor disorders or paralysis in natural definitive hosts (ducks) and even in laboratory mammals. Cercariae are also able to penetrate human skin and induce cercarial dermatitis. While the cellular and antibody responses against cercariae and migrating schistosomula have been investigated in mice, little is known about immune reactions in birds. This study first describes the dynamics of antibody response in infected ducks and identifies frequently recognized antigens that may serve as diagnostic markers of infection by T. regenti. METHODS: Groups of 35 domestic ducks and 10 mallards were exposed to different doses of T. regenti cercariae. Sera were collected at predefined time intervals and tested by ELISA for the presence of specific anti-cercarial IgY and IgM. Antigens recognized by the antibodies were identified on Western blots of cercariae and schistosomula. The applicability in immunodiagnostics was statistically evaluated by expression of specificity and sensitivity values for individual antigens. RESULTS: In ELISA, the levels of anti-cercarial IgM peaked on day 15 pi. Increased production of IgY associated with the later phases of infection was observed in most individuals around 20 dpi and culminated 30 dpi. The time course of antibody response did not differ among experimental groups, variations were only observed in the levels of specific IgY which depended rather on the age of ducks at the time of infection than on the infectious dose. On Western blots, 40 cercarial and 7 schistosomular antigens were recognized by IgY from infected ducks. Among them, 4 cercarial antigens of 50, 47, 32 and 19 kDa provided the most sensitive and specific reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Antigens of cercariae and schistosomula elicited distinct antibody response in ducks, which correlated positively with the age of animals at the time of infection. Several antigens originating in cercariae and fewer in schistosomula were recognized by IgY with diverse sensitivity and specificity; only a few seemed to be common to both stages. Four of them were considered as the most promising candidates for immunodiagnostics.

Many of these deadly viruses require biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment for all laboratory work, which limits traditional laboratory high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of small molecule inhibitors. For those reasons, a related BSL-2 New World arenavirus, Tacaribe virus, 67\u201378% identical to Jun\u00EDn virus at the amino acid level, was used in a HTS campaign where approximately 400,000 small molecule compounds were screened in a Tacaribe virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Compounds identified in this screen showed antiviral activity and specificity against not only Tacaribe virus, but also the Category A New World arenaviruses (Jun\u00EDn, Machupo, and Guanarito). Drug resistant variants were isolated, suggesting that these compounds act through inhibition of a viral protein, the viral glycoprotein (GP2), and not through cellular toxicity mechanisms. A lead compound, ST-294, has been chosen for drug development. This potent and selective compound, with good bioavailability, demonstrated protective anti-viral efficacy in a Tacaribe mouse challenge model.

Twenty-one amino acid differences were observed in the polyprotein 1a/ab between the different passages.

Here we propose a computational method, Conformational Epitope (CE)-BLAST, for calculating the antigenic similarity among different pathogens with stable and high performance, which is independent of the prior binding-assay information, unlike the currently available models that heavily rely on the historical experimental data. Tool validation incorporates influenza-related experimental data sufficient for stability and reliability determination. Application to dengue-related data demonstrates high harmonization between the computed clusters and the experimental serological data, undetectable by classical grouping. CE-BLAST identifies the potential cross-reactive epitope between the recent zika pathogen and the dengue virus, precisely corroborated by experimental data. The high performance of the pathogens without the experimental binding data suggests the potential utility of CE-BLAST to rapidly design cross-protective vaccines or promptly determine the efficacy of the currently marketed vaccine against emerging pathogens, which are the critical factors for containing emerging disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Tianyi; Yang, Yiyan; Qiu, Jingxuan; Huang, Yang; Xu, Tianlei; Xiao, Han; Wu, Dingfeng; Zhang, Qingchen; Zhou, Chen; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Tang, Kailin; Xu, Jianqing; Cao, Zhiwei","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da3dea36182741e1b3699e372f16e1f0bb2fd315.json; document_parses/pdf_json/99b91c8b0a5455bca54167c5abb7c0dfdbf032c6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0eda9491295d6a851db35c358ac0c4fe956dce1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5932059.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04171-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29720583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conformational Epitope"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental binding data","experimental serological data","historical experimental data","emerging pathogens","dengue-related data","different pathogens","influenza-related experimental data sufficient","CE-BLAST","high performance","inter-subtypic pathogens","potential utility of CE","high harmonization","emerging varieties","potential cross-reactive epitope","cross-protective immunity","cross-protective vaccines","emerging disease outbreaks","Conformational Epitope","dengue virus","vaccine development","marketed vaccine","prior binding-assay information","recent zika pathogen","computed clusters","stability","critical factors","antigenic similarity","classical grouping","reliability determination","Tool validation","efficacy","immunogens","computational method","available models","Major challenges","Application"],"language":"en"},

G6PD-deficient cells have a reduced ability to induce the innate immune response, thus increasing host susceptibility to pathogen infections. An important part of the immune response is the activation of the inflammasome. G6PD-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and human monocytic (THP-1) cells were used as models to investigate whether G6PD modulates inflammasome activation. A decreased expression of IL-1\u03B2 was observed in both G6PD-deficient PBMCs and PMA-primed G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) THP-1 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or LPS/nigericin stimulation. The pro-IL-1\u03B2 expression of THP-1 cells was decreased by G6PD knockdown at the transcriptional and translational levels in an investigation of the expression of the inflammasome subunits. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream c-Fos expression were decreased upon G6PD knockdown, accompanied by decreased AP-1 translocation into the nucleus. Impaired inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells was mediated by a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NOX signaling, while treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) enhanced inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells. G6PD knockdown decreased Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli clearance in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells and G6PD-deficient PBMCs following inflammasome activation. These findings support the notion that enhanced pathogen susceptibility in G6PD deficiency is, in part, due to an altered redox signaling, which adversely affects inflammasome activation and the bactericidal response.","publish_time":"2019-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, Wei-Chen; Wu, Yi-Hsuan; Wu, Chih-Ching; Lin, Hsin-Ru; Stern, Arnold; Chen, Shih-Hsiang; Shu, Jwu-Ching; Tsun-Yee Chiu, Daniel","journal":"Redox Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/264fb27c70d421557131f4ec462c56c8378217ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6854078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NADPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G6PD-deficient cells","G6PD-kd THP","G6PD deficiency","G6PD-deficient PBMCs","PMA-primed G6PD-knockdown","G6PD knockdown decreased Staphylococcus aureus","G6PD-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Impaired inflammasome activation","\u03B2 expression of THP","inflammasome subunits","decreased expression of IL","LPS","innate immune response","pathogen susceptibility","bactericidal response","downstream c-Fos expression","host susceptibility","phosphate dehydrogenase","pathogen infections","pro-IL","cellular redox homeostasis","pentose phosphate pathway","Escherichia coli clearance","ATP","patients","reduced ability","production of reactive oxygen species","NOX","ROS","phosphorylation of p38 MAPK","adenosine triphosphate","translational levels","investigation","lipopolysaccharide","human monocytic","hydrogen peroxide","treatment","enzyme","rate","notion","regeneration of NADPH","nigericin stimulation","models","translocation","nucleus","findings","Glucose"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress and mitochondrial function by Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of intramuscular fat metabolism. We investigated the effects of ACE2 on ER stress and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. METHODS: The triglyceride (TG) content in skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of lipogenic genes (ACC\u03B1, SREBP-1c, LXR\u03B1, CPT-1\u03B1, PGC-1\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B1), ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes (GRP78, eIF2\u03B1, ATF4, BCL-2, and SDH6) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Lipid metabolism, ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes were analyzed by RT-PCR in ACE2-overexpression C2C12 cell. Moreover, the IKK\u03B2/NF\u03BAB/IRS-1 pathway was determined using lysate sample from skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice. RESULTS: ACE2 deficiency in vivo is associated with increased lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle. The ACE2 knockout mice displayed an elevated level of ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress and mitochondrial function, which slightly accompanied by reduced TG content and down-regulated the expression of skeletal muscle lipogenic proteins in the db/db mice. Additionally, ACE2 improved skeletal muscle lipid metabolism and ER stress genes in the C2C12 cells. Mechanistically, endogenous ACE2 improved lipid metabolism through the IKK\u03B2/NF\u03BAB/IRS-1 pathway in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was first reported to play a notable role on intramuscular fat regulation by improving endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial function. This study may provide a strategy for treating insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Xi; Lu, Xin-Meng; Tuo, Xiu; Liu, Jing-Yi; Zhang, Yi-Chen; Song, Li-Ni; Cheng, Zhi-Qiang; Yang, Jin-Kui; Xin, Zhong","journal":"Lipids Health Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f638f6e2c3362136ed83e0bfe30acaf78e7c9fb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6882339.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Endoplasmic"],"organizations":["TG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice","skeletal muscle lipid metabolism","ER stress genes","Ad-ACE2","ACE2 deficiency","activation of ACE2","effects of ACE2","regulation of ER stress","mitochondrial function related genes","endogenous ACE2 improved lipid metabolism","expression of skeletal muscle lipogenic proteins","elevated level of ER stress","mitochondrial dysfunctions","db mice","ACE2-overexpression C2C12 cell","prevention of intramuscular fat metabolism","expression of lipogenic genes","intramuscular fat regulation","increased lipid accumulation","intramuscular fat accumulation","treated db","Endoplasmic reticulum","pathway","NF\u03BAB","IRS","IKK\u03B2","RT-PCR","reduced TG content","C2C12 cells","GRP78","eIF2\u03B1","Angiotensin","lysate sample","SREBP","ACC\u03B1","PPAR\u03B1","BCL","CPT","LXR\u03B1","PGC","ATF4","strategy","notable role","triglyceride","insulin resistance","enzyme","assay kits","OBJECTIVE","SDH6","METHODS","RESULTS","contrast","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Then, we validated the researcher-made tool by face validity, content validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and criterion validity. Data were collected by sending the tool to 620 CBHOs serving under supervision of Iran\u2019s ministry of health. Opinions of health professionals and stakeholders in CBHOs were used to assess face and content validity. Factor loads in EFA were based on three-factor structure that verified by CFA. We used SPSS V.18 and Mplus7 software for statistical analysis. About 105 health-based CBHOs participated. After conducting face validity and calculating content validity ratio and content validity index, we reached 54 items in the field of planning, training and infrastructure. We conducted construct validity using 105 CBHOs. Three items exchanged between the fields according to factor loads in EFA, and CFA verified the model fit as Comparative Fit Index, Tucker-Lewis index and root mean square error of approximation were 0.921, 0918 and 0.052, respectively. The Cronbach\u2019s of the whole tool was 0.944. Spearman correlation coefficient confirmed criterion validity as coefficient was 0.736. Planning, training and infrastructure fields are the most important aspects of preparedness in health-based CBHOs.

Along with Ufd1, Npl4 forms a heterodimer (UN), and functions as a cofactor for the Cdc48 ATPase. Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4-binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively. Mutational analysis suggests that the CTD contributes to linkage selectivity and initial binding of ubiquitin chains. Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme.

Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species\u2019 ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species\u2019 ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s. These findings provide a foundation to further develop research methods to trace nairovirus-host relationships and delineate the full impact of ISG15 diversity on nairovirus infection.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dzimianski, John V.; Scholte, Florine E.

There are mainly two types of influenza viruses\u2014influenza A and B with several subtypes\u2014that are commonly found to circulate among humans. The traditional trivalent (TIV) flu vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. The quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine targets one extra B virus strain that ensures better protection against influenza; however, the use of QIV vaccine can be costly, hence impose an extra financial burden to society. This scenario might create a dilemma in choosing vaccine types at the individual level. This article endeavours to explain such a dilemma through the framework of a vaccination game, where individuals can opt for one of the three options: choose either of QIV or TIV vaccine or none. Our approach presumes a mean-field framework of a vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, entangling the disease spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccination decision-making processes taking place before an epidemic season. We conduct a series of numerical simulations as an attempt to illustrate different scenarios. The framework has been validated by the so-called multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arefin, Md. Rajib; Masaki, Tanaka; Kabir, K. M.

Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a milieu-therapeutic approach that aims to promote the self-efficacy and self-care of youth welfare staff by guiding them to a better understanding of their own and their clients\u2019 stress symptoms and countertransference. Despite increasing efforts to implement TIC practices, and more widespread recognition of their value in youth welfare systems, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of this approach. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TIC practices in youth welfare institutions on both the physiological stress of staff members and clients\u2019 physical aggression towards their caregivers. . METHODS: Data was obtained from a longitudinal study investigating the effectiveness of TIC in 14 residential youth welfare institutions. Our sample consisted of 47 youth welfare employees (66.0% female) aged from 23 to 60 years (M = 37.4, SD = 10.4 years). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and occurrences of client physical aggression were assessed at four annual measurement time points (T1 to T4). RESULTS: Participants in five institutions employing TIC practices (intervention group) showed significantly lower HCC at T4 than staff members from institutions who did not receive training in TIC (control group), indicating reduced physiological stress levels. At T4, the intervention group reported significantly less physical aggression than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: TIC might be a promising approach for reducing the emotional burden of employees and institutions should invest in training their staff in TIC practices. More research is necessary, to investigate the benefits and efficacy of TIC, both to youths and staff members, and to foster a better understanding of which specific factors may contribute to stress reduction.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmid, Marc; L\u00FCdtke, Janine; Dolitzsch, Claudia; Fischer, Sophia; Eckert, Anne; Fegert, J\u00F6rg M.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6947862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of TIC","efficacy of TIC","residential youth welfare institutions","youth welfare employees","effects of TIC practices","self-care of youth welfare staff","youth welfare systems","physiological stress of staff members","intervention group","control group","stress reduction","T4","clients\u2019 physical aggression","clients\u2019 stress symptoms","high levels of stress","reduced physiological stress levels","occurrences of client physical aggression","promising approach","better understanding","training","years","emotional burden of employees","milieu-therapeutic approach","emotional needs","lower HCC","self-efficacy","Professional caregivers","longitudinal study","challenging coping strategies of clients","cumulated traumatic experiences","complex mental health issues","child","annual measurement time points","widespread recognition","T1","specific factors","value","Participants","youths","Hair cortisol concentration","lack of studies","Trauma-informed care","Data","BACKGROUND","countertransference","benefits","sample","female","SD","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","efforts","compassion fatigue","research","METHODS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Pathogenic treponemes is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete pathogen that causes syphilis in human. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) causes endemic syphilis (bejel); T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA) causes venereal syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) causes yaws; and T. pallidum subsp. Ccarateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is mediated by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact. The global distribution of syphilis is alarming and there is an increasing need of proper treatment and preventive measures. Unfortunately, effective measures are limited. RESULTS: Here, the genome sequences of 53 T. pallidum strains isolated from different parts of the world and a diverse range of hosts were comparatively analysed using pan-genomic strategy. Phylogenomic, pan-genomic, core genomic and singleton analysis disclosed the close connection among all strains of the pathogen T. pallidum, its clonal behaviour and showed increases in the sizes of the pan-genome. Based on the genome plasticity analysis of the subsets containing the subspecies T pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, we found differences in the presence/absence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and genomic islands (GIs) on subsp.-based study. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identified four pathogenicity islands (PAIs), eight genomic islands (GIs) in subsp. pallidum, whereas subsp. endemicum has three PAIs and seven GIs and subsp. pertenue harbours three PAIs and eight GIs. Concerning the presence of genes in PAIs and GIs, we found some genes related to lipid and amino acid biosynthesis that were only present in the subsp. of T. pallidum, compared to T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaiswal, Arun Kumar; Tiwari, Sandeep; Jamal, Syed Babar; de Castro Oliveira, Let\u00EDcia; Alves, Leandro Gomes; Azevedo, Vasco; Ghosh, Preetam; Oliveira, Carlo Jose Freira; Soares, Siomar C.","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c068f4973ed86ac76e96b0087cbb9c3b31a92cbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6953169.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6953169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Treponematoses"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pallidum strains","Treponema pallidum","subspecies T pallidum","GIs","PAIs","genomic islands","endemicum","venereal syphilis","core genomic","endemic syphilis","pan-genomic strategy","pan-genome","pertenue harbours","absence of pathogenicity islands","global distribution of syphilis","genome plasticity analysis","presence of genes","genome sequences","close personal contact","singleton analysis","spirochete pathogen","Treponema genus","close connection","sexual contact","preventive measures","effective measures","based study","high morbidity diseases","subsets","increasing need of proper treatment","world","amino acid biosynthesis","Spirochetal organisms","clonal behaviour","different parts","lipid","increases","sizes","yaws","differences","diverse range of hosts","bejel","TPA","Pathogenic treponemes","BACKGROUND","Treponematoses","summary","Ccarateum","human","Phylogenomic","TPE","RESULTS","pinta","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, the clinical significance remains poorly defined. We investigated whether patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia not responding to antibiotics and in whom high levels of HSV could be detected in respiratory secretions benefit from acyclovir treatment. METHODS: Respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirates) were tested for HSV replication by quantitative real-time PCR. ICU survival times, clinical parameters, and radiographic findings were retrospectively compared between untreated and acyclovir treated patients with high (\u003E 10(5) HSV copies/mL) and low (10(3)\u201310(5) HSV copies/mL) viral load. RESULTS: Fifty-seven low and 69 high viral load patients were identified. Fewer patients with high viral load responded to antibiotic treatment (12% compared to 40% of low load patients, p = 0.001). Acyclovir improved median ICU survival (8 vs 22 days, p = 0.014) and was associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for ICU death (HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.11\u20130.92, p = 0.035) in high load patients only. Moreover, circulatory and pulmonary oxygenation function of high load patients improved significantly over the course of acyclovir treatment: mean norepinephrine doses decreased from 0.05 to 0.02 \u03BCg/kg body weight/min between days 0 and 6 of treatment (p = 0.049), and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased from 187 to 241 between day 3 and day 7 of treatment (p = 0.02). Chest radiographic findings also improved significantly (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, antibiotic treatment failure, and high levels of HSV replication, acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly longer time to death in the ICU and improved circulatory and pulmonary function. This suggests a causative role for HSV in this highly selected group of patients.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schuierer, Lukas; Gebhard, Michael; Ruf, Hans-Georg; Jaschinski, Ulrich; Berghaus, Thomas M.; Wittmann, Michael; Braun, Georg; Busch, Dirk H.; Hoffmann, Reinhard","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8501f2f763491642d7bd6e267facb6636f31d8ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high viral load patients","low load patients","Fewer patients","high levels of HSV replication","pulmonary oxygenation function of high load patients","HSV copies","course of acyclovir treatment","selected group of patients","ICU death","antibiotic treatment failure","median ICU survival","respiratory secretions","ICU survival times","ventilator-associated pneumonia","high proportion of ventilated intensive care unit","pulmonary function","days","Chest radiographic findings","clinical parameters","clinical significance","median PaO","reduced hazard ratio","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","tracheal aspirates","Herpes simplex virus","mean norepinephrine doses","vs","BACKGROUND","METHODS","quantitative real-time PCR","antibiotics","longer time","\u03BCg","body weight","FiO","causative role","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The study aim was to investigate current SHI coverage and patients\u2019 perspectives on this transition. METHODS: A survey of 1348 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (aged \u226518 years) was conducted at an HIV outpatient clinic at a central-level hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October and November 2018. Insurance coverage, reasons for not having a SHI card, perceived concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered local health facilities, and willingness to continue regularly visiting the current hospital were self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze factors associated with not having a SHI card and having concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered hospitals/clinics. RESULTS: SHI coverage was 78.0%. The most frequently reported reason for not having a SHI card was that obtaining one was burdensome, followed by lack of information on how to obtain a card, and financial problems. Most patients (86.6%) had concerns about receiving HIV services at SHI-registered local health facilities, and disclosure of HIV status to neighbors and low quality of HIV services were the main concerns reported. Participants aged \u003C 40 years old and unmarried were more likely to report lack of SHI cards, and women and those aged \u226540 years were more likely to have concerns. However, 91.4% of patients showed willingness to continue regular visits to the current hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Although SHI coverage has been rapidly improving among HIV patients, most participants had concerns about the current system transition in Vietnam. In response to their voiced concerns, strengthening the link between higher-level and lower-level facilities may help to ensure good quality HIV services at all levels while mitigating patients\u2019 worries and anxieties.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsumoto, Shoko; Nguyen, Hoai Dung Thi; Nguyen, Dung Thi; Van Tran, Giang; Tanuma, Junko; Mizushima, Daisuke; Van Nguyen, Kinh; Oka, Shinichi","journal":"BMC Int Health Hum Rights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d933440ebabd5b2625d7da6628ec1951cb94e55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV","SHI"],"locations":["Vietnam","Hanoi"],"keyphrases":["HIV patients","current SHI coverage","HIV-positive patients","good quality HIV services","low quality of HIV services","SHI-registered hospitals","lack of SHI cards","SHI-registered local health facilities","disclosure of HIV status","HIV outpatient clinic","HIV service delivery system","perceived concerns","main concerns","voiced concerns","current hospital","current system transition","Insurance coverage","Vietnam","public health system","social health insurance","lower-level facilities","central-level hospital","years old","willingness","Participants","reported reason","patients\u2019 perspectives","patients\u2019 worries","lack of information","levels","antiretroviral therapy","link","regular visits","women","Hanoi","survey","reasons","study aim","anxieties","factors","clinics","Logistic regression analyses","financial problems","response","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for randomized controlled trials comparing NMBAs to any other comparator. We pooled data using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane tool and levels of evidence using the GRADE method. RESULTS: Finally, six RCTs (n = 1557 patients) were eligible for analysis. The results showed NMBAs use was not associated with reduced 28 days mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.06; P = 0.11), 90 days mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.04; P = 0.16), and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.03; P = 0.13) in patients with ARDS. However, 21\u201328 days mortality was slightly lower in patients received NMBAs (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04; I(2) = 53%). Besides, NMBAs use could improve the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at 48 and 72 h, decrease plateau pressure and PEEP at 72 h. Additionally, NMBAs had no significant effects on days free of ventilation at day 28 (WMD, 0.55; 95% CI, \u2212 0.46 to 1.57; P = 0.29), days not in ICU at day 28 (WMD, 0.12; 95% CI, \u2212 0.85 to 1.08; P = 0.82), ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.93; P = 0.06). Finally, NMBAs use was associated with a lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory distress syndrome, NMBAs may be beneficial in reverse refractory hypoxemia and may be associated with reduced short-term mortality and incidence of barotrauma.

The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent. Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gines; Nogales, Aitor; Park, Jun-Gyu; Vasquez, Desarey Morales; Dean, David A.; Barravecchia, Michael; Perez, Daniel R.; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/185e505daa1da8ee7ece18212693b2550410a190.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6965646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Americas","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV viremia","biology of ZIKV","infectious ZIKV cDNA clone","significant impact of ZIKV","recent ZIKV outbreaks","lethal ZIKV challenge","rZIKV cDNA","sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba","attenuated rZIKV","infectious rZIKV","live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated","type","reverse genetics method","study of wild","interferon receptor deficient A129 mice","reverse genetic approaches","single intraperitoneal inoculation","commercial transfection reagent","absence of transfection reagent","direct delivery","human health","public health officials","suitable delivery platform","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","adults","high alert","different routes","rescue of recombinant","congenital malformations","Caribbean","Americas","control","possibility","generation","systems","bacterial artificial chromosome","mosquito","protection","death","effective prevention options","cytomegalovirus promoter","Clinical signs","decades","mild febrile illness","member","Flaviviridae family","New technologies","Zika virus","results","viruses","passage","way","future","studies"],"language":"en"},

Immunoproteomics analysis of S. agalactiae was used to identify antigenic proteins and construct a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Epitopes from five antigenic proteins were shuffled in five helices of a flavodoxin backbone, and in silico analysis predicted a suitable RNA and protein structure for protein expression. 45F2 and 42E2 were identified as the best candidates for a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to produce a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine system. Overexpressed proteins were determined to be 30 kDa and 25 kDa in the E. coli and TK1 systems, respectively. The efficacy of the chimeric multiepitope construct as a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine was evaluated in Nile tilapia, followed by S. agalactiae challenge at 1 \u00D7 10(7) CFU/mL. Relative percentage survival (RPS) and cumulative mortality were recorded at approximately 57\u201376% and 17\u201330%, respectively.

METHODS: We collected countries\u2019 self-evaluated scores (International Health Regulations Monitoring tool, IHRMT) of 2016 and 2017, and external evaluation scores (Joint External Evaluation, JEE) from WHO website on 4rd and 27rd November, 2018. There were 127 and 163 countries with IHRMT scores in 2016 and in 2017, and 74 countries with JEE scores included in the analysis. The gap between countries\u2019 self-evaluation and external evaluation was represented by the difference between condensed IHR scores and JEE. Civil liberties (CL) scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index (HDI) and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses (HWD) were collected to reflect countries\u2019 development and health workforce statuses. Then, chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine the correlation between the gap of IHRMT and JEE, and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status. RESULTS: Countries\u2019 self-evaluation scores significantly decreased from 2016 to 2017. Countries\u2019 external evaluation scores are consistently 1 to 1.5 lower than self-evaluation scores. There were significantly more countries with high HDI status, high CL status and high HWD status in groups with bigger gap between IHRMT and JEE. And countries with higher HDI status presented a higher risk of having bigger gap between countries\u2019 self and external scores (OR = 3.181). CONCLUSION: Our study result indicated that countries\u2019 transparency represented by CL status do play a role in the gap between IHR and JEE scores. But HDI status is the key factor which significantly associated with the gap. The main reason for the gap in the current world is the different interpretation of evaluation of high HDI countries, though low CL countries tended to over-scored their capacity.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Feng-Jen; Turbat, Battsetseg","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deac4ad6ea3f912b3df389a02dc68f656cbafaaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6972006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health Regulations Monitoring","JEE","IHR","HDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["external scores","JEE scores","Countries\u2019 external evaluation scores","Countries\u2019 self-evaluation scores","IHRMT scores","gap of IHRMT","countries\u2019 development","bigger gap","high HDI status","countries\u2019 self-evaluated scores","high HDI countries","countries\u2019 transparency","higher HDI status","condensed IHR scores","high HWD status","Joint External Evaluation","International Health Regulations","different interpretation of evaluation","health workforce statuses","Human Development Index","Civil liberties","higher risk","study result","core capacity of infectious disease control","groups","difference","data","current world","influence factors","tool","density of physicians","logistic regression","key factor","chi-square test","nurses","METHODS","indicators","correlation","role","RESULTS","main reason","country","CONCLUSION","website","analysis","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

It asks the question, can Public Health advance food security? If so, how, and what are its limitations? METHODS: This policy analysis merges findings from 38 key informant interviews conducted with government and civil society stakeholders involved in the development of food security initiatives, along with an examination of relevant documents. The Population Health Template is used to delineate and analyze Public Health roles in food security. RESULTS: Public Health was able to advance food security in some ways, such as the adoption of food security as a core public health program. Public Health\u2019s leadership role in food security is constrained by a restricted mandate, limited ability to collaborate across a wide range of sectors and levels, as well as internal conflict within Public Health between Food Security and Food Protection programs. CONCLUSIONS: Public Health has a role in advancing food security, but it also faces limitations. As the limitations are primarily systemic and institutional, recommendations to overcome them are not simple but, rather, require movement toward embracing the determinants of health and regulatory pluralism. The results also suggest that the historic role of Public Health in food security remains salient today.","publish_time":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seed, Barbara A.; Lang, Tim M.; Caraher, Martin J.; Ostry, Aleck S.","journal":"Can J Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c830a6fe19b42008078224795d3da167ce248a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health","Population Health Template"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Public Health advance food security","advancing food security","adoption of food security","limitations of Public Health","Public Health roles","development of food security initiatives","integration of food security initiatives","historic role of Public Health","determinants of health","core public health program","Food Protection programs","Population Health Template","Public Health\u2019s leadership role","RESULTS","key informant interviews","British Columbia","policy analysis merges findings","government","civil society stakeholders","internal conflict","levels","limited ability","restricted mandate","wide range of sectors","METHODS","policies","question","recommendations","movement","regulatory pluralism","research","ways","CONCLUSIONS","examination of relevant documents","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Diseases like influenza, enteric fever and rickettsial fevers account for majority of such outbreaks. Optimal diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions are not available at the point-of-care. A proper epidemiological and clinical characterization of such outbreaks is important for appropriate treatment and control efforts. METHODS: An investigation was initiated as a response to increased presentation of patients at Patan Hospital from Chalnakhel locality in Dakchinkali municipality, Kathmandu with AUFI from June 10 to July 1, 2016. Focused group discussion with local inhabitants and the epidemiological curve of febrile patients at local primary health care centre confirmed the outbreak. The household-survey was conducted in the area with questionnaire administered on patients to characterize their illnesses and their medical records were reviewed. A different set of questionnaire was administered on the patients and controls to investigate the association with common risk factors. Water samples were collected and analyzed microbiologically. RESULTS: Eighty one patients from 137 households suffered from febrile illness within 6 weeks window before the investigation. All the 67 sampled patients with acute fever had a generalized illness without a discernible focus of infection. Only 38% of the patients had received a clinical diagnosis while the rest were treated empirically without a diagnosis. Three patients had blood culture confirmed enteric fever. Forty-two (63%) patients had been administered antibiotics, most commonly, ofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin with a mean fever clearance time of 4 days. There was no definite association between several risk factors and fever. Fecal contamination was noted in tap water samples. CONCLUSION: Based on the pattern of illness, this outbreak was most likely a mixture of self-limiting viral infections and enteric fever. This study shows that even in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and the recovery course can suggest the diagnosis and help in formulating appropriate recommendation for treatment and control.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pokharel, Sunil; Karki, Manan; Acharya, Bhim; Marasini, Baburam; Arjyal, Amit","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31caba946fefeb876ff3a07e61b628f79a0b9598.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6993335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6993335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Patan Hospital"],"locations":["Chalnakhel","Kathmandu"],"keyphrases":["sampled patients","enteric fever","acute fever","increased presentation of patients","epidemiological curve of febrile patients","confirmed diagnosis","generalized illness","pattern of illness","clinical diagnosis","Outbreaks of acute undifferentiated febrile illness","common risk factors","appropriate treatment","mean fever clearance time","treatment decisions","AUFI","clinical characterization","investigation","tap water samples","local inhabitants","detailed characterization","appropriate recommendation","definite association","control efforts","local primary health care centre","different set of questionnaire","Patan Hospital","Chalnakhel locality","Dakchinkali municipality","rickettsial fevers account","azithromycin","Kathmandu","mixture of self-limiting viral infections","influenza","majority","exact etiology","Focused group discussion","Optimal diagnostic tests","Nepal","cefixime","days","BACKGROUND","response","weeks window","recovery course","blood culture","discernible focus of infection","Fecal contamination","ofloxacin","point","illnesses","absence","area","Diseases","controls","rest","households","medical records","antibiotics","household-survey","CONCLUSION","study","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methods\u2014HFNC, HFNC\u002BPP, NIV, NIV\u002BPP\u2014were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003C 100 mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO(2)/FiO(2) in HFNC\u002BPP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125 \u00B1 41 mmHg vs 119 \u00B1 19 mmHg, P = 0.043).

Our objectives were to describe, through electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the impact of PP on global and regional ventilation, and optimal PEEP level. METHODS: A monocentric study conducted on ECMO-supported severe ARDS patients, ventilated in pressure-controlled mode, with 14-cmH(2)O driving pressure and EIT-based \u201Coptimal PEEP\u201D. Before, during and after a 16-h PP session, EIT-based distribution and variation of tidal impedance, VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio, end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and static compliance were collected. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who increased their static compliance by \u2265 3 mL/cmH(2)O after 16 h of PP. RESULTS: For all patients (n = 21), tidal volume and EELI were redistributed from ventral to dorsal regions during PP. EIT-based optimal PEEP was significantly lower in PP than in supine position. Median (IQR) optimal PEEP decreased from 14 (12\u201316) to 10 (8\u201314) cmH(2)O. Thirteen (62%) patients increased their static compliance by \u2265 3 mL/cmH(2)O after PP on ECMO.

METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p \u003C 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p \u003C 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p \u003C 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM \u002B Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM \u002B PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O \u002B PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O \u002B PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 \u002B PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00).

There is no evidence of differences between pressure control ventilation (PCV) and Volume control ventilation (VCV).","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa Souza, George M\u00E1rcio; Santos, Gianni Mara; Zimpel, Sandra Adriana; Melnik, Tamara","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b9738ffb84ed932178680c6384bbf0defa0ebad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7001296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MD","better oxygenation p","higher compliance p","higher plateau pressure p","PEEP lead","pressure control ventilation","vs RM","higher mean airway pressure p","better gas exchange p","cmH2O vs CPAP","vs Positive end-expiratory pressure","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Volume control ventilation","effectiveness of different ventilation strategies","obese patients","Bariatric surgery","adequacy of gas exchange","alveolar recruitment maneuvers","respiration mechanics alterations","evidence of differences","respiratory mechanics","systematic review of randomized clinical trials","PCV","hospital mortality","ZEEP","BMI","safety","increased Body mass index","effective treatment","BACKGROUND","Obesity","global epidemic","Primary outcomes","METHODS","VCV","condition","RESULTS","participants","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-\u03BAB (nuclear factor-\u03BAB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs. Molecules, vaccines, antibodies, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) cells have been developed to specifically target CSCs, and some of these factors are already undergoing clinical trials. This review summarizes the characterization and identification of CSCs, depicts major factors and pathways that regulate CSC development, and discusses potential targeted therapy for CSCs.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Liqun; Shi, Pengfei; Zhao, Gaichao; Xu, Jie; Peng, Wen; Zhang, Jiayi; Zhang, Guanghui; Wang, Xiaowen; Dong, Zhen; Chen, Fei; Cui, Hongjuan","journal":"Signal Transduct Target Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c917c3becd5b37cc4e44ad2c822ba132d339728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7005297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MYC","PPAR","CSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of CSCs","cancer stem cells","cancer therapy","extracellular factors","cancer-associated fibroblasts","biological activities of CSCs","important regulators of CSCs","major factors","mesenchymal stem cells","pluripotent transcription factors","tumor-associated macrophages","AKT","pathways","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","potential targeted therapy","CAR-T","differentiation potential","Janus kinase","NF-\u03BAB","activators of transcription","multidrug resistance","extracellular matrix","growth factor","radiation resistance","chimeric antigen receptor T cell","multiple tumor malignancies","mammalian target of rapamycin","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","recurrence","JAK-STAT","PPAR","Notch","signal transducers","OCT4","CSC development","vascular niches","SMAD","heterogeneity","metastasis","Hedgehog","TGF","Wnt","PI3K","hypoxia","self-renewal capacity","phosphoinositide","KLF4","antibodies","Sox2","mTOR","promising therapeutic targets","vaccines","Nanog","addition","characterization"],"language":"en"},

We aim to estimate the outbreak scale when an EVD infected person arrives in Korea. METHODS: Western Africa EVD epidemic mathematical model SEIJR or SEIJQR was modified to create a Korean EVD outbreak model. The expected number of EVD patients and outbreak duration were calculated by stochastic simulation under the scenarios of Best case, Diagnosis delay, and Case missing. RESULTS: The 2,000 trials of stochastic simulation for each scenario demonstrated the following results: The possible median number of patients is 2 and the estimated maximum number is 11 when the government intervention is proceeded immediately right after the first EVD case is confirmed. With a 6-day delay in diagnosis of the first case, the median number of patients becomes 7, and the maximum, 20. If the first case is missed and the government intervention is not activated until 2 cases of secondary infection occur, the median number of patients is estimated at 15, and the maximum, at 35. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and rigorous diagnosis is important to reduce the spreading scale of infection when a new communicable disease is inflowed into Korea. Moreover, it is imperative to strengthen the local surveillance system and diagnostic protocols to avoid missing cases of secondary infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Youngsuk; Lee, Seok-Min; Kim, Soyoung; Ki, Moran; Jung, Eunok","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a05a9d684b2b6de28b18e78a82585b76a973e258.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9d3e94d800e4c0263d01a9ceed3cc7b6af5a7478.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d77d46a447e665ddfcc2fe9a89a28b83f3050c5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7005456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Korea","Western Africa","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["EVD case","expected number of EVD patients","EVD pandemic","Korean EVD outbreak model","estimated maximum number","possible median number of patients","EVD infected person","outbreak scale","Diagnosis delay","scenarios of Best case","missing cases of secondary infection","Western Africa EVD epidemic mathematical model SEIJR","outbreak duration","spreading scale of infection","rigorous diagnosis","government intervention","trials of stochastic simulation","West Africa","following results","day delay","new communicable disease","frequent reports of Ebola virus disease","diagnostic protocols","SEIJQR","local surveillance system","METHODS","World Health Organization","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly \u226560 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, \u03C7(2) = 202.421, P \u003C 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients \u226560 compared to non-elderly inpatients \u003C 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group.

In 2017\u201318, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018\u201319. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (\u03C4) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran\u0027s Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated Rs for 2017\u201318 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29\u20131.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016\u201317 (1.23 with 95% CI: (1.22, 1.24)) and 2018\u201319 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%\u20131.05%)) rise in R. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions.

LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses.

Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA\u2013NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice after vaccination with the MVA\u2013NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein.

Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism.

Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %), hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization (10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %). In addition, three cases of pulmonary arteriopathy (0.47 %) and 1 case of foreign-body granuloma (0.16 %) were detected in the marmoset study cohort. The high prevalence of circulatory disturbances (congestion, edema, hemorrhage) and changes in air content (secondary atelectasis, alveolar emphysema) could partly be explained by euthanasia-related artifacts or agonal changes. The present study provides a comprehensive overview of the range and incidence of spontaneous pulmonary histopathology in common marmosets, serving as valuable reference data for the interpretation of lung lesions in toxicological and experimental marmoset studies.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bleyer, Martina; Kunze, Marius; Gruber-Dujardin, Eva; M\u00E4tz-Rensing, Kerstin","journal":"Primate Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db3f6cc774e724f7e9be22d7e76d489a1c131a46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7041528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common marmosets","newborn marmosets","common histological findings","interpretation of lung lesions","experimental marmoset studies","incidence of spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions","incidence of spontaneous pulmonary histopathology","high incidence","experimental animals","experimental studies","marmoset study cohort","interpretation of histological findings","spontaneous pathology","Lung immaturity","marmoset colony","lung tissue","cases of pulmonary arteriopathy","present study","Typical background lesions","secondary atelectasis","context of toxicological","agonal changes","laboratory animals","lobar pneumonia","valuable reference data","German Primate Center","multifocal interstitial pneumonia","non-human primate species","high prevalence of circulatory disturbances","detailed knowledge","air content","congestion","hemorrhage","occurrence","range","respiratory research","Bordetella bronchiseptica","edema","spectrum","comprehensive overview","alveolar emphysema","euthanasia-related artifacts","anthracosis","bacterial pathogens","Klebsiella pneumoniae","case of foreign","body granuloma","addition","unknown etiology","extramedullary hematopoiesis","inflammatory cell foci","hemosiderosis","analysis","mineralization","bronchopneumonia"],"language":"en"},

In this meta-analysis including 956 participants, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care during endotracheal intubation regarding incidence of severe hypoxemia, mean lowest oxygen saturation, and in-hospital mortality. HFNC significantly shortened the ICU stay by a mean of 1.8 days. In linear meta-regression interaction analysis, the risk ratio of severe hypoxemia decreased with increasing baseline partial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio. In subgroup analysis, HFNC significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2)\u003E 200 mmHg; risk difference, \u22120.06; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.12 to \u22120.01; number needed to treat = 16.7). In conclusion, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care for oxygen delivery during endotracheal intubation and was associated with a significantly shorter ICU stay.

The antimicrobial effects of beta-amyloid, the localisation of APP/gamma-secretase in immunocompetent dendritic cells, and gamma secretase cleavage of numerous pathogen receptors suggest that this network is concerned with pathogen disposal, effects which may be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the elderly. These autoantibodies, as well as those to nerve growth factor and tau, also observed in Alzheimer\u0027s disease, may well be antibodies to pathogens, due to homology between human autoantigens and pathogen proteins.

It led to the use of search query data from search engines such as Google and Yahoo! as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. This methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge regarding the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance in order to inform future work on early detection and more effective mitigation of the effects of foodborne illness. METHODS: Structured scoping review methods were used to identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert review, and commentary articles regarding the use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases from 2002-2011. RESULTS: Thirty-two primary research articles and 19 reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. Most relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32, 91%) published in 2010-11 (28/32, 88%) and reported use of a Google program for surveillance of influenza. Only four primary research articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. Most authors (21/32 articles, 66%) reported that social media-based surveillance had comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance program. The most commonly reported strengths of social media surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66%) and rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66%). The most commonly reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50%) and false negative (11/32, 34%) results. Most authors (24/32, 75%) recommended that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. CONCLUSIONS: The use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first reported in 2006). Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in machine learning and actively through engagement of users. Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across jurisdictions.","publish_time":"2013-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bernardo, Theresa Marie; Rajic, Andrijana; Young, Ian; Robiadek, Katie; Pham, Mai T; Funk, Julie A","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3785982.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23896182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance of influenza","social media-based surveillance","use of social media","social media programs","digital disease surveillance","existing surveillance systems","existing surveillance programs","reported strengths of social media surveillance programs","surveillance of infectious diseases","reported use","new types of social media","primary research articles","use of search queries","use of search query data","context of foodborne disease","commentary articles","rapid detection of disease","published primary research","reported weaknesses","search engines","primary challenge","expert review","peer-reviewed journal articles","early detection","data signal","early warning systems","potential","Google program","Structured scoping review methods","tools","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","authors","outbreaks of influenza H5N1","diseases of zoonotic origin","relevant citations","effects of foodborne illness","order","effective mitigation","need","future work","comparable performance","global pandemic","SARS","reviews","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","cost","experimentation","case studies","high level of familiarity","machine learning","advances","specificity","Yahoo!","current state of knowledge","sensitivity","effectiveness","recent phenomena","threat","collaboration","surrounding noise","different sources","indicator","gastroenteritis","CONCLUSIONS","developments","engagement of users","BACKGROUND","accuracy","speed","jurisdictions","methodologies","Adoption","methodology","time"],"language":"en"},

Two doses of this vaccine delivered by the intranasal and intratracheal route protected monkeys against intraperitoneal challenge with EBOV; however, concerns exist that the vaccine may have reduced immunogenicity in the adult human population due to pre-existing immunity against HPIV3. Here we developed a new vaccine (NDV/GP) based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus that is antigenically distinct from human viral pathogens and is highly attenuated in monkeys. Following one intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of Rhesus monkeys with NDV/GP, titers of EBOV-specific antibodies in respiratory tract secretions and serum samples determined by ELISA, as well as serum EBOV-neutralizing antibodies, were undetectable or low compared to those induced by HPIV3/GP. A second immunization resulted in a substantial boost in serum IgG ELISA titers, yet the titers remained lower than those induced by a second dose of HPIV3/GP. In contrast, the ELISA IgA titers in respiratory tract secretions and, more importantly, the serum EBOV-neutralizing antibody titers were equal to those induced after the second dose of HPIV3/GP. These data suggest that NDV/GP can be effective for immunization against EBOV alone, or in combination with either HPIV3/GP or another vaccine platform in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.","publish_time":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiNapoli, Joshua M.; Yang, Lijuan; Samal, Siba K.; Murphy, Brian R.; Collins, Peter L.; Bukreyev, Alexander","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fdd6624e91af464e7763c7916ba310e518a9a85.json; document_parses/pdf_json/180a76b34ddfc772fa71463c92ba899d13630b60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3428043.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3428043?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10014933; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10014933; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.10.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","Newcastle","ELISA IgA","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["titers of EBOV","serum EBOV","EBOV GP envelope protein","dose of HPIV3","NDV","respiratory tract vaccine","serum IgG ELISA titers","ELISA IgA titers","respiratory tract secretions","antibody titers","respiratory paramyxovirus","vaccine platform","new vaccine","serum samples","human parainfluenza virus type","Ebola virus","immunization","intratracheal inoculation of Rhesus monkeys","adult human population","human viral pathogens","Newcastle disease virus","specific antibodies","intratracheal route","substantial boost","avian paramyxovirus","heterologous prime-boost regimen","intraperitoneal challenge","reduced immunogenicity","pre-existing immunity","contrast","concerns","combination","added gene","data","doses"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We established an experimental cancer cachexia model by subcutaneously implanting colon 26 cells into the armpits of BALB/c mice. Following administration of MG132 at various time points, body weight, food intake, gastrocnemius muscle weight, spontaneous activity and survival of tumor-bearing mice were examined along with tumor growth. Moreover, cachectic markers including glucose, triglyceride, albumin and total proteins as well as levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue were measured. Finally, mRNA and protein levels of p65, I\u03BAB\u03B1, and ubiquitin E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx in gastrocnemius muscle were assessed. RESULTS: MG132 treatment significantly alleviated cancer cachexia as demonstrated by attenuated weight loss, altered carbohydrate metabolism and muscle atrophy and increased spontaneous activity and survival time of tumor-bearing mice. MG132 reduced tumor growth and the levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue. NF-\u03BAB, MuRF1 and MAFbx were also inhibited by MG132. Unexpectedly, MG132 was more efficient when administrated during the early stages of cachexia. MG132 had no effect on food intake of tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that MG132-induced inhibition of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway in cancer cachexia decreased the activity of NF-\u03BAB and the degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1, and reduced the levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue, accompanied by downregulation of MuRF1 and MAFbx. These data suggest that MG132 is a potential therapeutic and preventive agent for cancer cachexia.","publish_time":"2013-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Liuping; Tang, Hua; Kou, Yao; Li, Rui; Zheng, Yueyong; Wang, Qiang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Jin, Liangbin","journal":"J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8231b806575550b12fe3547017a63715c1ce82b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087863.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535871/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-013-1412-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MG132 treatment","administration of MG132","alleviated cancer cachexia","gastrocnemius tissue","gastrocnemius muscle weight","MG132-induced inhibition","levels of TNF","survival of tumor","effect of proteasome inhibitor MG132","tumor growth","experimental cancer cachexia model","IL","survival time of tumor","food intake of tumor","MAFbx","serum","early stages of cachexia","activity of NF","c mice","body weight","muscle atrophy","increased spontaneous activity","protein levels of p65","proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1","downregulation of MuRF1","RESULTS","NF-\u03BAB","ubiquitin E3 ligases MuRF1","attenuated weight loss","proteasome pathway","degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1","various time points","altered carbohydrate metabolism","implanting colon","triglyceride","preventive agent","glucose","albumin","cells","armpits of BALB","total proteins","cachectic markers","mRNA","molecular mechanism","METHODS","data","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

The presence of an autologous renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated in almost all tissues of the body. It is now known that angiotensin II acts both independently and in synergy with TGF-beta to induce fibrosis via the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)) in a multitude of tissues outside of the cardiovascular and renal systems, including pulmonary fibrosis, intra-abdominal fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis. Interestingly, recent studies have described a paradoxically regenerative effect of the angiotensin system via stimulation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT(2)). Activation of AT(2) has been shown to ameliorate fibrosis in animal models of skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal, and neurologic diseases. Clinical reports suggest a beneficial role for modulation of angiotensin II signaling in cutaneous scarring. This article reviews current knowledge on the role that angiotensin II plays in tissue fibrosis, as well as current and potential therapies targeting this system.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murphy, Amanda M; Wong, Alison L; Bezuhly, Michael","journal":"Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/215fb42f8f5f2ede1ed7e7b1561e51f494593578.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4422447.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13069-015-0023-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25949522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of angiotensin","angiotensin type","modulation of angiotensin","autologous renin-angiotensin system","pulmonary fibrosis","tissue fibrosis","intra-abdominal fibrosis","beneficial role","receptor","renal systems","current knowledge","cardiovascular effects","multitude of tissues","animal models of skeletal muscle","stimulation","regenerative effect","systemic sclerosis","plays","neurologic diseases","Clinical reports","TGF-beta","synergy","presence","potential therapies","article","recent studies","cutaneous scarring","acts","decade","body","Activation"],"language":"en"},

More than 80% of reported cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, with a mortality exceeding 50%. Health-care workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring and transmitting this virus, so the concerns of HCWs in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS were evaluated. METHODS: An anonymous, self-administered, previously validated questionnaire was given to 1031 HCWs at three tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia from October to December, 2014. Concerns regarding the disease, its severity and governmental efforts to contain it, as well as disease outcomes were assessed using 31 concern statements in five distinct domains. A total concern score was calculated for each HCW. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of high concern scores. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 37.1 \u00B1 9.0 years, 65.8% were married and 59.1% were nurses. The majority of respondents (70.4%) felt at risk of contracting a MERS-CoV infection at work, 69.1% felt threatened if a colleague contracted MERS-CoV, 60.9% felt obliged to care for patients infected with MERS-CoV and 87.8% did not feel safe at work using standard precautions. In addition, 87.7% believed that the government should isolate patients with MERS in specialized hospitals, 73.7% agreed with travel restriction to and from areas affected by MERS and 65.3% agreed with avoiding inviting expatriates from such areas. After adjustment for covariates, high concern scores were significantly associated with being a Saudi national (p \u003C 0.001), a non-physician (p \u003C 0.001) and working in the central region (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of respondents reported concern regarding MERS-CoV infection from exposure at work. The overall level of concern may be influenced by previous experience of MERS outbreaks and related cultural issues. The concerns of HCWs may affect their overall effectiveness in an outbreak and should be addressed by incorporating management strategies in outbreak planning.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abolfotouh, Mostafa A.; AlQarni, Ali A.; Al-Ghamdi, Suliman M.; Salam, Mahmoud; Al-Assiri, Mohammed H.; Balkhy, Hanan H.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e594dcc4d1864621d24cc6ffbc70a88a5ae1207d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5210292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-2096-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049440/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","HCW"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS coronavirus","MERS-CoV infection","previous experience of MERS outbreaks","concern statements","concerns of HCWs","Saudi Arabia","overall level of concern","predictors of high concern scores","total concern score","patients","majority of respondents","risk","areas","tertiary hospitals","specialized hospitals","disease outcomes","overall effectiveness","outbreak planning","reported cases","Health-care workers","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","related cultural issues","BACKGROUND","severity","adjustment","covariates","exposure","average age of participants","RESULTS","management strategies","governmental efforts","standard precautions","validated questionnaire","distinct domains","colleague","Multiple regression analyses","travel restriction","non-physician","central region","CONCLUSIONS","mortality","METHODS","years","expatriates","nurses","addition"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Infections of the ENT area are frequent and otitis media in children, sinusitis in adults are generally attributed to viruses or bacterial species. However many non infectious factors play an important role and may lead to useless antibiotic treatments. In otitis media, several factors such as mechanical defect in Eustachian tube, immature immunity, passive tobacco environment are capable to initiate a first viral step of otitis media, followed by bacterial infection due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. Sinusitis are associated to multiple factors and mechanical as well as infective agents (viruses and bacteria) are well established. But several non infectious factors should be analysed and one major factor is allergy which is responsible for repeated sinusitis. Diabetes, anatomical factors, inappropriate muco-ciliary structure, HIV immunodepression can play a significant role in non infectious sinusitis. More work should be done to improve understanding of these complex mechanisms.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barry, B.","journal":"Antibiotiques","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b895217ef64606fe58313f347928e168abf200d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1294550105804546; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1294550105804546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Moraxella"],"keyphrases":["In otitis media","infectious sinusitis","sinusitis in adults","associated to multiple factors","in children","anatomical factors","capable to initiate","significant role in","infectious factors should be analysed","repeated sinusitis","facteurs anatomiques","nombreux facteurs","several factors such as mechanical defect in Eustachian tube","infectious factors play an important role","agents des sinusites infectieuses","mechanical as well as infective agents","generally attributed to viruses or bacterial species","reconnus divers facteurs de risque","bacterial infection","revanche de multiples facteurs","Moraxella catarrhalis","More work should be done to improve understanding","may lead to useless antibiotic treatments","But several","well established","Haemophilus influenzae","Abstract Infections","m\u00E9canismes complexes","infections de la sph\u00E8re ORL","major factor is allergy which is responsible","HIV immunodepression can play","immature immunity","passive tobacco environment","tabagisme passif","ciliary structure","Eustache","pneumocoques","first viral step","frequent","immaturit\u00E9 immunitaire","carence martiale etc","the ENT area","rhinopharynx","inappropriate","these complex mechanisms","followed","pneumoniae","atteinte m\u00E9canique de la trompe","However many","otites","oesophagien","reflux gastro","esp\u00E8ces bact\u00E9riennes","immunod\u00E9pression","anomalies de la fonction","diab\u00E8te","allergie","facteur fr\u00E9quent","enfant","bact\u00E9ries","r\u00F4le","origine bact\u00E9rienne","temps","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","oreille moyenne","Diabetes","\u00E9tiologie multifactorielle","r\u00E9p\u00E9tition","cadre VIH","th\u00E9rapeutiques antibiotiques inutiles","interpr\u00E9tation difficile","recherches"],"language":"fr"},

Methods Multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III clinical trial. Eighty co-infected patients were randomized to receive ribavirin 800\u20131000 mg/day in combination with, group A: interferon alpha2a 3MIU thrice weekly; group B: IFN\u03B12a 3MIU daily, plus amantadine 200 mg/day; treatment duration was 24\u201348 weeks according to HCV genotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective, observational, and multicenter study conducted in 16 tertiary PICUs in Turkey includes a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab which required PICU admission with no interventions. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 12 months. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was more common in patients over one year of age whereas influenza, human Bocavirus in patients above a year of age was more common (p \u003C0.05). Clinical presentations influencing mortality were neurologic symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, and acidosis. The critical pH value related with mortality was \u22647.10, and critical PCO(2) \u226560 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, acidosis, impaired liver, and renal function at the time of admission exhibit more severe mortal progressions. Presence of acidosis and multiorgan failure was found to be predictor for mortality. Knowledge of clinical presentation and age-related variations among seasonal viruses may give a clue about severe course and prognosis.

Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-\u03BB) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-\u03BB induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-\u03BB expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-\u03BB secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-\u03BB3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-\u03BB, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-\u03BB in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome.","publish_time":"2013-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffiths, Samantha J.; Koegl, Manfred; Boutell, Chris; Zenner, Helen L.; Crump, Colin M.; Pica, Francesca; Gonzalez, Orland; Friedel, Caroline C.; Barry, Gerald; Martin, Kim; Craigon, Marie H.; Chen, Rui; Kaza, Lakshmi N.; Fossum, Even; Fazakerley, John K.; Efstathiou, Stacey; Volpi, Antonio; Zimmer, Ralf; Ghazal, Peter; Haas, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7344a564121bf1e3f995911e78c17b1b2aee903.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3738494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950709/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03BB expression","IFN-\u03BB secretion","IFN-\u03BB induction","IFN-\u03BB3","anti-viral effect of Med23","virus replication","Med23 depletion","identification of Med23","synergistic effect of Med23","Vaccinia virus","neurotropic virus","crucial role of IFN","recurrent orofacial HSV","HFs critical","novel HFs","Semliki Forest virus","specific transcription factors","transcription factor IRF7","Herpes simplex virus type","genome-scale screens","RNA interference","RNA polymerase","anti-viral component","inhibitory effect","host factors","major transcription factor","protein interactions","protein level","druggable genome small interfering RNA","pro-viral Mediator complex","multi-protein complexes","power of integrative genome-scale approaches","hybrid screen","disease progression","upregulated expression","treatment outcome","complex interaction","Hepatitis C disease","siRNA","library","genital skin lesions","diseases","meningitis","significant correlation","promoter","RNAi","single nucleotide polymorphism","interferon family","function gene overexpression experiments","viruses","evidence","Genotypic analysis of patients","gain","outbreaks","IL28b","pathways","range","immune control","mRNA","link","immunocompromised individuals","yeast","Bioinformatic analyses","paper","infection"],"language":"en"},

JE virus (JEV) infection causes prominent neurological sequelae in approximately one-third of the survivors. In humans, the inflammatory response of CNS consequent to JEV induced viral encephalitis is mediated through chemokines released by various cells of CNS. In the present study, the chemokine profiles of mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) following JEV infection was analyzed by cDNA microarray followed by real-time RT-PCR. Eighty mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of genes involved in apoptosis and anti-viral response. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during JEV pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, neurotransmitters, neuron maturation, protein modulators, ER stress and cytoskeletal proteins. The infection of neurons results in the synthesis of proinflammatory chemokines, which are early important mediators of leukocyte recruitment to sites of viral infection. Our results clearly suggest the implication of chemokines in neuropathogenesis of JEV infection leading to neurological sequelae. Pro- and anti-inflammatory agents targeted against chemokines such as CXCL10 may provide possible therapeutic modalities that can mitigate the morbidity associated with JEV infection of the CNS.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Nimesh; Santhosh, S.

DESIGN Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care. SETTING Four French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS 181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care. INTERVENTIONS Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group). Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission. In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1). Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies. However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mah\u00E9vas, Matthieu; Tran, Viet-Thi; Roumier, Mathilde; Chabrol, Am\u00E9lie; Paule, Romain; Guillaud, Constance; Fois, Elena; Lepeule, Raphael; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Lescure, Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier; Schlemmer, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Matignon, Marie; Khellaf, Mehdi; Crickx, Etienne; Terrier, Benjamin; Morbieu, Caroline; Legendre, Paul; Dang, Julien; Schoindre, Yoland; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Michel, Marc; Perrodeau, Elodie; Carlier, Nicolas; Roche, Nicolas; de Lastours, Victoire; Ourghanlian, Cl\u00E9ment; Kerneis, Solen; M\u00E9nager, Philippe; Mouthon, Luc; Audureau, Etienne; Ravaud, Philippe; Godeau, Bertrand; Gallien, S\u00E9bastien; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment group","control group","day","potential treatment","discontinuation of treatment","hospital","additional patients","oxygen","overall survival","standard care","routine care","intensive care unit","covid","CONCLUSIONS Hydroxychloroquine","effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine","INTERVENTIONS Hydroxychloroquine","survival rate","inverse probability of treatment weighting","hours of admission","pneumonia","acute respiratory distress syndrome","French tertiary care centres","weighted analyses","documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","transfer","weighted hazard ratio","weighted risk ratio","confidence interval","positive results","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","primary outcome","coronavirus disease","main analysis","DESIGN Comparative observational study","data","years","confounding factors","worldwide attention","SARS-CoV","discharge","home","rehabilitation","Secondary outcomes","electrocardiographic modifications","small studies","dose","use","OBJECTIVE","PARTICIPANTS"],"language":"en"},

Among these, inactivated glycoprotein E (gE)-deleted marker vaccines are commonly used, but their ability to induce passive immunity is poorly known. Here, we evaluated the passive immunity transferred from dams immunised with commercial inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccines to calves. We vaccinated 12 pregnant cattle devoid of neutralising antibodies against Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and divided them into two groups with 6 animals each. Both groups were injected with a different inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccine administrated via intranasal or intramuscular routes. An additional 6 pregnant cattle served as the unvaccinated control group. After calving, the number of animals in each group was increased by the newborn calves. In the dams, the humoral immune response was evaluated before calving and, subsequently, at different times until post-calving day 180 (PCD180). In addition, the antibodies in colostrum, milk, and in serum samples from newborn calves were evaluated at different times until PCD180. The results indicated that inactivated glycoprotein E (gE)-deleted marker vaccines are safe and produce a good humoral immune response in pregnant cattle until calving and PCD180. Moreover, results showed that, in calf serum, passive immunity persists until PCD180.","publish_time":"2020-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrini, Stefano; Righi, Cecilia; Iscaro, Carmen; Viola, Giulio; Gobbi, Paola; Scoccia, Eleonora; Rossi, Elisabetta; Pellegrini, Claudia; De Mia, Gian Mario","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbca7e2fd355a861e69edaaeadddf2754e276c0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157740.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8010014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31947899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCD180","different inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccine","commercial inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccines","Different types of vaccines","different times","passive immunity","inactivated glycoprotein E","newborn calves","pregnant cattle devoid of neutralising antibodies","dams","post-calving day","results","groups","good humoral immune response","Bovine alphaherpesvirus","serum samples","calf serum","number of animals","Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis","unvaccinated control group","IBR","colostrum","milk","intramuscular routes","BoHV","addition","ability"],"language":"en"},

This phenomenon is common to all organisms and the real weight of the many factors involved in its shaping still remains to be fully determined. So far, relatively little attention has been put in the analysis of CUB in bivalve mollusks due to the limited genomic data available. Taking advantage of the massive sequence data generated from next generation sequencing projects, we explored codon preferences in 64 different species pertaining to the six major evolutionary lineages in Bivalvia. We detected remarkable differences across species, which are only partially dependent on phylogeny. While the intensity of CUB is mild in most organisms, a heterogeneous group of species (including Arcida and Mytilida, among the others) display higher bias and a strong preference for AT-ending codons. We show that the relative strength and direction of mutational bias, selection for translational efficiency and for translational accuracy contribute to the establishment of synonymous codon usage in bivalves. Although many aspects underlying bivalve CUB still remain obscure, we provide for the first time an overview of this phenomenon in this large, commercially and environmentally important, class of marine invertebrates.","publish_time":"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerdol, Marco; De Moro, Gianluca; Venier, Paola; Pallavicini, Alberto","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2d2050a4b62e13a5c78e23190f61a7895ca33e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713259/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CUB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bivalve CUB","Synonymous codon usage bias","different species","analysis of CUB","intensity of CUB","establishment of synonymous codon usage","codon preferences","higher bias","organisms","non-random usage of codons","phenomenon","direction of mutational bias","heterogeneous group of species","translational efficiency","translational accuracy","bivalve mollusks","different genomes","massive sequence data","limited genomic data available","selection","generation sequencing projects","amino acid","major evolutionary lineages","Arcida","relative strength","strong preference","bivalves","real weight","factors","class of marine invertebrates","Bivalvia","overview","advantage","aspects","time","remarkable differences","Mytilida","little attention","phylogeny","shaping"],"language":"en"},

While live poultry marketing is widespread throughout the country and known to influence AI dissemination and persistence, trading patterns have not been described. The aim of this study is to assess poultry trading practices and features of the poultry trading networks which could promote AI spread, and their potential implications for disease control and surveillance. Data on poultry trading practices was collected from 849 poultry traders during a cross-sectional survey in 138 live bird markets (LBMs) across 17 different districts of Bangladesh. The quantity and origins of traded poultry were assessed for each poultry type in surveyed LBMs. The network of contacts between farms and LBMs resulting from commercial movements of live poultry was constructed to assess its connectivity and to identify the key premises influencing it. RESULTS: Poultry trading practices varied according to the size of the LBMs and to the type of poultry traded. Industrial broiler chickens, the most commonly traded poultry, were generally sold in LBMs close to their production areas, whereas ducks and backyard chickens were moved over longer distances, and their transport involved several intermediates. The poultry trading network composed of 445 nodes (73.2% were LBMs) was highly connected and disassortative. However, the removal of only 5.6% of the nodes (25 LBMs with the highest betweenness scores), reduced the network\u2019s connectedness, and the maximum size of output and input domains by more than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Poultry types need to be discriminated in order to understand the way in which poultry trading networks are shaped, and the level of risk of disease spread that these networks may promote. Knowledge of the network structure could be used to target control and surveillance interventions to a small number of LBMs. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12917-018-1331-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","publish_time":"2018-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moyen, N.; Ahmed, G.; Gupta, S.; Tenzin, T.; Khan, R.; Khan, T.; Debnath, N.; Yamage, M.; Pfeiffer, D.U.; Fournie, G.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fef1b7df61f24d4ef20baa830f7b89ad75495e40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5767022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29329534/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1331-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["poultry trading practices","poultry trading networks","type of poultry","poultry traders","Poultry types","live poultry marketing","origins of traded poultry","commercial movements of live poultry","LBMs close","surveyed LBMs","trading patterns","small number of LBMs","AI spread","AI dissemination","disease control","nodes","network structure","network of contacts","live bird markets","ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL","backyard chickens","surveillance interventions","maximum size of output","Industrial broiler chickens","different districts of Bangladesh","cross-sectional survey","potential implications","features","production areas","online version","farms","country","network\u2019s connectedness","highest betweenness scores","longer distances","input domains","ducks","persistence","way","study","avian influenza","report","transport","article","level of risk","connectivity","quantity","Data","RESULTS","key premises","order","Knowledge","disassortative","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","intermediates","s12917","users","aim","removal"],"language":"en"},

Taking into account that super-spreading in both information diffusion and spread of a contagious disease are analogous, in this study, we build a parameterized model, the SAIR model, based on well-known epidemic models to characterize super-spreading phenomenon in tweet information propagation accompanied with super-spreaders. For the purpose of modeling information diffusion, empirical observations on a real-world Weibo dataset are statistically carried out. Both the steady-state analysis on the equilibrium and the validation on real-world Weibo dataset of the proposed model are conducted. The case study that validates the proposed model shows that the SAIR model is much more promising than the conventional SIR model in characterizing a super-spreading event of information propagation. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out and discussed to discover how sensitively the parameters affect the information propagation process.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yu; Wang, Bai; Wu, Bin; Shang, Suiming; Zhang, Yunlei; Shi, Chuan","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dffd0c7703f60b884fbfa452fe115f32429935e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288102/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.07.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116304538; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437116304538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Online Social Networks","SAIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["super-spreading event of information propagation","super-spreading events","information propagation process","super-spreading phenomenon","super-spreaders","predictions of information propagation","tweet information propagation","information diffusion process","awareness of super-spreading phenomena","SAIR model","proposed model","harmful information monitoring","purpose of modeling information diffusion","parameterized model","wide-ranged information propagations","conventional SIR model","real-world Weibo dataset","hot topics","case study","Online Social Networks","hot topic detection","small portion of users","social media data mining tasks","empirical observations","understanding of patterns","well-known epidemic models","equilibrium","everyday life","breaking news","OSNs","validation","contagious disease","intervention","messages","microblogging services","steady-state analysis","parameters","account","numerous individuals","addition","numerical simulations","Abstract","attraction"],"language":"en"},

It has been difficult to eradicate the H9N2 virus because of its low pathogenicity, frequently causing in apparent infection. It is important for the control of AI to assess whether the H9N2 virus acquires pathogenicity as H5 and H7 viruses. In the present study, we investigated whether a non-pathogenic H9N2 virus, A/chicken/Yokohama/aq-55/2001 (Y55) (H9N2), acquires pathogenicity in chickens when a pair of di-basic amino acid residues is introduced at the cleavage site of its HA molecule. RESULTS: rgY55sub (H9N2), which had four basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site, replicated in MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin after six consecutive passages in the air sacs of chicks, and acquired intravenous pathogenicity to chicken after four additional passages. More than 75% of chickens inoculated intravenously with the passaged virus, rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2), died, indicating that it is pathogenic comparable to that of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) defined by World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The chickens inoculated with the virus via the intranasal route, however, survived without showing any clinical signs. On the other hand, an avirulent H5N1 strain, A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/2004 (Vac1) (H5N1), acquired intranasal pathogenicity after a pair of di-basic amino acid residues was introduced into the cleavage site of the HA, followed by two passages by air sac inoculation in chicks. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that an H9N2 virus has the potential to acquire intravenous pathogenicity in chickens although the morbidity via the nasal route of infection is lower than that of H5N1 HPAIV.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soda, Kosuke; Asakura, Shingo; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; kida, Hiroshi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a040109f4ae97738c7940d711a60f07f573b9754.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310053/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-64","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK","World Organization for Animal Health"],"locations":["Asia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["non-pathogenic H9N2 virus","intravenous pathogenicity","low pathogenicity","low pathogenic H9N2 viruses","intranasal pathogenicity","chickens","passaged virus","basic amino acid residues","HA cleavage site","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","consecutive passages","pair","additional passages","H7 viruses","nasal route of infection","apparent infection","HA molecule","H5N1 HPAIV","intranasal route","present results","Outbreaks of avian influenza","air sacs of chicks","avirulent H5N1 strain","control of AI","rgY55sub-P10","present study","air sac inoculation","HPAIVs","poultry","morbidity","World Organization","MDCK cells","Asia","serious economic losses","duck","absence of trypsin","potential","Hokkaido","Animal Health","OIE","Yokohama","Middle East","aq","Vac1","hand","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","clinical signs"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods The model of fever syndrome of Chinese medicine pattern was imitated by LPS injection i.v. in rabbits, and BHT was gavaged. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), interleukin (IL-6, 10) and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested by biochemical methods. Liver tissue damage was detected by hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H\u0026E) stain. Subpopulation of T cells was detected by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). Genes expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in liver tissue were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

In infected cells, N proteins are present at the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), the sites of CoV RNA synthesis. It has been shown that N proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a commonly used model CoV, interacts with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the RTCs. These two aspects of the CoV life cycle, however, have not been linked. We found that the MHV N protein binds exclusively to nsp3 and not other RTC components by using a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach, and we identified two distinct regions in the N protein that redundantly mediate this interaction. A selective N protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind nsp3 in vitro, resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to RTCs in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type N protein, this N protein variant impairs the stimulation of genomic RNA and viral mRNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, which in turn leads to impairment of MHV replication and progeny production. Altogether, our results show that N protein recruitment to RTCs, via binding to nsp3, is an essential step in the CoV life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE CoVs have long been regarded as relatively harmless pathogens for humans. Severe respiratory tract infection outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, however, have caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in humans. These outbreaks highlighted the relevance of being able to control CoV infections. We used a model CoV, MHV, to investigate the importance of the recruitment of N protein, a central component of CoV virions, to intracellular platforms where CoVs replicate, transcribe, and translate their genomes. By identifying the principal binding partner at these intracellular platforms and generating a specific mutant, we found that N protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral RNA synthesis.

Research over the last decades has identified an additional role of lipids in cellular signaling, membrane microdomain organization and dynamics, and membrane trafficking. These properties make lipids an attractive target for pathogens to modulate host cell processes in order to allow their survival and replication. In this review we will summarize the often ingenious strategies of pathogens to modify the lipid homeostasis of host cells, allowing them to divert cellular processes. To this end pathogens take full advantage of the complexity of the lipidome. The examples are categorized in generalized and emerging principles describing the involvement of lipids in host\u2013pathogen interactions. Several pathogens are described that simultaneously induce multiple changes in the host cell signaling and trafficking mechanisms. Elucidation of these pathogen-induced changes may have important implications for drug development. The emergence of high-throughput lipidomic techniques will allow the description of changes of the host cell lipidome at the level of individual molecular lipid species and the identification of lipid biomarkers.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Meer-Janssen, Ynske P.M.; van Galen, Josse; Batenburg, Joseph J.; Helms, J.

Progressive urbanization in Asia and South-Central America and the geographic expansion of Aedes mosquito habitats have accelerated the global spread of dengue, resulting in a continuously increasing number of cases. A cost-effective, safe vaccine conferring protection with ideally a single injection could stop dengue transmission. Current vaccine candidates require several booster injections or do not provide protection against all four serotypes. Here we demonstrate that dengue virus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity are highly sensitive to type I IFN inhibition. The mutant viruses are attenuated in mice and rhesus monkeys and elicit a strong adaptive immune response. Monkeys immunized with a single dose of 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant virus showed 100% sero-conversion even when a dose as low as 1,000 plaque forming units was administrated. Animals were fully protected against a homologous challenge. Furthermore, mosquitoes feeding on blood containing the mutant virus were not infected, whereas those feeding on blood containing wild-type virus were infected and thus able to transmit it.

Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.","publish_time":"1988-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morse, Stephen S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de8d835d3077420d25b6c03b68ef7b2c5b1d4694.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288902620; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288902620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTLV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nude mice","MTLV","T lymphotropic","shed virus","virus shedding","persistent infection","infected mice","developing T lineage lymphocytes","lymphotropic herpesvirus","Abstract Mouse thymic virus","thymus of neonatal mice","euthymic littermates","murid herpesvirus","young adult athymic nude","nulnu","number of epithelial","isolations","fibroblastic cell lines","days postinfection","Blind passage","order","samples","herpesviruses","requirements","addition","data"],"language":"en"},

Wild boar natural populations are experiencing a demographical expansion as well as some farms are breeding this species to release for hunting with management sometimes identical to that of domestic pigs, including supplementation, grouping, and antibiotic treatments. This situation increases the chance of contact between wild boars and livestock, and potentially induces stress, with different sanitary consequences. The present work aims to describe the clinical features of recent outbreaks caused by S. Choleraesuis in wild boar from central\u2010western Spain, as well as the antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic relationships of isolates involved. 28 strains of S. Choleraesuis were isolated from 28 different wild boars belonging to 10 different game states located in central western Spain and submitted to the Clinical Veterinary Hospital (CVH) of the University of Extremadura. Samples were taken from different organs and cultured according to the ISO 6579:2002 procedure. Suspicious colonies were identified by PCR and antimicrobial resistance was evaluated by disc diffusion susceptibility test and the presence of the main resistance genes as well as 18 plasmid replicons frequently found among the Enterobacteriaceae was verified by PCR. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was applied to determine the genetic relationship between isolates. The outbreaks under study were characterized by high mortality (35%\u201384%) and a septicaemic presentation. S. Choleraesuis was isolated from all the wild boars analysed, and 26 of the 28 isolates presented resistance to at least one antibiotic. The predominant resistances found were against sulphonamide, streptomycin, tetracycline, and doxicicline and sul1, strA\u2010strB, and tetA were the most prevalent resistance genes among isolates. 10 strains carried FIIA, FIB\u002BH/1 or FIIA\u002BH/1 plasmids. PFGE classified the isolates into four different profiles, grouped into two clusters. This results show that prevention against S.

It also inhibited giant cell formation in co-cultures of HIV-infected cells and uninfected Molt-4 cells. Sukumo extract was found to interact with both the viral envelope glycoprotein and cellular receptors, thus blocking virus-cell binding and virus-induced syncytium formation. There was a good correlation between the extract\u0027s anti-HIV-1 activity and its inhibitory effects on HIV-1 binding. It also suppressed replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 11.56\u03BCg/ml. On the other hand, there was no appreciable activity against influenza A virus, poliovirus or SARS corona virus when tested at concentrations ranging from 3.2\u2013400\u03BCg/ml as shown by microscopic image analysis for cytopathic effect (CPE). Physico-chemical studies revealed that the anti-HIV activity in the extract was essentially maintained after boiling at 100\u00B0C in 1N HCl or 1N NaOH, and after treatment with 100mM NaIO4. The inhibitory activity of the extract was also not reduced after pronase digestion.

The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 52,020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (\u003E15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host.

These patients are vulnerable and susceptible to the environment surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU. To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children\u0027s Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens. Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM(10)) (0.6\u20132.2 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3), median: 0.9 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3)) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1\u20132.8 \u00D7 10(3) p cm(\u2212 3), median: 0.67 \u00D7 10(3) p cm(\u2212 3)) concentrations were significantly lower (p \u003C 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7\u201310.2 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3), median: 8.0 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3) for PM(10) and 12.1\u201322.2 \u00D7 10(3) p cm(\u2212 3), median: 16.4 \u00D7 10(3) p cm(\u2212 3) for PN). In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background. We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM(10) concentrations from 0.1 \u00D7 10(3) to 100 \u00D7 10(3) p cm(\u2212 3), and from 2 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3) to 70 \u03BCg m(\u2212 3), respectively. The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. The average PM(10) and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41 mg min(\u2212 1) and from 1.20 to 3.96 p min(\u2212 1) \u00D7 10(11), respectively. Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms. The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified. Based on the findings from the study, we developed a set of practical recommendations for PICU design, as well as for medical and cleaning staff to mitigate aerosol generation and transmission to minimize infection risk to PICU patients.","publish_time":"2017-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Congrong; Mackay, Ian M.; Ramsay, Kay; Liang, Zhen; Kidd, Timothy; Knibbs, Luke D.; Johnson, Graham; McNeale, Donna; Stockwell, Rebecca; Coulthard, Mark G.; Long, Debbie A.; Williams, Tara J.; Duchaine, Caroline; Smith, Natalie; Wainwright, Claire; Morawska, Lidia","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16704e9a2b5bcfd1ce150f52e6b8f5ed5cfb927c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172583.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017302015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692913/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412017302015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU","Royal Children\u0027s Hospital PICU","PN"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["indoor particle concentrations","\u03BCg","substantial indoor particle sources","strong indoor particle sources","PICU patients","increased indoor PN","PICU design","hour average indoor particle mass","outdoor concentrations","indoor air quality","submicrometer particle number","average PM","outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements","Royal Children\u0027s Hospital PICU","outdoor particles","PN emission rates of nebulization therapy","isolated bacterial genera","cleaning staff","cleaning activities","presence of bacterial","paediatric intensive care unit","isolated single-bed rooms","two-week period","broth cultures","tracheal suction","aerosol generation","transmission","infection risk","little information available","skin commensals","Brisbane","factors","ill neonates","set of practical recommendations","viruses","infants","Australia","knowledge","viral pathogens","negligible background","gap","multipoint measurement data","environment","study","bioaerosol samples","findings","results","locations"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide is set to increase from its present level of 150 million, to 225 million by the end of the decade and to as many as 300 million by 2025. Shocking as they are, these figures represent only clinically diagnosed diabetes, and many more cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, up to one-quarter of western populations have impaired glucose tolerance or the dysmetabolic syndrome, which are considered to represent pre-diabetic states. Type 2 diabetes is appearing increasingly in children and adolescents, and the frequency of diagnosis of paediatric type 2 diabetes is outstripping that of type 1 diabetes in some areas. The long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes carries a crushing burden of morbidity and mortality, and most type 2 diabetic patients die prematurely from a cardiovascular event. Diabetic patients are more than twice as costly to manage as non-diabetic patients, due mainly to the high costs associated with management of diabetic complications. Indeed, diabetes care already accounts for about 2-7% of the total national health care budgets of western European countries. Controlling the type 2 diabetes epidemic will require changes to the structure of healthcare delivery. Well-resourced interventions will be required, with effective co-ordination between all levels of government, health care agencies, multidisciplinary health care teams, professional organisations, and patient advocacy groups. Above all, intervention is needed today.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmet, P.","journal":"Diabetes \u0026 Metabolism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/928b4033a15e676025509b5100682341c9a7c824.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363603727839; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363603727839","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes care","diabetes epidemic","cases of diabetes","paediatric type","prevalence of type","global pandemic of type","non-diabetic patients","health care agencies","management of diabetic complications","multidisciplinary health care teams","pre-diabetic states","total national health care budgets of western European countries","levels of government","levels of obesity","long-term complications","quarter of western populations","professional organisations","impaired glucose tolerance","changes","sedentary lifestyles","energy-rich diets","frequency of diagnosis","mortality","crushing burden of morbidity","patient advocacy groups","dysmetabolic syndrome","high costs","effective co-ordination","structure of healthcare delivery","adolescents","children","cardiovascular event","Summary","figures","areas","Well-resourced interventions","present level","end","decade","addition"],"language":"en"},

Overall, cruise lines were efficient at the operating stage, but varied widely in the efficiency of the non-operating stage.

Viral recognition by TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) has been proven to be cell-type specific. Triggering of TLRs with selected ligands can be beneficial against some viral infections. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells that express TLRs and have a key role in the innate and adaptive immunity against viruses. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that cause acute and chronic infections and can productively infect macrophages. Investigation of the interplay between CoVs and PRRs is in its infancy. We assessed the effect of triggering TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 with selected ligands on the susceptibility of the J774A.1 macrophage cell line to infection with murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, [MHV]). Stimulation of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR7 did not affect MHV production. In contrast, pre-stimulation of TLR3 with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) hindered MHV infection through induction of IFN-\u03B2 in macrophages. We demonstrate that activation of TLR3 with the synthetic ligand poly I:C mediates antiviral immunity that diminishes (MHV-A59) or suppresses (MHV-JHM, MHV-3) virus production in macrophages.","publish_time":"2012-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazaleuskaya, Liudmila; Veltrop, Rogier; Ikpeze, Nneka; Martin-Garcia, Julio; Navas-Martin, Sonia","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62f5729ba9ae176c206cafd0221804a80772ea37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3386628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22754655/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4050901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV production","MHV infection","Macrophages","MHV-A59","MHV-JHM","sense viral infections","express TLRs","Viral recognition","virus production","production of type","activation of TLR3","TLR4","TLR7","pre-stimulation of TLR3","chronic infections","selected ligands","Stimulation of TLR2","CoVs","PRRs","pattern recognition receptors","cell-type specific","effect of triggering TLR2","adaptive immunity","positive-sense RNA viruses","antiviral immunity","synthetic ligand poly","mouse hepatitis virus","macrophage cell line","murine coronavirus","polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid","key role","induction of IFN","J774A","susceptibility","interferons","IFNs","antigen","cells","cytokines","interplay","contrast","Investigation","Coronaviruses","infancy","Toll","chemokines"],"language":"en"},

Currently anti-TNF-\u03B1 drugs (e.g. etanercept) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-\u03B1 in the development of virus-endotoxin-induced respiratory disease. Twenty-two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used. Initially, the availability in the lungs and circulation, and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/per route/per pig. High anti-TNF-\u03B1 activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 hours post inoculation (HPI). No clinical symptoms, lung lesions, lung cell infiltration or induction of IFN-\u03B1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u03B1 in BAL were detected. Subsequently, the ability of etanercept to block porcine TNF-\u03B1 and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs. They were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hours later. Etanercept was administered at the time of LPS inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment. The parameters were compared with a control group (n=8), receiving only PRCV-LPS. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 hours after LPS inoculation. TNF-\u03B1 was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 HPI and significantly lower than in the PRCV-LPS group at all times. No significant differences in disease severity, lung lesions, virus replication, lung cell infiltration or levels of IFN-\u03B1, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 were observed between the two groups. Blocking of TNF-\u03B1 alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators.","publish_time":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atanasova, Kalina; Van Gucht, Steven; Van Reeth, Kristien","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8398a58122af240a367fa4af583ff4adea08ede8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2922464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466438/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.04.003; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2922464?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242710001182; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242710001182","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","HPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine TNF-\u03B1","anti-TNF-\u03B1 drugs","role of TNF","High anti-TNF-\u03B1 activity","PRCV-LPS group","PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease","lung lesions","Tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1","time of LPS inoculation","lung cell infiltration","lung virus titres","disease severity","animals","hours","ability of etanercept","unidentified disease mediators","inflammatory effects of etanercept","virus replication","development of virus","BAL","porcine respiratory coronavirus","control group","HPI","peritoneal lavage fluids","levels of IFN","induction of IFN","bronchoalveolar lavage","clinical symptoms","mentioned parameters","inflammatory conditions","caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs","involvement","circulation","serum","significant differences","proinflammatory cytokine cascade","lungs","dose","humans","redundancy","routes","endotoxin","lipopolysaccharide","intraperitoneal administration","treatment of autoimmune diseases","intratracheal","rest","times","initial experiment","availability","Half","study","groups"],"language":"en"},

Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.","publish_time":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strauss, Ellen G.; De Groot, Raoul J.; Levinson, Randy; Strauss, James H.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/122a820ff22197145ea286630847c743c0492b5a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290268T; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290268T","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sindbis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus","catalytic residues","virus-encoded proteinase","conserved asparagine residues","mutations","proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins","full-length clone of Sindbis virus","Sindbis replication","proteolytic activity","conserved histidines","conserved serine","functional proteinase","active site residues","active site of papain","C-terminal domain of nsP2","catalytic histidine","catalytic dyad","C-terminal half of nsP2","alphaviruses","total loss of activity","presence of Trp","mutant enzyme","glycine","alanine","proteolysis","animal enzymes","plant","mutagenic analysis","infectious RNA","amino acids","proteinases","effects","changes","viability","cysteine","results","Substitutions","cases"],"language":"en"},

Although plans for using 30-day readmission measures are under consideration for younger patients, little is known about readmission in younger patients or the relationship between readmissions in younger and elderly patients at the same hospital. Methods By using the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we examined readmission patterns in younger patients (18-64 years) using hierarchical models to evaluate associations between hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients and readmission risk in younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. Results There were 87,818, 98,315, and 103,251 admissions in younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively, with overall 30-day unplanned readmission rates of 8.5%, 21.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Readmission risk in younger patients was significantly associated with hospital 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates for elderly Medicare patients for all 3 conditions. A decrease in an average hospital\u0027s 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile was associated with reduction in younger patients\u0027 risk of readmission from 8.8% to 8.0% (difference: 0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9) for acute myocardial infarction; 21.8% to 20.0% (difference: 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.2) for heart failure; and 13.9% to 13.1% (difference: 0.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0) for pneumonia. Conclusions Among younger patients, readmission risk was moderately associated with hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare beneficiaries.

Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is considered the principal component in Glycyrrhiza spp. with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity. Aim The present study attempt to validate the medicinal use of Glycyrrhiza uralensis for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and further to verify whether GA is an active antiviral component in the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Materials and methods Radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. were extracted with hot water. The chemical contents of the extract were profiled with HPLC analysis. The antiviral activity of the extract and the major components was evaluated against infection of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) on Vero cells. The cytopathic effect caused by the infection was measured with MTT assay. Infectious virion production was determined using secondary infection assays and viral protein expression by immunoblotting analysis. Results The extract at 1000\u03BCg/ml suppressed EV71 replication by 1.0 log and CVA16 by 1.5 logs. The antiviral activity was associated with the content of GA in the extract since selective depletion of GA from the extract by acid precipitation resulted in loss of antiviral activity. In contrast, the acid precipitant retained antiviral activity. The precipitant at a concentration of 200\u03BCg/ml inhibited EV71 and CVA16 replication by 1.7 and 2.2 logs, respectively. Furthermore, GA dose-dependently blocked viral replication of EV71 and CVA16. At 3mM, GA reduced infectious CVA16 and EV71 production by 3.5 and 2.2 logs, respectively. At 5mM, CVA16 production was reduced by 6.0 logs and EV71 by 4.0 logs. Both EV71 and CVA16 are members of Enterovirus genus, time-of-drug addition studies however showed that GA directly inactivated CVA16, while GA anti-EV71 effect was associated with an event(s) post virus cell entry. Conclusions This study validated the medicinal usefulness of radices Glycyrrhiza uralensis against the etiological agents of HFMD. In addition to the identification of GA as the antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis against EV71 and CVA16 infection, this study also reveals that GA inhibits EV71 and CVA16 with distinct mechanisms.","publish_time":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jingjing; Chen, Xiaoqing; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Yating; Yang, Ziying; Jin, Yu; Ge, Hui Ming; Li, Erguang; Yang, Guang","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3bcb07631afa12bc098d945bb31db52e8469455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125661.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.02.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874113001116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874113001116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23454684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GA","HPLC","MTT","HFMD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CVA16 infection","EV71 production","CVA16 replication","CVA16 production","antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis","infectious CVA16","GA anti-EV71 effect","water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis","inhibited EV71","GA dose","identification of GA","content of GA","logs","blocked viral replication of EV71","suppressed EV71 replication","loss of antiviral activity","medicinal use of Glycyrrhiza uralensis","medicinal usefulness of radices Glycyrrhiza uralensis","methods Radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch","selective depletion of GA","active antiviral component","wide spectrum of antiviral activity","viral hepatitis","infection of enterovirus","acid precipitant","viral protein expression","viral skin diseases","treatment of viral induced cough","secondary infection assays","principal component","\u03BCg","acid precipitation","Infectious virion production","present study","Glycyrrhizic acid","herbal medicine","immunoblotting analysis","herbal preparations","cytopathic effect","HPLC analysis","hot water","members of Enterovirus genus","etiological agents of HFMD","drug addition studies","hand","time","event","foot","post virus cell entry","coxsackievirus A16","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","mouth disease","ulcers","China","major components","Materials","thousands of years","Vero cells","distinct mechanisms","concentration","Conclusions","contrast","MTT assay","chemical contents"],"language":"en"},

There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection. The effort to understand the complex interactions of ZIKV with cellular networks contributes to the identification of novel host-directed antiviral (HDA) candidates. Among the cellular pathways involved in infection, lipid metabolism gains attention. In ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism attributed to intracellular membrane remodeling, virion morphogenesis, autophagy modulation, innate immunity and inflammation. The key roles played by the cellular structures associated with lipid metabolism, such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets, are starting to be deciphered. Consequently, there is a wide variety of lipid-related antiviral strategies that are currently under consideration, which include an inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), the activation of adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), an inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), interference with sphingolipid metabolism, blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or a treatment with cholesterol derivatives. Remarkably, most of the HDAs identified in these studies are also effective against flaviviruses other than ZIKV (West Nile virus and dengue virus), supporting their broad-spectrum effect. Considering that lipid metabolism is one of the main cellular pathways suitable for pharmacological intervention, the idea of repositioning drugs targeting lipid metabolism as antiviral candidates is gaining force.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDn-Acebes, Miguel A.; Jim\u00E9nez de Oya, Nereida; Saiz, Juan-Carlos","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcf74132e357aaadf7be22016a76d437664db797.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631711.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ph12020097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism","lipid droplets","lipid metabolism gains attention","sphingolipid metabolism","ZIKV infection","antiviral treatment","antiviral candidates","wide variety of lipid","cellular networks","cellular structures","complex interactions of ZIKV","related antiviral strategies","main cellular pathways suitable","dengue virus","Zika virus","West Nile virus","blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking","inhibition of acetyl","cholesterol derivatives","intracellular membrane remodeling","inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins","autophagy modulation","virion morphogenesis","pharmacological intervention","idea of repositioning drugs","neurological disorders","ocular lesions","SREBP","innate immunity","activation of adenosine","microcephaly","kinase","AMPK","carboxylase","flaviviruses","interference","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","identification of novel host","birth defects","licensed vaccine","monophosphate","inflammation","Coenzyme","peroxisomes","studies","key roles","consideration","mosquito","force","broad-spectrum effect","effort","HDAs"],"language":"en"},

Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39\u2014a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex\u2014as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7\u002B and Lamp1\u002B endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs\u2014an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape.","publish_time":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steinauer, Angela; LaRochelle, Jonathan R.; Wissner, Rebecca; Berry, Samuel; Schepartz, Alanna","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69f473aee22a4ac8df15a54a6109b70b1ae9b7e7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1b940c1fc2a1124684e979259cb38365883ef414.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/374926","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPMPs traffic","trafficking of CPMPs","cytosol","products of HOPS","HOPS function","HOPS activity","endosomal rupture","endosomal lumen","endosomes","efficient endosomal escape","cell-penetrating peptides","efficiency of endosomal release","primary means of endosomal escape","hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active","ILVs","CPPs","cell-permeant miniature proteins","protein sorting","homotypic fusion","Protein therapeutics","complementary cell-based assays","penta-arginine motif traffic","mediated fusion","Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies","screen","RNAi","FCS","fluorescence correlation spectroscopy","growing component","RNA interference","subunit","Rab7","complex","animals","modern pharmacopeia","intraluminal vesicles","critical determinant","potential","VPS39","Lamp1","prerequisite","endocytic pathway","factors","broad spectrum of techniques","gene","human disease","difference","efficiencies","environment","nucleus","biological membranes","results"],"language":"en"},

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction methods have been successful in compensating for the missing information and suppressing noise with their intrinsic regularization techniques. There are two major problems in MAP reconstruction methods: (1) selection of the regularization parameter that controls the balance between the data fidelity and the prior information, and (2) long computation time. One aim of this study is to provide an adaptive solution to the regularization parameter selection problem without having additional knowledge about the imaging environment and the sample. The other aim is to realize the reconstruction using sequences of resolution levels to shorten the computation time. The reconstructions were analyzed in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency using a simulated biological phantom and publically available experimental datasets of electron tomography. The numerical and visual evaluations of the experiments show that the adaptive multiresolution method can provide more accurate results than the weighted back projection (WBP), simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), and sequential MAP expectation maximization (sMAPEM) method.

Plants are known to lack sialic acid. But they are reported to occur in viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Deaminated neuraminic acid although occurs in vertebrates and bacteria, is reported to occur in abundance in the lower vertebrates. Sialic acids are mostly located in terminal ends of glycoproteins and glycolipids, capsular and tissue polysialic acids, bacterial lipooligosaccharides/polysaccharides, and in different forms that dictate their role in biology. Sialic acid play important roles in human physiology of cell-cell interaction, communication, cell-cell signaling, carbohydrate-protein interactions, cellular aggregation, development processes, immune reactions, reproduction, and in neurobiology and human diseases in enabling the infection process by bacteria and virus, tumor growth and metastasis, microbiome biology, and pathology. It enables molecular mimicry in pathogens that allows them to escape host immune responses. Recently sialic acid has found role in therapeutics. In this chapter we have highlighted the (i) diversity of sialic acid, (ii) their occurrence in the diverse life forms, (iii) sialylation and disease, and (iv) sialic acid and therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Shyamasree","journal":"Sialic Acids and Sialoglycoconjugates in the Biology of Life, Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d8766c779e74faecf2514a5a9d2c0e1ff71a46c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153325.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128161265000019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128161265000019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Echinoderms"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diversity of sialic acid","cell-cell","Abstract Sialic acids","Deaminated neuraminic acid","cell interaction","human physiology of cell","therapeutics","tissue polysialic acids","important molecule","important roles","human diseases","immune reactions","microbiome biology","different forms","higher animals","lower vertebrates","high structural diversity","diverse life forms","host immune responses","development processes","cellular aggregation","glycolipids","tumor growth","carbohydrate-protein interactions","metastasis","bacterial lipooligosaccharides","reproduction","polysaccharides","infection process","Hemichordata","terminal ends of glycoproteins","communication","Echinoderms","neurobiology","occurrence","pathogens","Cephalochorda","Platyhelminthes","Cephalopoda","Vertebrata","sialylation","pathology","protozoa","molecular mimicry","Crustaceae","abundance","viruses","fungi","Plants","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Atopy predisposes to infections of the target organ, i.e. the site of the allergic reaction. As allergic inflammation prepares the terrain for these infections, it is particularly important to fight against allergic inflammation by eliminating allergens and irritants from the atopic subject\u0027s environment. In some cases, topical anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cromoglycate or corticosteroids spray or ointment, must be used. Reciprocally, infections of the target organ accentuate atopic diseases by superimposing their specific inflammatory phenomena onto those of the allergic reaction, by amplifying this reaction and by creating hyperreactivity of the target organ. The possible role of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in the pathogenesis of certain severe forms of chronic asthma could attribute a place to macrolides in the treatment or even the prophylaxis of asthma.","publish_time":"2000-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radermecker, M.","journal":"Revue Fran\u00E7aise d\u0027Allergologie et d\u0027Immunologie Clinique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f7d92a1bd8c9e14af92229361b66db2821077bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0335745700800349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0335745700800349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287956/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0335-7457(00)80034-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allergic reaction","allergic inflammation","target organ","atopy","possible role of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections","atopic diseases","prophylaxis of asthma","atopic subject\u0027s environment","pathogenesis of certain severe forms of chronic asthma","cromoglycate","irritants","allergens","specific inflammatory phenomena","topical anti-inflammatory drugs","reciprocal relationships","treatment","place","site","corticosteroids spray","ointment","cases","macrolides","hyperreactivity","terrain","Summary"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size, with a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by 3 June 2013, in 10 Chinese provinces and Taiwan. The incidence of A/H7N9 cases has stalled in recent weeks, presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas. Here we compare the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other emerging pathogens and evaluate the impact of intervention measures in an effort to guide pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We used a Bayesian approach combined with a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) transmission model fitted to daily case data to assess the reproduction number (R) of A/H7N9 by province and to evaluate the impact of live bird market closures in April and May 2013. Simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen, where human-to-human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events. We also used alternative approaches to estimate R based on individual-level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other recent zoonoses. RESULTS: Estimates of R for the A/H7N9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human-to-human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period, with broad 95% credible intervals by the Bayesian method (0.01 to 0.49). The Bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution, however, due to relatively little information contained in the case data. We observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 April 2013, which is consistent with a reduction in A/H7N9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets. Although confidence intervals are broad, the estimated transmission potential of A/H7N9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats, including avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. CONCLUSION: Although uncertainty remains high in R estimates for H7N9 due to limited epidemiological information, all available evidence points to a low transmission potential. Continued monitoring of the transmission potential of A/H7N9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months.","publish_time":"2013-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Simonsen, Lone; Towers, Sherry; Miller, Mark A; Viboud, C\u00E9cile","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55844fc8a5cb75ffa1a249436ad30d6d93792df5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3851127.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-11-214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 transmission","human transmission","transmission potential of influenza","H7N9 cases","H7N9 virus","H7N9 outbreak","disease transmission","transmission model","estimated transmission potential","low transmission potential","avian influenza","novel influenza","Estimates of R","R estimates","sustained human","human infections","Bayesian approach","impact of live bird market closures","swine influenza H3N2sw","Bayesian estimation approach","consequence of live bird market closures","impact of intervention measures","limited epidemiological information","little information","recent weeks","recent zoonoses","Bayesian method","preemptive closure of live bird markets","individual-level information","daily case data","recent zoonotic threats","prior exposure","Nipah virus","credible intervals","coming months","colder months","confidence intervals","prior distribution","emerging pathogens","available evidence","H5N1","effort","seasonal factors","epidemic threshold","reproduction number","performance","total","context","uncertainty","SEIR","geographic scope","significant deceleration","growth rate","size","Eastern China","reduction","pandemic preparedness","study period","affected areas","alternative approaches","Chinese provinces","Taiwan","Simulation studies","CONCLUSION","spillover events","laboratory","RESULTS","METHODS","incidence","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Recent research suggests that this seasonality in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections. Regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections; unfortunately, achieving hand washing recommendations in schools is difficult. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with asthma. Purpose To describe the process of redesigning the trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools. Methods The original trial was a randomized, longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma exacerbations in elementary-age children. Three events occurred that required major modifications to the original study protocol: (1) safety concerns arose regarding the hand sanitizer\u2019s active ingredient; (2) no substitute placebo hand sanitizer was available; and (3) community preferences changed regarding hand hygiene practices in the schools. Results The revised protocol is a randomized, longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations. Enrollment was completed in May 2009 with 527 students from 30 schools. The intervention began in August 2009 and will continue through May 2011. Study results should be available at the end of 2011. Limitations The changed design does not allow us to directly measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices. Conclusions The need to balance a rigorous study design with one that is acceptable to the community requires investigators to be actively involved with community collaborators and able to adapt study protocols to fit changing community practices.","publish_time":"2011-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerald, Lynn B; Gerald, Joe K; McClure, Leslie A; Harrington, Kathy; Erwin, Sue; Bailey, William C","journal":"Clin Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fb48248ba087b62ed753f63f4ff046e68828bf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3145214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21730079/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774511403513","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hand hygiene education","usual hand hygiene practices","hand washing recommendations","Regular hand washing","effect of hand sanitizer use","alcohol-based hand sanitizer","substitute placebo hand sanitizer","incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use","two-step hand hygiene process","traditional hand washing practices","hand sanitizer\u2019s active ingredient","elementary schools","community-based crossover trial","changing community practices","community collaborators","community preferences","Study results","Background Asthma exacerbations","study protocols","original study protocol","original trial","elementary-age children","rigorous study design","elementary-age students","changes","primary aim","changed design","spread of viral respiratory infections","viral respiratory tract infections","usual care","safety concerns","safety profile","revised protocol","addition","supplement","greatest risk","major modifications","response","effective method","subject-blinded","need","school following summer break","seasonality","Methods","investigators","Recent research","Conclusions","events","Limitations","Purpose","Enrollment","intervention"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epidemiological analysis was performed on data from all MERS-CoV cases recorded by the Saudi Ministry of Health between June 6, 2013 and May 14, 2014. The frequency of cases and deaths was calculated and adjusted by month, sex, age group, and region. The average monthly temperature and humidity of infected regions throughout the year was also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 425 cases were recorded over the study period. The highest number of cases and deaths occurred between April and May 2014. Disease occurrence among men (260 cases [62%]) was higher than in women (162 cases [38%]), and the case fatality rate was higher for men (52%) than for women (23%). In addition, those in the 45\u201359 years and \u226560 years age groups were most likely to be infected, and the case fatality rate for these people was higher than for other groups. The highest number of cases and deaths were reported in Riyadh (169 cases; 43 deaths), followed by Jeddah (156 cases; 36 deaths) and the Eastern Region (24 cases; 22 deaths). The highest case fatality rate was in the Eastern Region (92%), followed by Medinah (36%) and Najran (33%). MERS-CoV infection actively causes disease in environments with low relative humidity (\u003C20%) and high temperature (15\u00B0C\u201335\u00B0C). CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV is considered an epidemic in Saudi Arabia. The frequency of cases and deaths is higher among men than women, and those above 45 years of age are most affected. Low relative humidity and high temperature can enhance the spread of this disease in the entire population. Further analytical studies are required to determine the source and mode of infection in Saudi Arabia.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alghamdi, Ibrahim G; Hussain, Issam I; Almalki, Shaia S; Alghamdi, Mohamed S; Alghamdi, Mansour M; El-Sheemy, Mohammed A","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/734f6b97fbdf729498fe7077f74f49db8311d2b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4149400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187734/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s67061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["deaths","frequency of cases","MERS-CoV cases","highest number of cases","Saudi Arabia","MERS-CoV infection","highest case fatality rate","years of age","women","years age groups","high temperature","Eastern Region","low relative humidity","humidity of infected regions","Disease occurrence","Saudi Ministry of Health","average monthly temperature","mode of infection","study period","epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","environments","data","people","Epidemiological analysis","source","sex","spread","epidemic","Riyadh","PATIENTS","METHODS","Jeddah","entire population","PURPOSE","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSION","analytical studies","Medinah","Najran","addition"],"language":"en"},

Avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 are potential pandemic candidates. Infection of humans with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is associated with a mortality in excess of 60%, which has been attributed to dysregulation of the cytokine system. Human macrophages and epithelial cells infected with some genotypes of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses express markedly elevated cytokine and chemokine levels when compared with seasonal influenza A subtype H1N1 virus. The mechanisms underlying this cytokine and chemokine hyperinduction are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophagy, a tightly regulated homeostatic process for self-digestion of unwanted cellular subcomponents, plays a role in cytokine induction. Autophagy is induced to a greater extent by H9N2/G1, in association with cytokine hyperinduction, compared with H1N1 and the novel pandemic swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 viruses. Using 3-methyladenine to inhibit autophagy and small interfering RNA to silence the autophagy gene, Atg5, we further show that autophagic responses play a role in influenza virus-induced CXCL10 and interferon-\u03B1 expression in primary human blood macrophages. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2010-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, Anna Hing-Yee; Lee, Davy Chun-Wai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Peiris, Malik; Lau, Allan Sik-Yin","journal":"Cellular \u0026 Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48680c8f096d42d9e6d09f711fab46ae08ab89a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4003230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20473322/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2010.25; https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201025.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Avian influenza viruses H5N1","seasonal influenza","influenza pandemics","pathogenic mechanisms of avian influenza viruses","pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus","H9N2 viruses","H1N1 viruses","influenza virus-induced CXCL10","cytokine hyperinduction","elevated cytokine","cytokine system","cytokine induction","novel pandemic swine-origin influenza","autophagy gene","subtype H1N1 virus","role","genotypes of H5N1","chemokine hyperinduction","Human macrophages","chemokine levels","primary human blood macrophages","potential pandemic candidates","interferon-\u03B1 expression","G1","self-digestion of unwanted cellular subcomponents","homeostatic process","small interfering RNA","epithelial cells","new insights","greater extent","autophagic responses","association","results","Atg5","methyladenine","mortality","Infection of humans","present study","dysregulation","excess"],"language":"en"},

Our results reproduce common observed patterns in the dynamics of HIV spreading in communities.","publish_time":"2011-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukwembi, Simon","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/397dba412ee16b2a5c1389c74a9f6fffec8dc99d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126770.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2011.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288085/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437111004535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437111004535","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynamics of HIV","spread of HIV","HIV infectious partners","sexual network","communities","influence of noninfectious HIV positive individuals","individual\u2019s sexual partners","existence of epidemic","analytic results","dynamical model","density of infected population","certain network properties","precise epidemic threshold","finite discrete population of size n","common observed patterns","account","structure","stability","set V"],"language":"en"},

For reproducible quantitative analysis, it is crucial to strongly immobilize proteins on PADs. Conventional techniques for immobilizing proteins on PADs are based on physical adsorption, but proteins can be easily removed by weak physical forces. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure the reproducibility of the analytical results of PADs using physical adsorption. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we showed a method of covalent binding of proteins to cellulose paper. This method consists of three steps, which include periodate oxidation of paper, the formation of a Schiff base, and reductive amination. We identified aldehyde and imine groups formed on paper using FT-IR analysis. This covalent bonding approach enhanced the binding force and binding capacity of proteins. We confirmed the activity of an immobilized antibody through a sandwich immunoassay. We expect that this immobilization method will contribute to the commercialization of PADs with high reproducibility and sensitivity.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Woogyeong; Jeong, Seong-Geun; Shim, Gyurak; Kim, Dae Young; Pack, Seung Pil; Lee, Chang-Soo","journal":"Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5ed6a43727349c90b95934399c7564c68aa8714.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218682/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12257-018-0430-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["method of covalent binding of proteins","binding capacity of proteins","commercialization of PADs","immobilizing proteins","analytical results of PADs","cellulose paper","physical adsorption","binding force","periodate oxidation of paper","immobilization method","weak physical forces","high reproducibility","analytical devices","covalent bonding approach","FT-IR analysis","reproducible quantitative analysis","formation","Schiff base","immobilized antibody","imine groups","Conventional techniques","sandwich immunoassay","reductive amination","steps","aldehyde","sensitivity","fields","activity","study","limitation"],"language":"en"},

C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822\u2013C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell\u2013cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833.

The HRV pathogenic role in four groups of hospitalized patients (pediatric immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, and adult immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients) was investigated by quantifying HRV load in nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage samples by real\u2010time reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR). Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR was performed in duplicate on all respiratory samples resulting positive by qualitative RT\u2010PCR. In addition, molecular typing allowed detection of all known HRV species (A, B, and C). In immunocompetent pediatric patients HRVs were mostly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (in the absence of other viral agents) and wheezing, when viral load was \u226510(6) RNA copies/ml. In young immunocompromised patients (stem cell transplantation recipients), an inverse correlation between HRV persistence over time and time at which the infection occurred after transplantation was observed, whereas in adult immunocompromised patients (lung transplant recipients) HRVs could be detected at a medium\u2013low level (\u003C10(5) RNA copies/ml) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken routinely from asymptomatic patients. In conclusion, when detected at high viral load, HRVs may cause severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, whereas when detected at a medium\u2013low viral load, an event more frequent in immunocompromised subjects, they may represent only bystander viruses.

Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota plays a role in disease progression and severity, but long-term and international multicenter assessment of the variations in viral and bacterial communities as drivers of exacerbations are lacking. METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P \u003C 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P \u003C 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event. Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR \u003E 0.17; P \u003C 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency (OR \u003E 0.39; P \u003C 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung.

The constant evolution of microorganisms magnifies the problem as it facilitates the re-emergence of old infectious diseases as well as promote the introduction of new and more deadly variants. Evidently, infectious diseases have contributed to an alarming rate of mortality worldwide making it a growing concern. Historically, antibodies have been used successfully to prevent and treat infectious diseases since the nineteenth century using antisera collected from immunized animals. The inherent ability of antibodies to trigger effector mechanisms aids the immune system to fight off pathogens that invades the host. Immune libraries have always been an important source of antibodies for infectious diseases due to the skewed repertoire generated post infection. Even so, the role and ability of na\u00EFve antibody libraries should not be underestimated. The na\u00EFve repertoire has its own unique advantages in generating antibodies against target antigens.

Metagenomic approaches are increasingly used in the detection of novel viral pathogens but also to generate complete genomes of uncultivated viruses. In silico identification of complete viral genomes from sequence data would allow rapid phylogenetic characterization of these new viruses. Often, however, complete viral genomes are not recovered, but rather several distinct contigs derived from a single entity are, some of which have no sequence homology to any known proteins. De novo assembly of single viruses from a metagenome is challenging, not only because of the lack of a reference genome, but also because of intrapopulation variation and uneven or insufficient coverage. Here we explored different assembly algorithms, remote homology searches, genome-specific sequence motifs, k-mer frequency ranking, and coverage profile binning to detect and obtain viral target genomes from metagenomes. All methods were tested on 454-generated sequencing datasets containing three recently described RNA viruses with a relatively large genome which were divergent to previously known viruses from the viral families Rhabdoviridae and Coronaviridae. Depending on specific characteristics of the target virus and the metagenomic community, different assembly and in silico gap closure strategies were successful in obtaining near complete viral genomes.","publish_time":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smits, Saskia L.; Bodewes, Rogier; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Baumg\u00E4rtner, Wolfgang; Koopmans, Marion P.; Osterhaus, Albert D.

However, few studies regarding the epidemiology of hospitalizations for RSV infection have been performed previously in China. Here, we aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection in eastern China. Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients using a broad case definition based on symptoms was performed from 2009\u20132013 in 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. Clinical and epidemiologic data pertaining to hospitalized patients of all ages with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection by PCR assay were collected and analyzed in this study. From 2009 to 2013, 1046 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were enrolled in this study, and 14.7% of patients had subtype A, 24.2% of patients had subtype B, 23.8% of patients with subtype not performed, and 37.3% of patients had RSV coinfections with other viruses. RSV and influenza coinfections (33.3%) were the most common coinfections noted in this study. Moreover, young children aged \u003C5 years (89.1%, 932/1046), particularly young infants aged \u003C1 year (43.3%, 453/1046), represented the highest proportion of patients with RSV infections. In contrast, older adults aged \u226560 years (1.1%, 12/1046) represented the lowest proportion of patients with RSV infections among enrolled patients. The peak RSV infection period occurred mainly during autumn and winter, and 57% and 66% of patients exhibited symptoms such as fever (body temperature \u226538\u00B0C) and cough separately. Additionally, only a small number of patients were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and most of patients were treated with antimicrobial drugs that were not appropriate for RSV infection. RSV is a leading viral pathogen and a common cause of viral infection in young children aged \u003C5 years with ALRIs in eastern China. Effective vaccines and antiviral agents targeting RSV are needed to mitigate its large public health impact.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Dawei; Feng, Luzhao; Chen, Yu; Lai, Shengjie; Zhang, Zike; Yu, Fei; Zheng, Shufa; Li, Zhongjie; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3f9d6933e737f7f0a7bd27a54a9bb4882eca041.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5089734.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ALRI","PCR"],"locations":["China","eastern China"],"keyphrases":["RSV infections","enrolled patients","RSV coinfections","hospitalized ALRI patients","highest proportion of patients","lowest proportion of patients","peak RSV infection period","small number of patients","epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients","years","eastern China","common cause of viral infection","laboratory","young children","study","common coinfections","older adults","ALRIs","symptoms","young infants","influenza coinfections","subtype B","acute lower respiratory infections","leading viral pathogen","leading cause of morbidity","broad-spectrum antiviral drugs","antiviral agents","antimicrobial drugs","epidemiologic data pertaining","Respiratory syncytial virus","broad case definition","ages","body temperature","mortality","fever","Effective vaccines","Active surveillance","epidemiology of hospitalizations","autumn","large public health impact","PCR assay","sentinel hospitals","viruses","studies","winter","contrast","cough"],"language":"en"},

Our findings suggest that recombinant rLa-MERS-S may be a potential MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine candidate for camels and other animals affected by MERS.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"LIU, Ren-qiang; GE, Jin-ying; WANG, Jin-ling; SHAO, Yu; ZHANG, Hui-lei; WANG, Jin-liang; WEN, Zhi-yuan; BU, Zhi-gao","journal":"Journal of Integrative Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/399ad090293d88da72a192acfa03c4e77cda6d9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311917616605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288953/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095311917616605; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(17)61660-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant rLa-MERS","S induced MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV S protein","potential MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine candidate","Bactrian camels","mice","LaSota strain","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recombinant nonvirulent Newcastle disease virus","NDV","animal immunization studies","embryonated chicken eggs","pneumonia","antibodies","similar growth properties","high fever","ARDS","Coronaviridae family","causative pathogen","approved treatment regimens","vaccines","animals","member","immunogenicity","findings","results","extrapulmonary manifestations"],"language":"en"},

However, there is a lack of research on whether this scoring system can be applied to viral community acquired pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PSI in viral community acquired pneumonia. This retrospective cohort study included 1,434 adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital during 2013\u20132015 because of community-acquired pneumonia. Viral infections were diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Patients diagnosed with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia were included in the control group (N = 1,173). The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate the risk of death. Respiratory viruses were detected in 261 (18.2%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Two types of respiratory viruses were detected in 7 cases. Of the 254 cases detected with only one virus, 62 were influenza A, 18 were influenza B, 65 were rhinovirus, 35 were respiratory syncytial virus, 25 were metapneumovirus, 20 were parainfluenza, 17 were coronavirus, 7 were bocavirus, and 5 were adenovirus. Mortality was not significantly different between patients with respiratory virus and those without respiratory virus; the 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 20.3% and 22.4%, respectively (P = 0.45). Mortality rate increased with an increasing PSI score with or without respiratory viral infection. Pulmonary severity index was significantly associated with mortality adjusted for respiratory virus detection (hazard ratio = 1.024, 95% confidence interval = 1.020\u20131.028). Pneumonia severity index score is an important factor for assessing the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, regardless of respiratory virus detection.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Mi-Ae; Park, Jae Seok; Lee, Choong Won; Choi, Won-Il","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/850295bc1049a0609b4568610f3b27bf9a150878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6402623.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of community","respiratory virus detection","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory viral infection","Pneumonia severity index score","non-viral community","types of respiratory viruses","adult patients","prognosis of patients","Viral infections","Pulmonary severity index","day all-cause mortality rates","increasing PSI score","usefulness of PSI","important scoring system","cases","important factor","influenza B","retrospective cohort study","hazard ratio","rhinovirus","metapneumovirus","university hospital","main outcome","multivariate Cox regression analyses","emergency department","confidence interval","multiplex PCR","years","control group","admission status","lack of research","bocavirus","coronavirus","parainfluenza","risk of death","adenovirus","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).

In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors. CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.

Both mutation and nature selection pressure have contributed to this low codon usage bias, with the former being the main determining factor.

In addition, viral and human interactome analyses indicate that different viruses target common, central human proteins for entering cellular signaling pathways and machineries which might constitute powerful broad-spectrum antiviral targets.","publish_time":"2012-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma-Lauer, Yue; Lei, Jian; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; von Brunn, Albrecht","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a064bd64d1ddcf3be61dcb37334fd7a71ddd788a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102765.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712001381; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23057872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712001381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular proteins","individual viral proteins","central human proteins","interactions","pathways","specific cellular antiviral drug target candidates","different viruses","human interactome analyses","powerful broad-spectrum antiviral targets","respective data help","bioinformatical analysis","high-throughput technologies","host cell","proteomics","function","machineries","constant control","knowledge","genes","addition","consequences","combination of transcriptomics","hosts","key questions","virology","pathogenicity"],"language":"en"},

These factors include aerosol generation, particle sizes and concentrations, organism viability, infectivity and virulence, airflow and climate, and environmental sampling and analysis. The major focus on attention to engineering controls comes from recent increases in tuberculosis, particularly the multidrug-resistant varieties in the general hospital population, the severely immunocompromised, and those in at-risk and confined environments such as prisons, long-term care facilities, and shelters for the homeless. Many workers are in close contact with persons who have active, undiagnosed, or insufficiently treated tuberculosis. Additionally, patients and health care workers may be exposed to a variety of pathogenic human viruses, opportunistic fungi, and bacteria. This report therefore focuses on the nature of infectious aerosol transmission in an attempt to determine which factors can be systematically addressed to result in proven, applied engineering approaches to the control of infectious aerosols in hospital and health care facility environments. The infectious aerosols of consideration are those that are generated as particles of respirable size by both human and environmental sources and that have the capability of remaining viable and airborne for extended periods in the indoor environment. This definition precludes skin and mucous membrane exposures occurring from splashes (rather than true aerosols) of blood or body fluids containing infectious disease agents. There are no epidemiologic or laboratory studies documenting the transmission of bloodborne virus by way of aerosols.

We reviewed the existing literature from 2007 to April 2013 and expert opinions about clinician engagement and education for critical care during a pandemic or disaster and offer suggestions for integrating ICU clinicians into planning and response. The suggestions in this article are important for all of those involved in a pandemic or large-scale disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed and suggestions formulated according to the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Consensus Statement development methodology. We assessed articles, documents, reports, and gray literature reported since 2007. Following expert-informed sorting and review of the literature, key priority areas and questions were developed. No studies of sufficient quality were identified upon which to make evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS: Twenty-three suggestions were formulated based on literature-informed consensus opinion. These suggestions are grouped according to the following thematic elements: (1) situational awareness, (2) clinician roles and responsibilities, (3) education, and (4) community engagement. Together, these four elements are considered to form the basis for effective ICU clinician engagement for mass critical care. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal engagement of the ICU clinical team in caring for large numbers of critically ill patients due to a pandemic or disaster will require a departure from the routine independent systems operating in hospitals. An effective response will require robust information systems; coordination among clinicians, hospitals, and governmental organizations; pre-event engagement of relevant stakeholders; and standardized core competencies for the education and training of critical care clinicians.","publish_time":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devereaux, Asha V.; Tosh, Pritish K.; Hick, John L.; Hanfling, Dan; Geiling, James; Reed, Mary Jane; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Shah, Umair A.; Fagbuyi, Daniel B.; Skippen, Peter; Dichter, Jeffrey R.; Kissoon, Niranjan; Christian, Michael D.; Upperman, Jeffrey S.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/513bafef235c8b1a15690cbd81f6b7f5ca60f250.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4b2f7ae032c121d9de4cda09aa92b6eac5bc0a7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4504247.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-0740; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215519946; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215519946; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4504247?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["education of ICU clinicians","effective ICU clinician engagement","optimal engagement","community engagement","expert opinion-based suggestions","front-line clinicians","training of critical care clinicians","disaster preparedness","large-scale disaster","pandemic","gray literature","existing literature","literature-informed consensus opinion","systematic literature review","mass critical care","ICU clinical team","pre-event engagement of relevant stakeholders","ill patients","clinician roles","hospitals","effective response","expert opinions","expert-informed sorting","evidence-based recommendations","following thematic elements","injured patients","robust information systems","routine independent systems","American College of Chest Physicians","Consensus Statement development methodology","large numbers","governmental organizations","hospital administrators","standardized core competencies","caring","public health","time constraints","coordination","departure","basis","key priority areas","modified Delphi process","documents","reports","questions","situational awareness","panel","planning","government officials","institutional barriers","METHODS","responsibilities","BACKGROUND","studies of sufficient quality","articles","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the present paper, groups of dogs were vaccinated twice with a commercial bacterin (EURICAN\u00AE L) containing Leptospira interrogans serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola and challenged with heterologous representatives of both serovars at 2 weeks (onset of immunity) or 14 months (duration of immunity) after the second vaccination. Control dogs were not vaccinated against leptospirosis and kept with the vaccinated dogs. The challenges, irrespective of the serovar, reliably produced clinical signs consistent with Leptospira infection in the control pups with up to 60% mortality. As expected clinical disease in the adult controls was less severe, but we were able to induce morbidity and mortality as well. Under these extreme challenge conditions, clinical signs in the vaccinated dogs were rare, and when observed, mild and transient in nature. Following experimental infection, 100% of the control pups and 83% of the adult controls became renal carriers. Despite the heavy challenges, none of the 18 vaccinated puppies (onset of immunity studies) and only 2 out of the 16 vaccinated adult dogs (duration of immunity studies) developed a renal carrier state. These results show that a primary course of two doses of EURICAN\u00AE L provided quick onset and long-term protection against both clinical leptospirosis and the renal carrier stage.

While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.","publish_time":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicolaides, Christos; Avraam, Demetris; Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis; Gonzalez, Marta C.; Juanes, Ruben","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7013728128512f3a382b72e35c6a2b36139b5a0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8eef6fec694446e150e95dfbef3a3579ae8806d3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/530618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Centres for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of hand","impact of different hand","hand cleanliness","effectiveness of hand hygiene","different airports","effect of hand washing","world pandemic","key airports","spread of diseases","World Health Organization","global pandemic","global spread of infectious diseases","mitigation strategies","mitigation strategy","world air transportation traffic","world air transportation network","different locations","global epidemic","potential pandemic","public-health research","way public-health policymakers","hygiene behavioural changes of airport population","behavioral changes","individual transmissibility","Disease Control","cost-effective way","epidemic outbreak","Monte-Carlo simulation study","new effective strategies","detailed individual mobility model","waiting-time distributions of individuals","recurrent nature of human travel","contagion dynamics","important implications","core","early stages","cost-optimal deployment","granular dataset","Prevention","Centres","evidence","CDC","engagement rate","contribution"],"language":"en"},

However, determinants of childhood bronchial reactivity, a key feature of asthma, are largely unknown. Aim of this study was to determine how patient characteristics during the first severe virus-induced wheezing episode are associated with pulmonary function at pre-school age. METHODS: Study consisted of 76 children presenting with their first wheezing episode at the ages of 3 to 23 months. At study entry, viral etiology, rhinovirus genome load, atopic and clinical characteristics, and standardized questionnaire were analyzed. At 4-year follow-up visit, impulse oscillometry with exercise challenge was performed. RESULTS: At study entry, the mean age of the children was 12 months (SD 6.0), 57 (75%) were rhinovirus positive and 22 (30%) were sensitized. At follow-up visit four years later, the mean age of the children was 60 months (SD 7.9) and 37 (49%) were using asthma medication regularly (discontinued before testing in 25 [68%] children).

This article is focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and control of common and emerging viral diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"International Encyclopedia of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46e667308e192a97123a625605b5f8763b8601af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150291.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128036785005142; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128036785005142","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of common","nucleic acid genome","infection control measures","laboratory diagnosis","viral infections","Abstract Viruses","common disinfectants","availability of rapid nucleic acid amplification assays","emerging viral diseases","effective antivirals","simple structure","obligatory intracellular pathogens","assembled proteins","time-honored surveillance","safe vaccines","epidemiology","lipid envelope","article"],"language":"en"},

The syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death. The virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the 1980s. Therefore, dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection. Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area. Here, we developed four vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV based on ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, two candidates per vector. All vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of MERS-CoV; ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) where MVA MERS vaccines were produced with tPA, but either the mH5 or F11 promoter driving expression of the spike gene. All vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime-boost regimens. ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced higher neutralising antibodies than ChAdOx1 MERS without tPA. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA elicited cellular immune responses as well as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by MVA MERS. The humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA was equivalent to two doses of MVA MERS (also with tPA). MVA MERS with mH5 or F11 promoter induced similar antibody levels; however, F11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS to significantly higher magnitudes. In conclusion, our study showed that MERS-CoV vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising different viral vectors, various genetic designs of the vectors, or different regimens to increase immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 and MVA vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these MERS vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2017-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Padron-Regalado, Eriko; Thompson, Craig P.; Kupke, Alexandra; Wells, Daniel; Sloan, Megan A.; Grehan, Keith; Temperton, Nigel; Lambe, Teresa; Warimwe, George; Becker, Stephan; Hill, Adrian V.S.; Gilbert, Sarah C.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3c5dbfd682af9f81d55a8feda2e808a0b4f22a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5516308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579232/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17306564; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17306564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVA","MVA MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines","MVA MERS vaccines","MERS vaccine candidates","doses of MVA MERS","tPA","MERS-CoV vaccine candidates","cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS","single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS","full-length spike gene of MERS","MVA vectored vaccines","MVA viral vectors","F11 promoter","dromedary camels","different viral vectors","higher neutralising antibodies","mH5","higher level","higher magnitudes","different regimens","humoral immunogenicity","humans","prime-boost regimens","syndrome ranges","human tissue plasminogen activator gene","cellular immune responses","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mild cases","various genetic designs","similar antibody levels","active research","severe pneumonia","medical use","expression","leader sequence","mouse model","death","study","area","animal source of infection","notable symptoms","antiviral drugs","clinical trials","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

There was an abysmal drop of the Spanish yearly population growth curve as families could not afford having children in that economic context, only worsening the already existing demographic problems: Spain has a constantly ageing population and one of the lowest fertility indicators in Europe. Taking into consideration that female age is the most important independent variable of success at the time of conception, probably thousands of potentially fertile couples were lost while waiting for more promising circumstances. With the COVID-19 pandemic we are facing a similar situation, where reproductive rights are imperiled by not being able to choose when to have children due to economic coercion.

Furthermore, thanks to the collaboration with colleagues from different specialties (Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine), dedicated areas for COVID patients were activated.

A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)\u2013mediated host\u2013virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the \u201CBASC\u2013microRNome\u201D with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA\u2013mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors, miRNAs, and BASCs in SARS pathway, which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall interplay leading to disease progression. Our observation reveals the BASCs (Sca-1\u002B CD34\u002B CD45- Pecam-), a subset of Oct-4\u002B ACE2\u002B epithelial colony cells at the broncho-alveolar duct junction, to be the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection. Upregulated BASC miRNAs-17*, -574-5p, and -214 are co-opted by SARS-CoV to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place. Viral Nucleocapsid and Spike protein targets seem to co-opt downregulated miR-223 and miR-98 respectively within BASCs to control the various stages of BASC differentiation, activation of inflammatory chemokines, and downregulation of ACE2.

Passive desiccant wheels are usually applied as an energy saving technique for vapor-compression cooling systems, unburdening the cooling coil from handling the humidity of outside ventilation air stream. In contrast, active desiccant wheels are designed to promote a thorough dehumidification of outside ventilation air, many times allowing for the use of an evaporative cooler and achieving an appreciable cooling effect, using only water as the refrigerant. The present work is comprised of a comparative study of the roles played by heat and mass transfer in passive and active adsorptive air dehumidification.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort study using prospectively collected data from adult patients hospitalized during influenza virus circulation, for at least 24h, for community-acquired ILI (with symptom onset \u003C7 days). Data were collected from five French teaching hospitals over six consecutive winters (2012-2018). Respiratory viruses were identified by multiplex RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. hMPV\u002B patients were compared to hMPV\u2013 patients, influenza\u002B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u002B patients using multivariate logistic regressions. Primary outcome was the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized for ILI. RESULTS: Among the 3148 patients included (1449 (46%) women, 1988 (63%) aged 65 and over; 2508 (80%) with chronic disease), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 1604 (51%, 95%CI [49-53]), including 100 cases of hMPV (100/3148, 3% 95%CI [3, 4]), of which 10 (10%) were viral co-infection. In the hMPV\u002B patients, mean length of stay was 7 days, 62% (56/90) developed a complication, 21% (14/68) were admitted to intensive care unit and 4% (4/90) died during hospitalization. In comparison with influenza\u002B patients, hMPV\u002B patients were more frequently \u003E 65 years old (aOR=3.3, 95%CI[1.9-6.3]) and presented more acute heart failure during hospitalization (aOR=1.8, 95%CI[1.0-2.9]). Compared to RSV\u002B patients, hMPV\u002B patients had less cancer (aOR=0.4, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) and were less likely to smoke (aOR=0.5, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) but had similar outcomes especially high rate of respiratory and cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Adult hMPV infections mainly affect the elderly and patients with chronic conditions and are responsible for frequent cardiac and pulmonary complications similar to those of RSV infections. At-risk populations would benefit from the development of antivirals and vaccines targeting hMPV.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loubet, Paul; Mathieu, Pauline; Lenzi, Nezha; Galtier, Florence; Lain\u00E9, Fabrice; Lesieur, Zineb; Vanhems, Philippe; Duval, Xavier; Postil, Deborah; Amour, S\u00E9lilah; Rogez, Sylvie; Lagathu, Gis\u00E8le; L\u0027Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Foulongne, Vincent; Houhou, Nadhira; Lina, Bruno; Carrat, Fabrice; Launay, Odile","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba498f505c74a29959cda94f0b6f8d1272f19131.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195031.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20301907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283266/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20301907?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult patients","prevalence of hMPV","cases of hMPV","Adult hMPV infections","aOR","RSV infections","ILI","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza virus circulation","Respiratory viruses","pulmonary complications similar","cardiovascular complications","high rate of respiratory","data","days","hospitalization","complications of human metapneumovirus","similar outcomes","chronic conditions","chronic disease","multiplex RT-PCR","multicenter cohort study","retrospective","clinical features","French teaching hospitals","mean length of stay","consecutive winters","nasopharyngeal specimens","development of antivirals","acute heart failure","population of adults","cancer","multivariate logistic regressions","symptom onset","community","vaccines","illness","Primary outcome","years old","CONCLUSIONS","comparison","viral co-infection","intensive care unit","At-risk populations","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","women"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we examined the prognostic values of the SARS\u2010associated proteomic features by biostatistical analysis, and deciphered the identities of those with prognostic values. Data of 20 SARS\u2010associated serum proteomic features and ten serological variables from 38 SARS adult patients before treatment were subjected to multivariate logistic regression. Proteomic features of m/z 6634, m/z 7769, m/z 8635, and m/z 8865 were identified as independent prognostic markers. After purification by cation\u2010exchange chromatography and gel electrophoresis, proteomic features of m/z 7769 and m/z 8865 were found to be platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta\u2010thromboglobulin (beta\u2010TG) by tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The associations of decreased serum PF4 and increased serum beta\u2010TG levels with poor prognosis were confirmed by Western blot. Previous studies suggest that PF4 and beta\u2010TG are involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a negative and positive way, respectively.

The cause for the relatively abnormal growth of tonsils and adenoids is poorly understood. METHODS: Non-acutely ill children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T\u0026A) for various reasons were enrolled prospectively in a study to determine the frequency of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in each lymphoid tissue and to relate the number and types of virus to the degree of airway obstruction. Molecular techniques were used to detect 9 respiratory viruses while Brodsky scores and measurements of percentages airway obstruction were used to estimate the degree of airway compromise due to the tonsil and adenoid, respectively. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 70.9% of tonsils and 94.7% of adenoids, p \u003C 0.001. Adenovirus was the most common virus detected at 71.1%. Adenoids had an average of 2.4 viruses compared to 0.92 for tonsils, p \u003C 0.001. Higher Brodsky scores were only associated with EBV in tonsils, p = 0.03, while greater percentages of airway obstruction in the adenoids were associated with adenovirus, EBV, corona virus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus, p \u2264 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic viral infections are common and directly related to the degree of airway obstruction significantly more often in adenoids than tonsils.","publish_time":"2016-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faden, Howard; Callanan, Vincent; Pizzuto, Michael; Nagy, Mark; Wilby, Mark; Lamson, Daryl; Wrotniak, Brian; Juretschko, Stefan; St George, Kirsten","journal":"Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb089bab59a64d77a1c72d717e5edd72b06e4ba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132388.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587616303068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27729119/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2016.09.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587616303068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brodsky","Adenoids"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenoids","degree of airway obstruction","common virus","measurements of percentages airway obstruction","greater percentages of airway obstruction","enlargement of tonsils","abnormal growth of tonsils","corona virus","parainfluenza virus","types of virus","respiratory viruses","Asymptomatic viral infections","EBV","Adenovirus","frequency of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections","common pediatric problem","Higher Brodsky scores","ill children","lymphoid tissue","tonsillectomy","rhinovirus","sleep disordered breathing","adenoidectomy","number","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","study","BACKGROUND","various reasons","cause","average","Molecular techniques","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The possible role of human coronavirus (HCoV) in lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) has not been well studied. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective review of HCT/HM patients with HCoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates were compared among HCT recipients with LRTD caused by HCoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus (PIV) by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS. We identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. Among 23 available BAL samples, 48% were strain OC43, 22% were NL63, 17% were 229E, and 13% were HKU1. Overall, 21 patients (60%) required oxygen therapy at diagnosis and 19 (54%) died within 90 days of diagnosis. Respiratory copathogens were detected in 21 episodes (57%), including viruses (n = 12), fungi (n = 10), and bacteria (n = 8). Mortality rates were not different between patients with and without copathogens (P = .65). In multivariable models, mortality associated with HCoV LRTD was similar to that seen with RSV, influenza, and PIV LRTD in HCT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, .66\u20132.71], P = .41 vs RSV, adjusted for cell source, cytopenia, copathogens, oxygen use, and steroid use). CONCLUSIONS. HCoV LRTD in patients with HCT or HM is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. Mortality associated with HCoV LRTD in HCT recipients appears to be similar to that seen with RSV, influenza virus, and PIV.","publish_time":"2017-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogimi, Chikara; Waghmare, Alpana A.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Xie, Hu; Yeung, Cecilia C.; Leisenring, Wendy M.; Seo, Sachiko; Choi, Su-Mi; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20397f777711bd0749f90d527a2bbe97869e05ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5434339.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28329354/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix160; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/64/11/1532/17844203/cix160.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","LRTD","PIV LRTD","PIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV LRTD","HCT recipients","PIV LRTD","HCoV strains","HM patients","Mortality rates","Respiratory copathogens","retrospective review of HCT","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","vs RSV","high rates of oxygen use","steroid use","available BAL samples","oxygen therapy","episodes","cell source","lower respiratory tract disease","multivariable models","days of diagnosis","hematopoietic cell transplant","adjusted hazard ratio","multivariable Cox regression analysis","strain-specific polymerase chain reaction","cytopenia","possible role of human coronavirus","hematologic malignancies","bronchoalveolar lavage","NL63","OC43","fungi","bacteria","confidence interval","HKU1","viruses","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Virus was applied to the hands of volunteers and sampled by the glove juice method with 1.5% beef extract (BE), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.01 and 0.1% Tween 80, tryptic soy broth (TSB), and 9% NaCl. Each volunteer underwent multiple rounds application and hand sampling. Mean log(10) virus loss across trials was 2.6 for BE, 2.8 for PBS, 2.4 for TSB, 3.8 for NaCl, 3.0 for 0.1% Tween 80, and 2.9 for 0.01% Tween 80. Within each volunteer, there was a decline in viral loss from the first to last trial. CONCLUSIONS: These eluents can recover \u03A66 from hands with ~2-3 log(10) loss, comparable to recoveries previously reported for influenza. Protein and detergent-based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: Based on current work, protein-based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling, providing methods for evaluating survival and transmission of enveloped viruses on hands. Further exploration is needed of the effect of repeated sampling on recovery from whole-hand sampling.","publish_time":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casanova, Lisa M.; Weaver, Scott R.","journal":"Journal of Applied Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6d2e5ddde78b9604728db85917a86205babb514.json; document_parses/pdf_json/198c5c2b4f68876fea0f3a35f9428b7cf009071e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4594860.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.12777; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4594860?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25693048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TSB","PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hand sampling","recovery of enveloped viruses","protein-based eluents","effect of repeated sampling","Tween","detergent-based eluents","virus loss","beef extract","transmission of enveloped viruses","enveloped bacteriophage","\u03A66","METHODS","viral loss","TSB","hands of volunteers","PBS","NaCl","similar recoveries","Mean log","current work","multiple rounds application","survival","glove juice method","phosphate buffered saline","tryptic soy broth","IMPACT","decline","research","SIGNIFICANCE","influenza","RESULTS","trials","CONCLUSIONS","objective","exploration"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we will explore the possibility and pertinence of ARB as a broad-spectrum antiviral, after a careful examination of its physico-chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and molecular mechanisms of action. Recent studies suggest that ARB\u2019s dual interactions with membranes and aromatic amino acids in proteins may be central to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. This could impact on the virus itself, and/or on cellular functions or critical steps in virus-cell interactions, thereby positioning ARB as both a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and a host-targeting agent (HTA).

RESULTS During NIV via a helmet with the simulator programmed in mild lung injury, exhaled air leaked through the neck-helmet interface with a radial distance of 150 to 230 mm when inspiratory positive airway pressure was increased from 12 to 20 cm H2O, respectively, while keeping the expiratory pressure at 10 cm H2O. During NIV via a helmet with air cushion around the neck, there was negligible air leakage. During NIV via a total facemask for mild lung injury, air leaked through the exhalation port to 618 and 812 mm when inspiratory pressure was increased from 10 to 18 cm H2O, respectively, with the expiratory pressure at 5 cm H2O. CONCLUSIONS A helmet with a good seal around the neck is needed to prevent nosocomial infection during NIV for patients with respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, David S.; Chow, Benny K.; Lo, Thomas; Ng, Susanna S.; Ko, Fanny W.; Gin, Tony; Chan, Matthew T.V.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83b125f80f01c2febdc9233e325f95f4310f2ad6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094250.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-1934; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215383598; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215383598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NIV","air changes","air cushion","expiratory pressure","inspiratory pressure","H2O","exhaled air dispersion","total facemask","neck-helmet interface","negligible air leakage","inspiratory positive airway pressure","negative pressure room","respiratory infections","bilevel positive airway pressure device","patients","mild lung injury","respiratory failure","risk of nosocomial infection","intrapulmonary smoke particles","human patient simulator","normalized smoke concentration","option","different helmets","laser light sheet","ventilator","good seal","video camera","BACKGROUND Noninvasive ventilation","radial distance","data analysis","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","exhalation port","RESULTS","Significant exposure"],"language":"en"},

To understand current clinical characteristics and practice, we conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze quality of care on childhood pneumonia in eight eastern cities in China. METHODS: Consecutive hospital records between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010 were collected from 13 traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine (WM) hospitals in February, May, August, and November (25 cases per season, 100 cases over the year), respectively. A predesigned case report form was used to extract data from the hospital medical records. RESULTS: A total of 1298 cases were collected and analyzed. Symptoms and signs upon admission at TCM and WM hospitals were cough (99.3% vs. 98.6%), rales (84.8% vs. 75.0%), phlegm (83.3% vs. 49.1%), and fever (74.9% vs. 84.0%) in frequency. Patients admitted to WM hospitals had symptoms and signs for a longer period prior to admission than patients admitted to TCM hospitals. Testing to identify etiologic agents was performed in 1140 cases (88.4%). Intravenous antibiotics were administered in 99.3% (595/598) of cases in TCM hospitals and in 98.6% (699/700) of cases in WM hospitals. Besides, Chinese herbal extract injection was used more frequently in TCM hospitals (491 cases, 82.1%) than in WM hospitals (212 cases, 30.3%) (p \u003C 0.01). At discharge, 818 cases (63.0%) were clinically cured, with a significant difference between the cure rates in TCM (87.6%) and WM hospitals (42.0%) (OR = 9.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.3 ~ 12.9, p \u003C 0.01). Pathogen and previous medical history were more likely associated with the disappearance of rales (OR = 7.2, 95% CI: 4.8 ~ 10.9). Adverse effects were not reported from the medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous use of antibiotics is highly prevalent in children with community-acquired pneumonia regardless of aetiology. There was difference between TCM and WM hospitals with regard to symptom profile and the use of antibiotics. Intravenous use of herbal injection was higher in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals. Most of the cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms without sufficient confirmation of aetiology. Audit of current practice is urgently needed to improve care.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xue-Feng; Liu, Jian-Ping; Shen, Kun-Ling; Ma, Rong; Cui, Zhen-Ze; Deng, Li; Shang, Yun-Xiao; Zhao, De-Yu; Wang, Li-Bo; Wan, Li-Ya; Sun, Yi-Qiu; Li, Yan-Ning; Jiang, Zhi-Yan; Xu, Hua; Li, Xin-Min; Wu, Zhen-Qi; Liu, Zhao-Lan; Hu, Ying-Hui; Huang, Yan; He, Chun-Hui; Zhang, Han; Jiang, Yong-Hong; Liu, Hua; Wang, Zi","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1e4465687748c1d03b1c648b1558d1051859b5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3880031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24364897/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-13-367","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","WM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["TCM hospitals","WM hospitals","cases","Symptoms","Intravenous use of antibiotics","Intravenous antibiotics","hospital medical records","clinical signs","Intravenous use of herbal injection","admission","childhood pneumonia","children","Patients","Chinese herbal extract injection","Community","China","Consecutive hospital records","traditional Chinese medicine","previous medical history","current clinical characteristics","Audit of current practice","western medicine","quality of care","significant difference","disappearance of rales","sufficient confirmation of aetiology","symptom profile","regard","data","longer period","eastern cities","cross-sectional study","cure rates","predesigned case report form","Pathogen","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","season","cough","confidence interval","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","total","etiologic agents","year","Adverse effects","discharge","phlegm","fever","frequency"],"language":"en"},

However, limited information on the productivity values of gilts and sows infected with PEDV is available. Here, we evaluate the productivity index in gilts and sows during the 1-year period before (19 January 2013 to 18 January 2014) and after (19 January 2014 to 18 January 2015) a PEDV outbreak from a 2000-sow breeding herd in Taiwan. The farrowing rate (FR), return rate (RR), total pigs born per litter (TB), pigs born alive per litter (BA), weaning pigs per litter (WPL), pre-weaning mortality, percentage of sows mated by 7 days after weaning, weaning to first service interval (WFSI), mated female nonproductive days (NPDs), replacement rate of sows and sow culling rate were compared using productive records. The FR (-9.6%), RR (\u002B9.8%), TB (-1.6), BA (-1.1), WPL (-1.1), sows mated by 7 days after weaning (-6.9%), WFSI (\u002B0.8 days), NPDs (\u002B6.9 days) and sow culling rate (\u002B7.2%) were significantly different between the 1-year pre-PEDV outbreak period and the post-PEDV outbreak period.

Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tundo, G.

However, the implementation of health legal preparedness differs between low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and developed countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines recent trends regarding public health legal preparedness for emergencies and discusses its role in the recent Ebola outbreak. DESIGN: A rigorous literature review was conducted using eight electronic databases as well as Google Scholar. The results encompassed peer-reviewed English articles, reports, theses, and position papers dating from 2011 to 2014. Earlier articles concerning regulatory actions were also examined. RESULTS: The importance of PHLP has grown during the past decade and focuses mainly on infection\u2013disease scenarios. Amid LMICs, it mostly refers to application of international regulations, whereas in developed states, it focuses on independent legislation and creation of conditions optimal to promoting an effective emergency management. Among developed countries, the United States\u2019 utilisation of health legal preparedness is the most advanced, including the creation of a model comprising four elements: law, competencies, information, and coordination. Only limited research has been conducted in this field to date. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing states, studies that focused on regulations and laws activated in health systems during emergencies, identified inconsistency and incoherence. The Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa since 2014 has global implications, challenges and paralleling results, that were identified in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The review has shown the need to broaden international regulations, to deepen reciprocity between countries, and to consider LMICs health capacities, in order to strengthen the national health security. Adopting elements of the health legal preparedness model is recommended.","publish_time":"2015-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Odeya; Feder-Bubis, Paula; Bar-Dayan, Yaron; Adini, Bruria","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bfdf7dff1f50821c7fd782b0c6c0b4d56bf1815.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4598337.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449204/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v8.28871","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHLP"],"locations":["Ebola","United States","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Public health legal preparedness","health legal preparedness model","implementation of health legal preparedness","health systems","LMICs health capacities","developed countries","United States\u2019 utilisation of health legal preparedness","health system response","national health security","emergencies","developed states","middle-income countries","elements","application of international regulations","recent Ebola outbreak","paralleling results","rigorous literature review","recent trends","English articles","importance of PHLP","Earlier articles","creation of conditions optimal","reports","global implications","order","independent legislation","core component","theses","West Africa","laws","role","electronic databases","infection","competencies","information","challenges","peer","inconsistency","effective emergency management","BACKGROUND","Google Scholar","position papers","regulatory actions","past decade","OBJECTIVE","DESIGN","studies","need","reciprocity","field","disease scenarios","coordination","incoherence","limited research","date","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with infection and lack of licensed antiviral therapies make the henipaviruses a potential biological threat to humans and livestock. Henipavirus entry is initiated by the attachment of the G envelope glycoprotein to host cell membrane receptors. Previously, henipavirus-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) have been isolated using the HeV-G glycoprotein and a human na\u00EFve antibody library. One cross-reactive and receptor-blocking hmAb (m102.4) was recently demonstrated to be an effective post-exposure therapy in two animal models of NiV and HeV infection, has been used in several people on a compassionate use basis, and is currently in development for use in humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of the complex of HeV-G with m102.3, an m102.4 derivative, and describe NiV and HeV escape mutants. This structure provides detailed insight into the mechanism of HeV and NiV neutralization by m102.4, and serves as a blueprint for further optimization of m102.4 as a therapeutic agent and for the development of entry inhibitors and vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Kai; Rockx, Barry; Xie, Yihu; DeBuysscher, Blair L.; Fusco, Deborah L.; Zhu, Zhongyu; Chan, Yee-Peng; Xu, Yan; Luu, Truong; Cer, Regina Z.; Feldmann, Heinz; Mokashi, Vishwesh; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.; Broder, Christopher C.; Nikolov, Dimitar B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dbdecefcd59460800cc11324be0595779ffde80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3795035.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Southeast Asia","India","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["HeV infection","HeV-G glycoprotein","mechanism of HeV","complex of HeV","optimization of m102","HeV escape mutants","NiV neutralization","animal models of NiV","G envelope glycoprotein","henipaviruses","humans","hmAb","Henipavirus entry","development of entry inhibitors","crystal structure","human monoclonal antibodies","compassionate use basis","broad host tropisms responsible","human na\u00EFve antibody library","repeated outbreaks","Australia","pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses","Southeast Asia","lack of licensed antiviral therapies","potential biological threat","effective post-exposure therapy","mortality rates","attachment","cell membrane receptors","India","livestock","detailed insight","Nipah","high morbidity","therapeutic agent","Bangladesh","people","vaccines","Hendra","derivative","blueprint"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on an abnormal ciliary beat frequency, accompanied by specific abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. It is unknown whether determining ciliary beat pattern related to specific ultrastructural ciliary defects might help in the diagnosis of PCD. Objective We sought to determine ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency (CBF) associated with the 5 common ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD. Methods Nasal brushings were performed on 56 children with PCD. Ciliary movement was recorded using digital high-speed video imaging to assess beat frequency and pattern. Electron microscopy was performed. Results In patients with an isolated outer dynein arm or with an outer and inner dynein arm defect, 55% and 80% of cilia were immotile, respectively. Cilia that moved were only flickering. Mean CBF (\u00B1 95% CI) was 2.3 Hz (\u00B1 1.2) and 0.8 Hz(\u00B1 0.8), respectively. Cilia with an isolated inner dynein arm or a radial spoke defect had similar beat patterns. Cilia appeared stiff, had a reduced amplitude, and failed to bend along their length. Immotile cilia were present in 10% of cilia with an inner dynein arm defect and in 30% of radial spoke defects. Mean CBF was 9.3 Hz (\u00B1 2.6) and 6.0 Hz (\u00B1 3.1), respectively. The ciliary transposition defect produced a large circular beat pattern (mean CBF, 10.7 Hz [\u00B1 1.1]). No cilia were immotile. Conclusions Different ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD result in predictable beat patterns. Recognition of these might help in the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having PCD.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chilvers, Mark A; Rutman, Andrew; O\u0027Callaghan, Christopher","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e252011f335ba94d7f6f4e34693c6707bfe18da4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126607.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674903017998; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674903017998","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cilia"],"organizations":["PCD","CBF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ciliary beat pattern","abnormal ciliary beat frequency","Immotile cilia","Hz","Ciliary movement","ciliary axoneme","ciliary transposition defect","specific ultrastructural ciliary defects","diagnosis of PCD","inner dynein arm defect","predictable beat patterns","similar beat patterns","large circular beat pattern","PCD result","Mean CBF","isolated inner dynein arm","isolated outer dynein arm","radial spoke defects","common ultrastructural defects responsible","main symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia","Conclusions Different ultrastructural defects responsible","specific abnormalities","nasal rhinorrhea","Methods Nasal brushings","diagnostic evaluation of patients","digital high-speed video imaging","blockage","Abstract Background","moist-sounding cough","Results","children","reduced amplitude","Objective","Electron microscopy","length","Recognition"],"language":"en"},

There are 5 genetically and antigenically distinct species within the genus Ebolavirus. Limited cross-reactivity and protection is observed between these 5 Ebolavirus species, which complicates vaccine development. However, on the basis of sequence homology between the 5 Ebolavirus species, we hypothesize that conserved epitopes are present on the viral glycoprotein (GP), which can be targeted by antibodies. In the current study, a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies was isolated and characterized using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine cross-reactivity, avidity, and competition for epitope binding; Western blot analysis was also performed. Four monoclonal antibodies were identified by ELISA as cross-reacting with the GPs of all 5 Ebolavirus species. The identification of cross-reactive antibodies that bind the GPs of all known Ebolavirus species will give us important insight into the presence of conserved epitopes on the viral GP. These data will be crucial for the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostic assays.","publish_time":"2015-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hernandez, Humberto; Marceau, Caleb; Halliday, Hailey; Callison, Julie; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Escaffre, Olivier; Creech, Jeffrey; Feldmann, Heinz; Rockx, Barry","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4564547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25999057/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv209; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/212/suppl_2/S410/18083679/jiv209.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["known Ebolavirus species","genus Ebolavirus","distinct species","ELISA","GPs","viral GP","panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies","Limited cross-reactivity","identification of cross-reactive antibodies","presence of conserved epitopes","viral glycoprotein","vaccine development","development of novel therapeutics","epitope binding","competition","important insight","largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus infection","avidity","Western blot analysis","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","diagnostic assays","protection","current study","basis of sequence homology","cases","data","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Molecular POC tests could be a valuable alternative. Objectives To evaluate the first influenza molecular POC test commercially available, the Cepheid Xpert Flu A Panel designed to simultaneously detect influenza A virus and subtype A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus, and compare it with in-house real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Study design Clinical specimens positive for influenza virus and influenza virus isolates with different viral loads and of different type and subtype were used to determine the analytical reactivity and sensitivity. A panel of pathogen negative specimens and isolates of 19 different respiratory pathogens were used to determine the analytical specificity. Results Except A(H9N2) virus the Xpert Flu A Panel detected A(H1N1) seasonal and 2009 pandemic, A(H3N2), A(H5N2), A(H5N1) and A(H7N7) viruses and correctly subtyped A(H1N1) 2009 virus. Analytical sensitivity was similar to qRT-PCR in the range of 400\u20135000 viral particles per ml. However, of most subtypes some specimens with cycle threshold values greater than 30 in qRT-PCR and A(H1N1) 2009 specimens with inconsistent results in the qRT-PCR due to primer or probe mismatches were not detected in the Xpert Flu A Panel. Analytical specificity was 100%. Conclusions The Xpert Flu A Panel is the first commercially available POC molecular test for detection of influenza A virus and determination of the H1 2009 subtype and is analytically reasonable sensitive compared with qRT-PCR and highly specific and therefore a welcome alternative to antigenic POC tests.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jenny, Shireen L.; Hu, Yaobi; Overduin, Pieter; Meijer, Adam","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2882f37917b6c8f2061da45bd1b58f467ac5cff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20674478/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210002726; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210002726; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.07.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC","Cepheid Xpert Flu A Panel","PCR","Xpert Flu A Panel"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus isolates","qRT-PCR","pandemic virus","influenza molecular POC test","detection of influenza","H1N1","Molecular POC tests","antigenic POC tests","individual reliable diagnosis of influenza virus infections","available POC molecular test","Analytical sensitivity","analytical specificity","panel of pathogen negative specimens","Cepheid Xpert","Abstract Background Influenza antigenic point","analytical reactivity","in-house real-time RT-PCR","different viral loads","different type","different respiratory pathogens","Study design Clinical specimens positive","welcome alternative","valuable alternative","inconsistent results","viral particles","cycle threshold values greater","additional laboratory confirmation","determination","care","reasonable sensitive","subtypes","primer","range","probe mismatches","H7N7","viruses","H9N2","H5N2","H5N1","H3N2","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Some of them can block the interaction of viral glycoproteins to the host cell receptors acting as antiviral agents. Although cyanobacterial lectins have presented broad biotechnological potential, little research has been directed to Amazonian Cyanobacterial diversity. In order to identify new antiviral lectins, we performed genomic analysis in seven cyanobacterial strains from Cole\u00E7\u00E3o Amaz\u00F4nica de Cianobact\u00E9rias e Microalgas (CACIAM). We found 75 unique CDS presenting one or more lectin domains. Since almost all were annotated as hypothetical proteins, we used homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the structural and functional properties of three CDS that were more similar to known antiviral lectins. Nostoc sp. CACIAM 19 as well as Tolypothrix sp. CACIAM 22 strains presented cyanovirin\u2010N homologues whose function was confirmed by binding free energy calculations. Asn, Glu, Thr, Lys, Leu, and Gly, which were described as binding residues for cyanovirin, were also observed on those structures. As for other known cyanovirins, those residues in both our models also made favorable interactions with dimannose. Finally, Alkalinema sp. CACIAM 70d presented one CDS, which was identified as a seven\u2010bladed beta\u2010propeller structure with binding sites predicted for sialic acid and N\u2010acetylglucosamine. Despite its singular structure, our analysis suggested this molecule as a new putative antiviral lectin. Overall, the identification and the characterization of new lectins and their homologues are a promising area in antiviral research, and Amazonian cyanobacteria present biotechnological potential to be explored in this regard.","publish_time":"2018-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siqueira, Andrei Santos; Lima, Alex Ranieri Jer\u00F4nimo; Aguiar, Delia Cristina Figueira; Santos, Alberdan Silva; Vianez J\u00FAnior, Jo\u00E3o L\u00EDdio da Silva Gon\u00E7alves; Gon\u00E7alves, Evonnildo Costa","journal":"Proteins","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b62cb8b15ead1c29a8a4a3b39605dd0a5bbe2f33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167734.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30035823/; https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.25577","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CACIAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new antiviral lectins","cyanobacterial lectins","CACIAM","antiviral research","antiviral agents","characterization of new lectins","binding residues","new putative antiviral lectin","cyanobacterial strains","binding sites","N homologues","Amazonian Cyanobacterial diversity","unique CDS","broad biotechnological potential","Amazonian cyanobacteria present biotechnological potential","little research","genomic analysis","propeller structure","singular structure","hypothetical proteins","lectin domains","known cyanovirins","proteins of nonimmune origin","Cole\u00E7\u00E3o Amaz\u00F4nica","host cell receptors","homology modeling","Cianobact\u00E9rias e Microalgas","molecule","sialic acid","molecular dynamics simulations","capable of recognizing","promising area","bladed beta","interaction of viral glycoproteins","Leu","models","Tolypothrix","functional properties","glycoconjugate moieties","favorable interactions","dimannose","Asn","acetylglucosamine","identification","order","free energy calculations","Alkalinema","regard","Nostoc","structures"],"language":"en"},

We develop an agent-based model (ABM), in which each individual is explicitly represented and vector populations are linked to precipitation estimates in a tropical setting. The model is implemented on both scale-free and regular networks. The spatio-temporal transmission of chikungunya is analysed and the presence of asymptomatic silent spreaders within the population is investigated in the context of implementing travel restrictions during an outbreak. Preventing the movement of symptomatic individuals is found to be an insufficient mechanism to halt the spread of the disease, which can be readily carried to neighbouring nodes via sub-clinical individuals.

A detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range [ability to infect humans or human cells in culture] and to predict their detection by the currently used 9CFR procedures. There are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9CFR testing procedures; even within families, not all members would necessarily be detected. Testing gaps and alternative methodologies should be evaluated to continue to ensure safe, high quality human biologicals.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcus-Sekura, Carol; Richardson, James C.; Harston, Rebecca K.; Sane, Nandini; Sheets, Rebecca L.","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a2033ede81066df89e36488781dfd080b01a6e1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/69dfeadcc87be66e03c6d8d77540d5c1834b33c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3206158.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3206158?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105611001126; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105611001126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22000165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Department of Agriculture","USDA"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["porcine viruses","CFR testing of porcine trypsin","CFR testing procedures","porcine cells","testing of bovine serum","CFR tests","CFR procedures","porcine parvovirus","CFR screen","human cells","specific viruses","Testing gaps","porcine raw materials","additional families","virus families","testing cell substrates","viruses of potential risk","production of human biological products","human host range","high quality human biologicals","Recent contaminations","humans","ability","Department of Agriculture","USDA","immunofluorescence","swine","requirements","cattle","issue","cytopathicity","hemadsorption","alternative methodologies","detailed literature search","Assay sensitivity","detection","members"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the radioprotective effects of radiation caused damages in hematopoietic system and normal tissues in mice. A total of 57 BALB/c mice were randomized into six treatment groups: control, IR treatment (0.195, 0.585 and 1.170g/kg, p.o. daily), L-glutamine (0.520g/kg) and sham group. All mice except the sham group were irradiated and then administered for one week. The radioprotective effect on hematopoietic system, serum cytokines, and intestinal toxicity was studied. Protective effects on spleen and thymus are found in IR-treated groups. IR assisted in restoration of leukocytopenia after whole mice irradiation with significant reduction of serum TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6. These enhancements of hematopoietic effects are due to an increase in the serum G-CSF concentration in IR treated groups. In histopathological assessment, significant improvement of intestine toxicity is observed in high-dose IR and L-glutamine group. Evidences show that IR has potentials to be a radioprotector, especially in recovery of hematopoietic system, reduction of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal toxicity.

DLSP built onto previous efforts by malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) programs and supported the expansion of the diagnostic expertise and capacity in KEMRI and the Ministry of Health. First, DLSP developed laboratory capacity for surveillance of diarrheal, respiratory, zoonotic and febrile illnesses to understand the etiology burden of these common illnesses and support evidenced-based decisions on vaccine introductions and recommendations in Kenya. Second, we have evaluated and implemented new diagnostic technologies such as TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) to detect emerging or reemerging pathogens and have recently added a next generation sequencer (NGS). Third, DLSP provided rapid laboratory diagnostic support for outbreak investigation to Kenya and regional countries. Fourth, DLSP has been assisting the Kenya National Public Health laboratory-National Influenza Center and microbiology reference laboratory to obtain World Health Organization (WHO) certification and ISO15189 accreditation respectively. Fifth, we have supported biosafety and biosecurity curriculum development to help Kenyan laboratories safely and appropriately manage infectious pathogens. These achievements, highlight how in collaboration with existing CDC programs working on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the Global Health Security Agenda can have significantly improve public health in Kenya and the region. Moreover, Kenya provides an example as to how laboratory science can help countries detect and control of infectious disease outbreaks and other public health threats more rapidly, thus enhancing global health security.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunsperger, Elizabeth; Juma, Bonventure; Onyango, Clayton; Ochieng, John B.; Omballa, Victor; Fields, Barry S.; Njenga, M.

CASE SERIES: We cared for three adolescent patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to EVALI. All three patients were treated with high-dose steroids in addition to antimicrobials, which resulted in clinical improvement and resolution of their respiratory failure. Pulmonary function testing was performed on these previously healthy patients both acutely and subacutely. Additionally, we report the results from the laboratory analysis of one vaping device fluid which revealed previously unpublished components within these products. DISCUSSION: EVALI is a recent public health concern without a known etiology which can cause life-threatening lung injury in patients without prior lung pathology.

Impairment of the kidney is not typically seen in Coronavirus infections. The role of kidney infection in MERS is not understood. FINDINGS: A systematic review of communicated and peer-reviewed case reports revealed differences in descriptions of kidney involvement in MERS versus SARS patients. In particular, ARF in MERS patients occurred considerably earlier after a median time to onset of 11 days (SD \u00B12,0 days) as opposed to 20 days for SARS, according to the literature. In-situ histological staining of the respective cellular receptors for MERS- and SARS-Coronavirus showed highly similar staining patterns with a focus of a receptor-specific signal in kidney epithelial cells. Comparative infection experiments with SARS- and MERS-CoV in primary human kidney cells versus primary human bronchial epithelial cells showed cytopathogenic infection only in kidney cells, and only if infected with MERS-CoV. Kidney epithelial cells produced almost 1000-fold more infectious MERS-CoV progeny than bronchial epithelial cells, while only a small difference was seen between cell types when infected with SARS-CoV. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological studies should analyze kidney impairment and its characteristics in MERS-CoV. Virus replication in the kidney with potential shedding in urine might constitute a way of transmission, and could explain untraceable transmission chains leading to new cases. Individual patients might benefit from early induction of renoprotective treatment.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eckerle, Isabella; M\u00FCller, Marcel A; Kallies, Stephan; Gotthardt, Daniel N; Drosten, Christian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97c615d915000b15e55f71d20e045bf939c6bca5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24364985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","kidney epithelial cells","MERS patients","kidney impairment","SARS-Coronavirus","primary human kidney cells","infectious MERS-CoV progeny","SARS patients","role of kidney infection","descriptions of kidney involvement","primary human bronchial epithelial cells","days","Coronavirus infections","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","cytopathogenic infection","ARF","Individual patients","similar staining patterns","Comparative infection experiments","published case reports","symptoms similar","peer-reviewed case reports","way of transmission","situ histological staining","untraceable transmission chains","additional component of acute renal failure","differences","respective cellular receptors","focus","receptor-specific signal","fold","potential shedding","urine","small difference","cell types","early induction of renoprotective treatment","new cases","onset","BACKGROUND","Epidemiological studies","characteristics","systematic review","median time","Virus replication","CONCLUSION","SD","FINDINGS","literature"],"language":"en"},

We took advantage of the natural persistence of Myl-CoV in bats that were experimentally inoculated with P. destructans in a previous study. Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence. Levels of coronavirus antibodies were also higher in fungal-infected bats.

Whilst an effective live-attenuated vaccine is available for livestock, there is currently no licensed human RVF vaccine. Replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) vectors are an ideal platform for development of a human RVF vaccine, given the low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against them in the human population, and their excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in human clinical trials of vaccines against a wide range of pathogens. METHODS: Here, in BALB/c mice, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAdOx1, encoding the RVF virus envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which are targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. The ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine was assessed in comparison to a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector encoding Gn and Gc (HAdV5-GnGc), a strategy previously shown to confer protective immunity against RVF in mice. RESULTS: A single immunization with either of the vaccines conferred protection against RVF virus challenge eight weeks post-immunization. Both vaccines elicited RVF virus neutralizing antibody and a robust CD8(\u002B) T cell response. CONCLUSIONS: Together the results support further development of RVF vaccines based on replication-deficient adenovirus vectors, with ChAdOx1-GnGc being a potential candidate for use in future human clinical trials.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warimwe, George M; Lorenzo, Gema; Lopez-Gil, Elena; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Cottingham, Matthew G; Spencer, Alexandra J; Collins, Katharine A; Dicks, Matthew DJ; Milicic, Anita; Lall, Amar; Furze, Julie; Turner, Alison V; Hill, Adrian VS; Brun, Alejandro; Gilbert, Sarah C","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f04ae49e396269b6fc64538613ea9a6d53583bd6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ffd791c34aa1431d8571663c1fa722086d0ad90f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4235025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24304565/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-349","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley Fever","RVF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["licensed human RVF vaccine","development of RVF vaccines","RVF virus challenge","human health","replication-deficient human adenovirus type","human population","human clinical trials of vaccines","replication-deficient adenovirus vectors","RVF virus envelope glycoproteins","ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine","replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector","future human clinical trials","HAdV5-GnGc","RESULTS","effective live-attenuated vaccine","low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies","livestock production","immunogenicity profile","single immunization","c mice","weeks post-immunization","use","potential candidate","excellent safety","robust CD8","sub-Saharan Africa","ideal platform","antibody","protection","comparison","viral zoonosis","Rift Valley Fever","epizootics","strategy","BACKGROUND","wide range of pathogens","protective immunity","efficacy","T cell response","BALB","Arabian Peninsula","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We report here that lactose and anti-galectin-3 antibodies completely abrogate homotypic aggregation induced by anti-CD13 antibodies. Furthermore, galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitates with CD13 from resting U-937 cells and this association decreases during the aggregation process, a phenomenon that may have functional implications.

Rapid identification of viral etiology is critical in ruling out non\u2010viral infections, initiating antiviral treatment and limiting the spread of the infection. Multiplex assays of more than one viral gene target in a single tube have the advantage of rapid screening of a large number of potential viral pathogens in a short time. A multiplex real\u2010time PCR assay was used in this study for detection of respiratory RNA and DNA viral infections in 728 specimens received from 585 adult and pediatric patients comprised of symptomatic and asymptomatic organ transplant recipients and non\u2010recipients for diagnosis of respiratory illnesses and for routine clinical monitoring. Multiplex PCR was more sensitive than the multiplex immunofluoresence culture assay (R\u2010mix) and also detected additional respiratory viruses that were not covered by the R\u2010mix panel. The number of respiratory viruses detected in symptomatic patients was significantly higher than asymptomatic patients in both adult and pediatric patients. Herpesviral infections were the predominant cause of lower respiratory tract infection in the organ transplant recipients, whereas respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen in non\u2010transplant patients particularly children. Multiplex real\u2010time PCR for detection of respiratory viruses has the potential for rapid identification of viral pathogens. In this era of emerging viral infections, addition of newer viral targets to the multiplex PCR panels will be beneficial in determining both patient management and public health epidemiology. J. Med.

OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this report were to describe the clinical findings of an outbreak of EV\u2010D68 infection in Mexico City and identify the genetic relationship with previously reported strains. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between September and December 2014, 126 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of hospitalized children \u003C15 years of age with ARI were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT\u2010qPCR and EV\u2010D68\u2010specific RT\u2010qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using VP1 region. RESULTS: Enterovirus/rhinovirus infection was detected in 40 patients (31\u00B77%), of which 24 patients were EV\u2010D68\u2010positive. EV\u2010D68 infection prevailed over September and October 2014 and was associated with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and patients were more likely to develop hypoxemia.

The populations of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who have demonstrated better response to non-invasive ventilation are those with previous cardiac or respiratory disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By contrast, the use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia without these pre-existing diseases should be very cautious and under strict monitoring conditions, since there are increasing evidences that the unnecessary delay in intubation of those patients who fail treatment with non-invasive ventilation is associated with lower survival. Pulmonary complications of immunosuppressed patients are associated with high rates of intubation and mortality. The use of non-invasive ventilation in these patients may decrease the need for intubation and improve the poor outcome associated with these complications. Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in several conditions characterised by alveolar collapse. While this is extremely useful in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the efficacy in pneumonia seems limited to immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary complications. Conversely, there are no sufficient evidences on the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory failure.","publish_time":"2012-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrer, Miquel; Cosentini, Roberto; Nava, Stefano","journal":"European Journal of Internal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e6d93df243a22c0e498be1c77deddf0a610fe06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126754.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2012.02.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620512000647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726370/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620512000647","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunocompetent patients","pneumonia","populations of patients","Pulmonary complications of immunosuppressed patients","use of non-invasive ventilation","respiratory disease","causes of severe acute respiratory failure","community","acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema","high rates of treatment failure","high rates of intubation","efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","sufficient evidences","strict monitoring conditions","unnecessary delay","better response","pre-existing diseases","poor outcome","mortality","need","lower survival","contrast","alveolar collapse"],"language":"en"},

There is evidence suggesting that CD147, an adhesion molecule associated with survival of cells in tumor metastasis and cell-cell contacts, plays an important role in resistance to anoikis. However, information regarding the functions of CD147 in mediating cell-cell contacts and anoikis-resistance remains limited and even self-contradictory. RESULTS: An anoikis-resistant clone (HEK293ar), derived from anoikis-sensitive parental Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, survived anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts. The expression of HAb18G/CD147 (a member of the CD147 family) was upregulated and the protein was located at cell-cell junctions. Upregulation of HAb18G/CD147 in suspended HEK293ar cells suppressed anoikis by mediating the formation of cell-cell adhesions. Anoikis resistance in HEK293ar cells also required E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Knock-down of HAb18G/CD147 and E-cadherin inhibited cell-cell contacts formation and increased anoikis sensitivity respectively. When HAb18G/CD147 was downregulated, E-cadherin expression in HEK293ar cells was significantly suppressed; however, knockdown of E-cadherin by E-cadherin siRNA or blocking of E-cadherin binding activity with a specific antibody and EDTA had no significant effect on HAb18G/CD147 expression. Finally, pretreatment with LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) inhibitor, disrupted cell-cell contacts and decreased cell number, but this was not the case in cells treated with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new evidence that HAb18G/CD147-mediated cell-cell contact confers anoikis resistance in an E-cadherin-dependent manner; and cell-cell contact mediated resistance to anoikis implicates PI3K pathway in a highly relevant cell model (HEK293ar). Understanding of the role of HAb18G/CD147 cell-cell contacts in anoikis resistance may help in understanding the survival of cells in anchorage-independent growth, such as cells in tumor metastasis and suspension culture produced for biomedical engineering. Our results also contribute to a better understanding of the biology of HEK293 cell spheroids, a major workhorse for producing human therapeutic agents and viral vaccines.","publish_time":"2010-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Xiao-Kui; Wang, Li; Li, Yu; Yang, Xiang-Ming; Zhao, Pu; HaoTang; Zhu, Ping; Li, Ling; Chen, Zhi-Nan","journal":"BMC Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58a9c23ad5702fdc007f682342e3a77fe5516a8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2864199.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2121-11-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Embryonic Kidney","EDTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell junctions","CD147 cell-cell contacts","mediated cell-cell contacts","mediating cell-cell contacts","disrupted cell-cell contacts","formation of cell","cell adhesions","CD147-mediated cell-cell contact","E-cadherin inhibited cell-cell contacts formation","anoikis-resistance","Anoikis resistance","decreased cell number","relevant cell model","biology of HEK293 cell spheroids","survival of cells","survived anoikis","CD147 expression","E-cadherin expression","suspended HEK293ar cells","functions of CD147","CD147 family","E-cadherin siRNA","mediated resistance","expression of HAb18G","increased anoikis sensitivity","anoikis-resistant clone","role of HAb18G","production of suspension culture cells","E-cadherin binding activity","knockdown of E","Acquisition of resistance","Upregulation of HAb18G","anoikis-sensitive parental Human Embryonic Kidney","RESULTS","tumor metastasis","tumor progression","biomedical engineering","better understanding","PI3K pathway","inhibitor PD98059","new evidence","important role","human therapeutic agents","anchorage-independent growth","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","independent matrix-deficient conditions","major workhorse","specific antibody","significant effect","ERK","EDTA","AKT","dependent manner","adhesion molecule","viral vaccines","phosphoinositide","member","LY294002","CONCLUSIONS","protein","pretreatment","BACKGROUND","information","case"],"language":"en"},

How clinical presentation, pathological features and therapies influence outcome was evaluated in 37 thoroughly characterized patients with celiac disease and T-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical files were studied retrospectively. Lymphoma and intestinal mucosa were analysed by histopathology, multiplex PCR and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotyping. Survival and prognostic factors were analysed using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves with Logrank test and Cox Model. RESULTS: Lymphoma complicated non clonal enteropathy, celiac disease (n = 15) and type I refractory celiac disease (n = 2) in 17 patients and clonal type II refractory celiac disease in 20 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery with resection of the main tumour mass in 22 cases. In univariate analysis, non clonal celiac disease, serum albumin level \u003E 21.6 g/L at diagnosis, chemotherapy and surgical resection predicted good survival (p = 0.0007, p \u003C 0.0001, p \u003C 0.0001, p \u003C 0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, serum albumin level \u003E 21.6 g/L, chemotherapy and reductive surgery were all significantly associated with increased survival (p \u003C 0.002, p \u003C 0.03, p \u003C 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines the prognostic value of celiac disease type in patients with T-cell lymphoma, and suggests that a combination of nutritional, chemotherapy and reductive surgery may improve survival.","publish_time":"2013-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malamut, Georgia; Chandesris, Olivia; Verkarre, Virginie; Meresse, Bertrand; Callens, C\u00E9line; Macintyre, Elizabeth; Bouhnik, Yoram; Gornet, Jean-Marc; Allez, Matthieu; Jian, Raymond; Berger, Anne; Ch\u00E2tellier, Gilles; Brousse, Nicole; Hermine, Olivier; Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine; Cellier, Christophe","journal":"Dig Liver Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d943213b7067c93e38073661b3237be2e370261.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313469/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1590865812004380; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2012.12.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865812004380","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","clonal celiac disease","refractory celiac disease","T-cell lymphoma","prognostic value of celiac disease type","associated T cell lymphoma","clonal type","chemotherapy","predictors of survival","good survival","increased survival","clonal enteropathy","reductive surgery","serum albumin level","surgical resection","Prognosis of enteropathy","intestinal mucosa","prognostic factors","multivariate analysis","univariate analysis","intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotyping","multiplex PCR","Logrank test","Meier curves","Kaplan","histopathology","pathological features","therapies","main tumour mass","Cox Model","clinical presentation","study","diagnosis","combination of nutritional","outcome","cases","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","Medical files","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Results: SARS-CoV minus-RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus-RNA were detectable for a longer period (8\u201312 days post-onset).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to Feb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1\u201325%), 2 (26\u201350%), 3 (51\u201375%), or 4 (76\u2013100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p \u003C 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962\u20130.985).

METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on human nasal epithelial cells following stimulation of the intracellular viral recognition receptor RIG-I. Next, we evaluated whether measuring identified host mRNAs and proteins from patient nasopharyngeal swabs could predict the presence of a respiratory virus in the sample. RESULTS: Our first study showed that a signature of 3 mRNAs, CXCL10, IFIT2, and OASL, predicted respiratory virus detection with an accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9\u20131.0), and identified proteins correlating with virus detection. In a second study, elevated CXCL11 or CXCL10 protein levels identified samples containing respiratory viruses, including viruses not on the initial test panel. Overall area under the curve (AUC) values were: CXCL11 AUC = 0.901 (95% CI, 0.86\u20130.94); CXCL10 AUC = 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80\u20130.91).

Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) is an ISG product that suppresses early stage infection by a number of viruses through an as yet unknown mechanism of action. Moreover, the actions of IFITM1 on HCV infection are not fully elucidated. Here we identify IFITM1 as a hepatocyte tight junction protein and a potent anti-HCV effector molecule. IFITM1 expression is induced early during IFN treatment of hepatocytes and accumulates at hepatic tight junctions in HCV-infected human patient liver during IFN therapy. Additionally, we found that IFITM1 interacts with HCV co-receptors including CD81 and occludin to disrupt the process of viral entry. Thus, IFITM1 is an anti-HCV ISG whose actions impart control of HCV infection through interruption of viral coreceptor function. CONCLUSION: This study defines IFITM1 as an ISG effector with action against HCV entry. Design of therapy regimens to enhance IFITM1 expression should improve the virologic response among HCV patients undergoing treatment with type I IFN.","publish_time":"2012-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkins, Courtney; Woodward, Jessica; Lau, Daryl T-Y; Barnes, Amy; Joyce, Michael; McFarlane, Nicola; McKeating, Jane; Tyrrell, D.

The infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection. Animals experienced weight loss, fever, high virus titers in tissue, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, high liver transaminases and phosphatases and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Evidence of a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis was seen in EBOV animals. MARV-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen. Lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in spleen. These findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever.","publish_time":"2011-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrion, Ricardo; Ro, Youngtae; Hoosien, Kareema; Ticer, Anysha; Brasky, Kathy; de la Garza, Melissa; Mansfield, Keith; Patterson, Jean L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc9d6076a668578fb0e4e0b548a8036664631379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3195836.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211003965; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21959017/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211003965","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marburgvirus Musoke"],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filovirus disease","fatal hemorrhagic disease","small nonhuman primate model","systemic fatal disease","nonhuman primates","filovirus family","hemorrhagic fever","EBOV animals","human infection","spleen","severe disseminated viral infection","MARV-infected animals","common marmosets","Animals experienced weight loss","Ebolavirus Zaire","hepatic necrosis","Lymphoid necrosis","Abstract Ebolavirus","high virus titers","high liver transaminases","wild type Marburgvirus Musoke","thrombocytopenia","neutrophilia","tissue","morphological features","phosphatases","moderate fibrin deposition","Callithrix jacchus","members","humans","use","lymphocytic depletion","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

The BDV glycoprotein (G) is an extensively glycosylated protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 84,000 to 94,000 kilodaltons (kDa). BDV G is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular subtilisin-like protease furin into two subunits, a 41 kDa amino terminal protein GP1 and a 43 kDa carboxyl terminal protein GP2. RESULTS: Class III viral fusion proteins (VFP) encoded by members of the Rhabdoviridae, Herpesviridae and Baculoviridae have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta sheets, other beta sheet domains, an extended alpha helical domain, a membrane proximal stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. Proteomics computational analyses suggest that the structural/functional motifs that characterize class III VFP are located collinearly in BDV G. Structural models were established for BDV G based on the post-fusion structure of a prototypic class III VFP, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G).

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p \u003C 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.

The lectins, concanavalin A (Con A), lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), inhibited cell fusion and hemadsorption induced by hPIV-2. Virus nucleoprotein (NP) gene synthesis was largely inhibited, but fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene syntheses were not. An indirect immunofluorescence study showed that Con A inhibited virus NP, F and HN protein syntheses, but LCA did not completely inhibit them, and that PNA inhibited only NP protein synthesis. Using a recombinant green fluorescence protein-expressing hPIV-2, without matrix protein (rghPIV-2\u0394M), it was found that virus entry into the cells was not completely prevented. The lectins considerably reduced the number of viruses released compared with that of virus infected cells. The lectins bound to cell surface within 10 min, and many aggregates were observed at 30 min. Con A and LCA slightly disrupted actin microfilaments and microtubules, but PNA had almost no effect on them.

Viral and bacterial antigens for recombinant subunit vaccines have been produced in a variety of organisms. Transgenic plants are now recognized as legitimate sources for these proteins, especially in the developing area of oral vaccines, because antigens have been shown to be correctly processed in plants into forms that elicit immune responses when fed to animals or humans. Antigens expressed in maize (Zea mays) are particularly attractive since they can be deposited in the natural storage vessel, the corn seed, and can be conveniently delivered to any organism that consumes grain. We have previously demonstrated high level expression of the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and the spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis in corn, and have demonstrated that these antigens delivered in the seed elicit protective immune responses. Here we provide additional data to support the potency, efficacy, and stability of recombinant subunit vaccines delivered in maize seed.","publish_time":"2002-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamphear, Barry J; Streatfield, Stephen J; Jilka, Joseph M; Brooks, Christopher A; Barker, Donna K; Turner, Debra D; Delaney, Donna E; Garcia, Martin; Wiggins, Barry; Woodard, Susan L; Hood, Elizabeth E; Tizard, Ian R; Lawhorn, Bruce; Howard, John A","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edf6ca59e90c583d527dd4e44499a4cfc5867412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127645.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365902002821; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365902002821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antigens"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial antigens","way antigens","stability of recombinant subunit vaccines","corn seed","maize seed","B-subunit","humans","animals","protective immune responses","use of recombinant gene technologies","developing area of oral vaccines","viral pathogens","Transgenic plants","Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin","spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis","vaccine industry","efficacy","potency","proteins","effective means","natural storage vessel","Zea mays","high level expression","legitimate sources","forms","additional data","variety of organisms","grain"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Pneumocystis jirovecii and common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens on sputum samples (spontaneous or induced) from a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected inpatients with World Health Organization danger signs and cough. Mycobacterial culture was done on 2 sputum samples, blood cultures, and relevant extrapulmonary samples. RESULTS: We enrolled 284 participants from 2 secondary-level hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa: median CD4 count was 97 cells/\u03BCL, 64% were women, and 38% were on antiretroviral therapy. One hundred forty-eight had culture-positive tuberculosis, 100 had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 26 had P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and 64 had other diagnoses. Probable bacterial infection (\u003E10(5) copies/mL) was detected in 133 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with CAP (52%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the commonest bacterial pathogens detected; atypical bacteria were uncommon. Viruses were detected in 203 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with PJP (85%). Human metapneumovirus was the commonest virus detected. Multiple coinfections were commonly detected. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum multiplex PCR could become a useful diagnostic tool for bacterial respiratory infections in HIV-infected inpatients, but its value is limited as quantitative cutoffs have only been established for a few bacterial pathogens and validation has not been done in this patient population. We found a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, but it is unclear whether these viruses were causing infection as there are no accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs for diagnosing respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maartens, Gary; Griesel, Rulan; Dube, Felix; Nicol, Mark; Mendelson, Marc","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55f63cd1a7d379f8dad85084a8f05a9bbac102ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108142.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CAP","PJP"],"locations":["Cape Town","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["bacterial respiratory infections","respiratory viral infections","viral respiratory pathogens","commonest bacterial pathogens","etiology of respiratory infections","sputum samples","high prevalence of respiratory viruses","participants","HIV-infected inpatients","Sputum multiplex PCR","Probable bacterial infection","quantitative cutoffs","accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs","infected patients","commonest virus","jirovecii pneumonia","limited data","PJP","human immunodeficiency virus","relevant extrapulmonary samples","resource-limited settings","quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction","prospective cohort study of HIV","Pneumocystis jirovecii","Human metapneumovirus","Mycobacterial culture","culture-positive tuberculosis","Cape Town","South Africa","World Health Organization danger signs","useful diagnostic tool","median CD4 count","secondary-level hospitals","blood cultures","Streptococcus pneumoniae","cough","atypical bacteria","\u03BCL","cells","community","value","Haemophilus influenzae","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","validation","antiretroviral therapy","Multiple coinfections","patient population","women","RESULTS","diagnoses","copies"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 \u2013 December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature ((\u03BF)C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. RESULTS: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04\u20131.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10\u20131.65) were associated with increased cases 8\u201310 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01\u20131.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5\u20136 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, Emma G.; Kelton, David; Poljak, Zvonimir; Van Kerkhove, Maria; von Dobschuetz, Sophie; Greer, Amy L.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e69eb0c40279678624a4085b3544199d0f5b712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6362578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3729-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["primary cases of MERS","primary MERS cases","primary MERS human cases","primary human cases","increased cases","increased number of cases","risk of primary MERS infections","available line list of human MERS cases","development of primary MERS-CoV infections","wind speed","days","High visibility","low visibility","preceding weather conditions","patterns of zoonotic transmission","different weather conditions","Saudi Arabia","spillover transmission","maximum temperature","RESULTS","Lowest temperature","Weather variables","relative humidity","significant associations","respiratory diseases","dromedary camels","meteorological stations","meteorological factors","seasonal patterns","absence of epidemiological data","case-crossover design","complete case dataset","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reservoir species","Arabian Peninsula","week incubation period","univariable conditional logistic regression","tertiles","environmental component","key initial evidence","BACKGROUND","people","strata","Odds Ratio","daily mean","largest city","minimum","behavioural changes","World Health Organization","humans","sporadic event","province","analysis","temperate climates","METHODS","halves","CONCLUSIONS","opposite relationship","study","symptom onset","Confidence Interval"],"language":"en"},

This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. KEY MESSAGES: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciotti, Marco; Angeletti, Silvia; Minieri, Marilena; Giovannetti, Marta; Benvenuto, Domenico; Pascarella, Stefano; Sagnelli, Caterina; Bianchi, Martina; Bernardini, Sergio; Ciccozzi, Massimo","journal":"Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d9f458494cc2e63461249f75c8575cecb202e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179549.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32259829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Coronavirus Study Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","novel coronavirus","homology modeling","Coronavirus Study Group","molecular diagnostics of SARS","case identification","KEY MESSAGES","health systems","Wuhan-Hu","Chinese health authorities","unknown origin","International Committee","outbreak of pneumonia","phylogenesis","viral evolution","tracing","specific diagnostic assays","animal source","Phylogenetic analysis","Betacoronavirus genus","Coronaviridae family","enormous impact","epidemiology","vaccine strategies","subgenus Sarbecovirus","current knowledge","Hubei Province","implementation of control measures","Taxonomy of Viruses","GenBank accession","MN908947","thousands of deaths","therapies","economies","genome","nCoV","days","scientific community","review","discovery","SUMMARY","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

A previous report (Virology 2003, 311:16\u201327) indicated that transfected IBV 3b localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells using a vaccinia-virus expression system. Although we confirmed these findings, we observed cytoplasmic localization of IBV 3b with apparent exclusion from the nucleus in avian cells (IBV normally infects chickens). IBV 3b was virtually undetectable by microscopy in mammalian cells transfected without vaccinia virus and in IBV-infected mammalian cells because of a greatly reduced half-life in these cells. A proteasome inhibitor stabilized IBV 3b in mammalian cells, but had little effect on IBV 3b in avian cells, suggesting that rapid turnover of IBV 3b in mammalian cells is proteasome-dependent while turnover in avian cells may be proteasome-independent.

Recent studies suggest that MHV infection alters gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated intercellular communication in brain and primary cultured astrocytes. In addition to astrocytes, meningeal fibroblasts also express high levels of Cx43. Fibroblasts in the meninges together with the basal lamina and the astrocyte endfeet forms the glial limitans superficialis as part of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Alteration of glial-pial gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in MHV infection has the potential to affect the integrity of BBB. Till date, it is not known if viral infection can modulate Cx43 expression and function in cells of the brain meninges and thus affect BBB permeability. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of MHV infection on Cx43 localization and function in mouse brain meningeal cells and primary meningeal fibroblasts. Our results show that MHV infection reduces total Cx43 levels and causes its intracellular retention in the perinuclear compartments reducing its surface expression. Reduced trafficking of Cx43 to the cell surface in MHV-infected cells is associated with loss functional GJIC. Together, these data suggest that MHV infection can directly affect expression and cellular distribution of Cx43 resulting in loss of Cx43-mediated GJIC in meningeal fibroblasts, which may be associated with altered BBB function observed in acute infection.","publish_time":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bose, Abhishek; Basu, Rahul; Maulik, Mahua; Das Sarma, Jayasri","journal":"Mol Neurobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5a734c9891784441fe1c1ca78ddd5a8dd32c5be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327203/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-017-0861-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","BBB","GJIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cx43 expression","effect of MHV infection","loss of Cx43","Cx43 localization","acute infection","viral infection","MHV-infected cells","total Cx43 levels","high levels of Cx43","cellular distribution of Cx43","Reduced trafficking of Cx43","primary meningeal fibroblasts","mouse brain meningeal cells","brain meninges","altered BBB function","brain barrier","neuro-glial","Alteration of glial","surface expression","mediated GJIC","BBB permeability","integrity of BBB","glial-pial homeostasis","pial gap junction intercellular communication","glial limitans superficialis","loss functional GJIC","primary cultured astrocytes","gap junction protein connexin","cell surface","Mouse hepatitis virus","astrocyte endfeet","intracellular retention","perinuclear compartments","blood","meningoencephalitis","basal lamina","potential","Recent studies","addition","results","data","present study","date"],"language":"en"},

Diabetes is an established risk associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with COVID-19 has not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality due to COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.

It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved. The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, Chem. Rev.2019, 119, 947831244000; Wang, Curr. Comput.-Aided Drug Des.2006, 2, 287; Wang; HouJ. Chem. Inf. Model., 2012, 52, 119922497310). Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, \u221213.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (\u22123.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (\u22127.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of \u221212.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor\u2013ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor\u2013ligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Junmei","journal":"J Chem Inf Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/382b9660dcd287ab027029d1902a41266c530e38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197972.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wang"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","drug candidates","MERS-CoV","kcal","predicted binding free energy","ligand binding","approved anticancer drug","rational drug design","promising drug repurposing candidates","free energy calculations","main protease","Wang","second-best repurposing drug candidate","potential inhibitors of SARS","crystal structure of SARS","computer-aided drug design techniques","eravacycline","charged form","promising known drugs","PBSA-WSAS","Detailed receptor","carfilzomib","COVID","virtual docking screening of approved drugs","Boltzmann surface area","hot spot residue","molecular mechanics","ligand interactions","hot spots","charged molecule","bonded inhibitor","proteasome inhibitor","conserved residue","neutral form","docking hits","weighted solvent-accessible surface area","molecular dynamics simulations","hepatitis C virus","synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic","Poisson","end point method","recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","His41","D structures of key viral proteins","complex","viruses","clinical trials","text","Liu","inhibitory effect","valrubicin","lopinavir","study","possible treatment strategies","N3","HCV","market","PubChem","pdb6LU7","elbasvir","Image","advantage","findings","Streptomycin","Curr","HouJ","Model"],"language":"en"},

The acquisition of passive immunity in the calf by vaccinating the dam has shown some success in previous studies; however, no data exists on the use of currently licensed vaccines in the United States. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether vaccinating cows in late gestation with a commercially available Salmonella Dublin vaccine would stimulate Salmonella-specific antibodies in the colostrum of cows at calving and whether these antibodies would be transferred to the calf. Thirty Holstein cows were vaccinated 3wk before the end of lactation with a Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin vaccine, with a second dose given at dry-off. An additional 30 cows received only saline. Calves had a blood sample collected immediately after birth and were then fed fresh colostrum from their dam within 2 h of calving. A postcolostrum blood sample was collected 24 to 48 h later. Salmonella Dublin antibodies in colostrum as well as serum from the cows and calves were measured using an ELISA technique. Results of this study showed that vaccinated cattle had elevated Salmonella Dublin antibody titers at the time of calving (40.3\u00B19.1) as compared with control cows (\u22129.4\u00B11.1). Calves that received colostrum from vaccinated cattle also had a significant increase in Salmonella Dublin antibodies (88.5\u00B18.9) as compared with calves born to unvaccinated cows (\u22123.2\u00B11.2). This study demonstrated that the use of a commercially available Salmonella Dublin vaccine can stimulate antibodies that are passed on to the calf via colostral transfer.

Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1\u20133 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method. Results: Of 50 NPA specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness, 11 (22%) were positive in our first generation RT-PCR assay. With a modification in the RNA extraction protocol, 22 (44%) samples were positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. By combining the modified RNA extraction method and real-time quantitative PCR technology, 40 (80%) of these samples were positive in the real-time RT-PCR assay. No positive signal was observed in the negative controls. Conclusion: By optimizing RNA extraction methods and applying quantitative real time RT-PCR technologies, the sensitivity of tests for early diagnosis of SARS can be greatly enhanced.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poon, Leo L.M.; Chan, Kwok Hung; Wong, On Kei; Yam, Wing Cheong; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Guan, Yi; Lo, Y.M.Dennis; Peiris, Joseph S.M.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a253b00f6d2665d359175bb1476caacd351c24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129783.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653203002476; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653203002476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","NPA","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time RT-PCR assay","generation RT-PCR assay","real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay","generation conventional RT-PCR assay","real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology","modified RNA extraction method","RNA extraction protocol","real-time quantitative PCR technology","routine RNA extraction method","SARS-Cov","viral RNA extraction methods","quantitative real time RT-PCR technologies","detection of SARS","SARS patients","SARS CoV infections","early diagnosis of SARS","negative control samples","positive signal","days of illness","sensitivity of tests","low sensitivity","novel coronavirus","early stage","NPA specimens","negative controls","aetiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","nasopharyngeal aspirate","disease onset","Lancet","Study design","Molecular assays","sensitive diagnostic test","Abstract Background","modification","Conclusion","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

During April 2011\u2013April 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey on home environment and childhood health and collected 13,335 parents-reported questionnaires of 4\u20136 year-old children in Shanghai, China. In this paper, we investigated associations between the incidence and duration of common colds among these children during the past 12 months before the survey and frequency of opening windows, as well as household dampness-related exposures (indicated by six dampness indicators). Significantly higher incidence (\u22653 times) and longer duration (\u22652 weeks) of common cold were found among children with than without these dampness exposures (p-value \u003C0.01 for mold spots and p-value \u003C0.001 for all other indicators). The number of dampness-related indicators had a positive and strong dose-response relationship with common colds (p-trend \u003C0.01). Low frequency of ventilation was also a risk factor for children common colds. After adjusted for the potential confounders in the multiple logistic regression analyses, all dampness-related indicators were significantly associated with the increased odds of common colds and the highest odds ratios was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.16\u20131.27). We also found that dampness-related exposures and household ventilation habits (p-value for interaction \u003C0.001) had a strong interaction effect on the incidence and duration of common cold. The stratified analysis of ventilation condition displays that the influence of dampness-related exposures has been modified by ventilation. Therefore, good household ventilation habits may have an effect of modification for dampness-related exposures.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Chanjuan; Huang, Chen; Liu, Wei; Zou, Zhijun; Hu, Yu; Shen, Li","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37dff9bf90e6fae79d4ccb422ada59ec1c11624c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115772.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132317303323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317303323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["dampness exposures","dampness-related indicators","household dampness-related exposures","dampness indicators","children common colds","effects of dampness","duration of common colds","influence of dampness","number of dampness","common colds of preschool children","increased odds of common colds","poor household ventilation","p-value","good household ventilation habits","Low frequency of ventilation","year-old children","interaction effects","p-trend","strong interaction effect","stratified analysis of ventilation condition","longer duration","higher incidence","cross-sectional survey","effect of modification","highest odds ratios","frequency of opening windows","strong dose-response relationship","multiple logistic regression analyses","childhood health","risk factor","home environment","potential confounders","mold spots","times","months","weeks","parents","questionnaires","Shanghai","China","associations","studies","paper"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of lift-up buildings with different aspect ratios (height/width) on the surrounding PLW field and pedestrian wind comfort level. Five lift-up buildings with aspect ratios 4:1 to 0.5:1 were tested in a boundary layer wind tunnel and results were compared with those of five buildings with similar dimensions but without lift-up design. The results reveal a strong dependence of the maximum wind speed in lift-up areas with building height, which results subsequently a small area of acceptable wind conditions near tall and slender lift-up buildings. Lift-up designs adopted for short and wide buildings produce larger areas of pedestrian wind comfort.

This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 \u03BCm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of \u003C300 nm and \u003E300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton\u2013silk, cotton\u2013chiffon, cotton\u2013flannel) was \u003E80% (for particles \u003C300 nm) and \u003E90% (for particles \u003E300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of \u201Cfit\u201D and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konda, Abhiteja; Prakash, Abhinav; Moss, Gregory A.; Schmoldt, Michael; Grant, Gregory D.; Guha, Supratik","journal":"ACS Nano","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5e7a5a87209f8768284707adb2e2d73b2cd8c2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185834.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329337/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filtration efficiencies","cotton","nm","various fabrics","available fabrics","use of cloth masks","filtration efficiency","performance of various","common fabrics","combinations of various","face masks","electrostatic-based filtration","various synthetics","future cloth mask design studies","transmission of aerosol particles","silk","chiffon","significant protection","significant demand","need","significant difference","specific combination of different fabrics","hybrids","flannel","limited knowledge available","respiratory virus transmission","function of aerosol particulate sizes","enhanced performance","respiratory system","improper fit","particle sizes","higher weave densities","combined effect of mechanical","account issues","large sections","thread count","leakage","emergence","pandemic","single layer","current global spread of COVID","text","\u03BCm range","public","material","exhaled air","Image","gaps","multiple layers"],"language":"en"},

The aetiology of RL in cats is unknown, but inflammation is often seen in conjunction with RL. Vitamin D involvement has been suggested because 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) stimulates osteoclastogenesis, through up-regulation of the nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR). The aim of this study is to determine the involvement of inflammatory cytokines and the possible role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of RL using quantitative PCR. We measured the mRNA expression of cytokines with stimulatory (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03B1) and inhibitory effects (IL-10 and IFN-\u03B3) on osteoclastogenesis, and the mRNA expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and nVDR in RL samples. We found increased expression of mRNA levels for inflammatory cytokines and nVDR, but not for RANKL and OPG, in tissue from RL-affected cats compared with tissue from radiological confirmed healthy controls. The mRNA levels of nVDR were positively correlated with mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and IFN-\u03B3), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), pro-resorptive (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03B1), and anti-resorptive (IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10) cytokines in the course of resorptive lesions. These data are consistent with our view that both inflammation and an overexpression of the nVDR are likely to be involved in RL in cats.","publish_time":"2009-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Booij-Vrieling, Henri\u00EBtte E.; Tryfonidou, Marianna A.; Riemers, Frank M.; Penning, Louis C.; Hazewinkel, Herman A.W.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd920a865895abd37e05a25dfe3fca10608e6c29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127172.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242709001780; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19556012/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242709001780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL","mRNA levels of nVDR","mRNA expression of cytokines","pathophysiology of RL","cats","aetiology of RL","RL samples","Vitamin D involvement","mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory","involvement of inflammatory cytokines","nuclear vitamin D receptor","increased expression of mRNA levels","pro-resorptive","IFN-\u03B3","TNF-\u03B1","dihydroxyvitamin D","anti-resorptive","possible role of vitamin D","course of resorptive lesions","tissue","RANKL","Abstract Dental resorptive lesions","inflammation","osteoclastogenesis","OPG","receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand","Felis catus","common oral disease","osteoprotegerin","regulation","radiological confirmed healthy controls","inhibitory effects","pain","view","overexpression","OH","quantitative PCR","anti-inflammatory","tooth destruction","data","study","conjunction","aim"],"language":"en"},

High levels of neutralizing antibodies, mostly directed against the viral fusion (F) glycoprotein, correlate with protection against either hRSV or hMPV. However, no cross\u2010neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified F proteins. Based on crystal structures of hRSV F and hMPV F, we designed chimeric F proteins in which certain residues of well\u2010characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens. The antigenic changes were monitored by ELISA with virus\u2010specific monoclonal antibodies. Inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross\u2010neutralizing antibody responses, and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site.

Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.","publish_time":"1988-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Correa, Isabel; Jim\u00E9nez, Gustavo; Su\u00F1\u00E9, Carlos; Bullido, Mar\u00EDa J.; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900597; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900597","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigenic sites","native virus","antigenic subsites","virus E2 glycoprotein","neutralizing MAbs specific","TGE virus site C","virus neutralization","murine MAbs","E2-glycoprotein","antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis","hybridomas specific","porcine immunoglobulins","conformational epitopes","non-immune porcine sera","mixtures of native","non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum","hybridomas mice immunizations","denatured form","RIA","swine","levels","competitive radioimmunoassay","monoclonal antibodies","characterization","natural host","MAb resistant","results","mutants","reactivity","dominant determinants","total","fusions"],"language":"en"},

In particular, it was thought that neurons were protected from direct attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) because they do not express major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules, at least at steady state. To date, most of our current knowledge on the specifics of neuron-CTL interaction is based on studies artificially inducing MHC I expression on neurons, loading them with exogenous peptide and applying CTL clones or lines often differentiated in culture. Thus, much remains to be uncovered regarding the modalities of the interaction between infected neurons and antiviral CD8 T cells in the course of a natural disease. Here, we used the model of neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic Borna disease virus (BDV), in which virus-specific CTL have been demonstrated as the main immune effectors triggering disease. We tested the pathogenic properties of brain-isolated CD8 T cells against pure neuronal cultures infected with BDV. We observed that BDV infection of cortical neurons triggered a significant up regulation of MHC I molecules, rendering them susceptible to recognition by antiviral CTL, freshly isolated from the brains of acutely infected rats. Using real-time imaging, we analyzed the spatio-temporal relationships between neurons and CTL. Brain-isolated CTL exhibited a reduced mobility and established stable contacts with BDV-infected neurons, in an antigen- and MHC-dependent manner. This interaction induced rapid morphological changes of the neurons, without immediate killing or impairment of electrical activity. Early signs of neuronal apoptosis were detected only hours after this initial contact. Thus, our results show that infected neurons can be recognized efficiently by brain-isolated antiviral CD8 T cells and uncover the unusual modalities of CTL-induced neuronal damage.","publish_time":"2011-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevalier, Gr\u00E9goire; Suberbielle, Elsa; Monnet, C\u00E9line; Duplan, Val\u00E9rie; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Farrugia, Fanny; Le Masson, Gwendal; Liblau, Roland; Gonzalez-Dunia, Daniel","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5016b361dce58077b3d647b0772425e079f98d8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219726.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22114563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","CTL","BDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BDV-infected neurons","antiviral CTL","CTL interaction","Brain-isolated CTL","CTL clones","BDV infection of cortical neurons","unusual modalities of CTL","virus-specific CTL","isolated CD8 T cells","brain-isolated antiviral CD8 T cells","infected rats","neuronal damage","regulation of MHC","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","molecules","immune system","significant damage","MHC-dependent manner","natural disease","neurotropic Borna disease virus","pure neuronal cultures","pathogenic properties of brain","Early signs of neuronal apoptosis","central nervous system","main immune effectors","reduced mobility","stable contacts","course","immediate killing","direct attack","CNS","specifics of neuron","antigen","recognition","express major histocompatibility class","impairment of electrical activity","exogenous peptide","rapid morphological changes","spatio-temporal relationships","current knowledge","model of neuroinflammation","hours","lines","studies","brains","challenge","expression","initial contact","real-time imaging","date","steady state","results","capacities of renewal"],"language":"en"},

Upon the appearance of clinical signs, a cure for the infected animal is impossible. Therefore rapid and proper diagnosis for both the presence of the causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis is of paramount importance. In the present work, a novel real-time RT-PCR method is described which is able to detect FCoV and to determine simultaneously the quantity of the viral RNA. The new assay combines the M gene subgenomic messenger RNA (sg-mRNA) detection and the quantitation of the genome copies of FCoV. In order to detect the broadest spectrum of potential FCoV variants and to achieve the most accurate results in the detection ability the new assay is applying the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) principle. This technology was chosen since PriProET is very robust to tolerate the nucleotide substitutions in the target area. Therefore, this technology provides a very broad-range system, which is able to detect simultaneously many variants of the virus(es) even if the target genomic regions show large scale of variations. The detection specificity of the new assay was proven by positive amplification from a set of nine different FCoV strains and negative from the tested non-coronaviral targets. Examination of faecal samples of healthy young cats, organ samples of perished animals, which suffered from feline infectious peritonitis, and cat leukocytes from uncertain clinical cases were also subjected to the assay. The sensitivity of the P-sg-QPCR method was high, since as few as 10 genome copies of FCoV were detected. The quantitative sg-mRNA detection method revealed more than 10\u201350,000 times increase of the M gene sg-mRNA in organ materials of feline infectious peritonitis cases, compared to those of the enteric FCoV variants present in the faeces of normal, healthy cats. These results indicate the applicability of the new P-sg-QPCR test as a powerful novel tool for the better detection and quantitation of FCoV and for the improved diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis, this important disease of the Felidae, causing serious losses in the cat populations at a global scale.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horny\u00E1k, \u00C1kos; B\u00E1lint, \u00C1d\u00E1m; Farsang, Attila; Balka, Gyula; Hakhverdyan, Mikhayil; Rasmussen, Thomas Bruun; Blomberg, Jonas; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1546d1e182af6c416abe66319b6464083d730a5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22349594/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412000365; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.01.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412000365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantitation of FCoV","manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","new assay","genome copies of FCoV","improved diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis","new P-sg","organ materials of feline infectious peritonitis cases","feline coronavirus","enteric FCoV variants present","quantitative sg-mRNA detection method","gene sg-mRNA","different FCoV strains","better detection","detection ability","detection specificity","broadest spectrum of potential FCoV variants","QPCR method","healthy cats","Felidae","PriProET","technology","uncertain clinical cases","novel real-time RT-PCR method","organ samples of perished animals","cat leukocytes","QPCR test","cat populations","Examination of faecal samples of healthy young cats","gene subgenomic messenger RNA","present work","target area","global scale","proper diagnosis","viral RNA","accurate results","powerful novel tool","target genomic regions","large scale of variations","appearance of clinical signs","cure","faeces of normal","primer-probe energy transfer","important disease","set","presence","causative agent","tested non-coronaviral targets","serious losses","positive amplification","nucleotide substitutions","principle","applicability","paramount importance","infected animal","broad-range system","severe devastating diseases","quantity","order","sensitivity","times"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this clinical trial was to determine the effect of colostrum supplementation of the milk replacer ration on morbidity, mortality, feed intake, and weight gain of preweaned calves. Ninety 1-d-old calves on each of 3 commercial calf ranches were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups. Treatment-group calves received 10g of supplemental immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the form of 70g of colostrum powder in the milk replacer twice daily for 14 d. The placebo-group calves received a nutritionally equivalent supplement lacking IgG in the milk replacer twice daily for 14 d. Control calves received milk replacer without supplements twice daily. Calves were housed in individual hutches and were weighed on d 1, 28, and 60. Serum was collected on d 2 for serum IgG determination. Daily health evaluations for the first 28 d of life were performed by study personnel blinded to treatment group assignment. Observed illness was treated based on health assessment, rectal temperature, and specific calf ranch protocols. Feed consumption (milk and grain) was recorded. Calves receiving supplemental colostrum had less diarrhea and received fewer antimicrobial treatments than control and placebo calves. The results indicated that calf diarrhea was associated with low serum IgG levels and low-weight calves. Grain consumption and weight gain over the first 28 d of life were significantly greater in colostrum-supplemented calves compared with control calves. No differences in mortality or respiratory disease incidence among groups were detected. Supplemental colostrum during the first 2 wk of life can reduce diarrheal disease in preweaned calves on calf ranches and thereby reduce the amount of antimicrobial treatments needed.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berge, A.C.B.; Besser, T.

Severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections may be associated with life-threatening complications. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these severe clinical and pathological features remain incompletely understood. Lipids are known to play critical roles in multiple stages of the virus replication cycle. The specific lipid profile induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication. The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized. To this end, we performed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray ionization\u2013quadrupole\u2013time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS)-based lipidomics to characterize the change in host lipidome upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections. Our results revealed that 47 lipids within 11 lipid classes were significantly perturbed after EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Four polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), namely, arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), were consistently upregulated upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Importantly, exogenously supplying three of these four PUFAs, including AA, DHA, and EPA, in cell cultures significantly reduced EV-A71 and CV-A16 replication. Taken together, our results suggested that enteroviruses might specifically modulate the host lipid pathways for optimal virus replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids that disrupted this delicate homeostatic state could prevent efficient viral replication. Precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Bingpeng; Zou, Zijiao; Chu, Hin; Chan, Gabriella; Tsang, Jessica Oi-Ling; Lai, Pok-Man; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Yin, Feifei; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Sze, Kong-Hung; Lau, Susanna Kar-Pui; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e657fc1a1df1ac7f0e7f45a43d405cfda6cda48d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6928875.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20235952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPA","DHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CV-A16 replication","Severe EV-A71","Enterovirus A71","CV-A16 infections","reduced EV-A71","coxsackievirus A16","enterovirus infection","host lipid profile","optimal virus replication","host lipid pathways","virus replication cycle","potential host","host lipidome","docosahexaenoic acid","docosapentaenoic acid","arachidonic acid","eicosapentaenoic acid","lipid classes","specific lipid profile","efficient viral replication","host cell lipidomic profiles","DHA","AA","PUFAs","EPA","results","cell cultures","Excessive exogenous addition of lipids","electrospray ionization","quadrupole","ultra-high performance liquid chromatography","UPLC-ESI","mass spectrometry","time of flight","delicate homeostatic state","multiple stages","Q-TOF","foot","change","DPA","antiviral strategy","based lipidomics","critical roles","common causes of hand","perturbations","Precise manipulation","pathogenic mechanisms","pathological features","mouth disease","end","polyunsaturated fatty acids","enteroviruses","life-threatening complications"],"language":"en"},

If not for the 1997 avian A/H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong of China, subtype H2 is the likely candidate for the next pandemic. However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world. Migratory birds and, less likely, bird trafficking are believed to be globalizing the avian influenza A/H5N1 epidemic in poultry. More than 200 human cases of avian influenza virus infection due to A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 subtypes mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission have been reported with a \u003E 50% case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections. A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger another influenza pandemic. The recent isolation of this virus in extrapulmonary sites of human diseases suggests that the high fatality of this infection may be more than just the result of a cytokine storm triggered by the pulmonary disease. The emergence of resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and recently oseltamivir while H5N1 vaccines are still at the developmental stage of phase I clinical trial are causes for grave concern. Moreover, the to-be pandemic strain may have little cross immunogenicity to the presently tested vaccine strain. The relative importance and usefulness of airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in infection control are still uncertain. Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic. The control of this impending disaster requires more research in addition to national and international preparedness at various levels. The epidemiology, virology, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, management, and hospital infection control measures are reviewed from a clinical perspective.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Samson S.Y.; Yuen, Kwok-yung","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54bbe92b3ef8b2754ea0c79ff1d66bc3aa428803.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094746.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215315361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215315361","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","Southern China","China"],"keyphrases":["human influenza pandemics","human cases of avian influenza virus infection","pathogenic avian influenza","avian influenza H7N7","human transmission","laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2","H3 subtypes of influenza","H5N1 outbreak","H5N1 vaccines","H5N1 epidemic","H5N1 infections","pandemic strain","reassortant virus capable of efficient human","H5N1 genotype Z virus","extrapulmonary sites of human diseases","result of poultry","hospital infection control measures","clinical trial","clinical features","laboratory diagnosis","clinical perspective","previous poultry outbreaks","subtype H2","Southern China","likely candidate","H9 subtypes","high fatality","vaccine strain","Hong Kong of China","case fatality rate","management","addition","H1","international preparedness","amantadine","research","droplet","rimantadine","developmental stage of phase","virology","little cross immunogenicity","precautions","usefulness of airborne","virologic studies","adamantanes","various levels","cytokine storm","impending disaster","oseltamivir","relative importance","emergence of resistance","recent isolation","pulmonary disease","Seroepidemiologic","parts","grave concern","epidemiology","viruses","cause","Migratory birds","bird trafficking","depopulation","world","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used. OBJECTIVES: To develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets. STUDY DESIGN: The multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. RESULTS: The multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays. Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively. Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples. Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected.

This obligation extends not only to the provision of health care or to the control of infectious disease outbreaks, but also to the cessation of human rights violations that contribute to poor health or disease risk. The relationship between the health status of a population and the behavior of the government under which that population lives is important during war or civil crisis settings, and in the context of chronic health issues such as nutrition, famine, and child mortality. As measured by indicators such as accountability, stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, and the existence of an independent civil society, plays a significant role in health outcomes\u2014a role independent of, and perhaps even superior to, host genetics, insect vectors, or individual behaviors. Famines stem not solely from bad weather or genetics, but also from the failure of governments to protect their populations from civil strife, or to equitably distribute food aid. Despite the widespread acceptance of these findings, the influence of governance on infectious disease spread has received far less attention. Both governance and health can be measured in many different ways, and one factor complicating efforts to measure the association between the two is the difficulty finding accurate, sensitive, and specific enough indicators for either variable. Broad measures of population health\u2014such as life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality\u2014have been chosen by a number of authors, in part because these indicators capture multiple specific diseases and are broadly distributed across the population.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Jonathan; Amon, Joseph J.","journal":"The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/506be93ecec78b156103ddd221d533d6575512fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704665500200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704665500200","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poor health","health outcomes","health status","Broad measures of population health","provision of health care","indicators","context of chronic health issues","population lives","role independent","independent civil society","civil strife","infectious disease spread","disease risk","control of infectious disease outbreaks","civil crisis settings","fundamental obligation of governments","significant role","cessation of human rights violations","host genetics","influence of governance","maternal mortality","failure of governments","child mortality","multiple specific diseases","nutrition","war","insect vectors","rule of law","life expectancy","stability","chapter","respect","existence","factor","bad weather","findings","accountability","populations","individual behaviors","Publisher Summary","efforts","association","difficulty","Famines stem","different ways","widespread acceptance","attention","relationship","variable","food aid","number of authors"],"language":"en"},

Japanese field isolates of BCoV, reference Kakegawa strain, and vaccine strain 66/H were analyzed for their antigenic properties by indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization testing. There were no significant differences observed among these BCoVs in direct immunofluorescence tests. However, antigenic differences were observed between BCoVs in the neutralization tests, although there was no clear indication of a distinct serotype. A monoclonal antibody, 4H4, against the Kakegawa strain belonging to group 1 lacked significant neutralizing activity for viruses of groups 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, we speculate that the genetic differences between these groups may have altered their antigenicity. Analysis of mutant viruses resistant to neutralization by 4H4 revealed that the antigenic site of the Kakegawa strain maps to amino acid position 284 of the S glycoprotein. This site is not homologous to a known antigenic site (aa 528) of the Quebec strain belonging to group 1, and it is not located in the conformational domain comprising domain I (aa 351\u2013403) and domain II (aa 517\u2013621).

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: 1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; 2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; 3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; 4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; 5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.

Point of care PCR (POC-PCR) is a promising new technology for rapid virus identification but utility in the Emergency Department (ED) is not yet defined. Objectives Primarily, to investigate the value of POC-PCR in rapidly identifying RSV and influenza in the setting of ED triage. Additionally, to assess whether rapid knowledge of accurate test results would improve patient management by preventing nosocomial transmission and optimizing the prescription of antimicrobials for ARIs. Study Design A prospective cohort study of consecutive ED patients with ARI symptoms during peak flu season was conducted. Patient nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested using a POC-PCR device; physicians and patients were blinded to results. Virus positive and negative groups were compared by ED patient room placement and antimicrobial therapy ordered. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated using laboratory-PCR as the gold standard. Results Of 119 participants, 52.9% were POC-PCR positive - Influenza A (42.9%), RSV (41.3%), influenza B (15.9%). Nearly 70% of virus positive patients were placed rooms shared with non-ARI patients. Antibiotics were prescribed for 27.3% of virus positive patients, and 77.8% of oseltamivir-eligible patients did not receive therapy. POC-PCR was 100% sensitive (95% CI, 80.5\u2013100.0%) and 95.2% specific (95% CI, 76.2\u201399.9%). Conclusions Rapid POC-PCR for influenza and RSV in ED triage has excellent sensitivity and specificity and the potential to improve social distancing practices through better triage and increase appropriate prescription of antimicrobials.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Courtney J.; Rogan, Daniel T.; Yang, Samuel; Quinn, James V.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c725ffcc21661055351a1d120cce63d1690ee48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106347.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218302233; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218302233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261422/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.09.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["RSV","Study Design","ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["POC-PCR positive - Influenza","POC-PCR device","virus positive patients","laboratory-PCR","Conclusions Rapid POC-PCR","care PCR","value of POC","non-ARI patients","setting of ED triage","RSV","prospective cohort study of consecutive ED patients","rapid virus identification","oseltamivir-eligible patients","ED patient room placement","influenza B","ARI symptoms","better triage","patient management","Specificity","rapid knowledge of accurate test results","Patient nasopharyngeal swabs","appropriate prescription of antimicrobials","excellent sensitivity","antimicrobial therapy","utility","promising new technology","potential","social distancing practices","rooms","negative groups","Abstract Background Acute respiratory illnesses","etiology","peak flu season","nosocomial transmission","Emergency Department","significant morbidity","physicians","mortality","gold standard","ARIs","participants","Objectives","Antibiotics"],"language":"en"},

Two other HCoV (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) have been known for 30 years. HCoV-229E has been recently involved in nosocomial respiratory viral infections in high-risk children. However, their diagnosis is not routinely performed. Currently, reliable immunofluorescence and cell culture methodologies are not available. As part of a four-year epidemiological study in a Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive care unit, we have performed and demonstrated the reliability of a reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay to detect HCoV of the 229E antigenic group in 2028 clinical respiratory specimens. In hospitalized children (children and newborns) and staff members we found a high incidence of HcoV-229E infection. This reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay gave a high specificity and a sensitivity of 0.5 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose per ml.

New vaccine candidates are therefore urgently needed. Highly conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (PfRH5) has been identified as a potential candidate for anti-disease vaccine development. PfRH5 is essential for erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and crucial for parasite survival. However, there is paucity of data on the extent of genetic variations on PfRH5 in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. This study described genetic polymorphisms at the high affinity binding polypeptides (HABPs) 36718, 36727, 36728 of PfRH5 in Nigerian isolates of P. falciparum. This study tested the hypothesis that only specific conserved B and T cell epitopes on PfRH5 HABPs are crucial for vaccine development. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five microscopically confirmed P. falciparum samples collected in a prospective cross-sectional study of three different populations in Lagos, Nigeria. Genetic diversity and haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene were determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. Tajima\u2019s D and the ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations were utilized to estimate the extent of balancing and directional selection in the pfrh5 gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes of PfRH5 with negative Tajima\u2019s D and dN/dS value of \u2212 1.717 and 0.011 \u00B1 0.020, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP (G \u2192 A) at position 608 was observed, which resulted in a change of the amino acid cysteine at position 203 to tyrosine. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.318 \u00B1 0.016 and 0.0046 \u00B1 0.0001 while inter-population genetic differentiation ranged from 0.007 to 0.037. Five polypeptide variants were identified, the most frequent being KTKYH with a frequency of 51.3%. One B-cell epitope, 151 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II T-cell epitopes, four intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and six MHC class I T-cell epitopes were observed in the study. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed clustering and evidence of evolutionary relationship with 3D7, PAS-2 and FCB-2 RH5 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed low level of genetic polymorphisms in PfRH5 antigen with B- and T-cell epitopes in intrinsically unstructured regions along the PfRH5 gene in Lagos, Nigeria. A broader investigation is however required in other parts of the country to support the possible inclusion of PfRH5 in a cross-protective multi-component vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ajibaye, Olusola; Osuntoki, Akinniyi A.; Balogun, Emmanuel O.; Olukosi, Yetunde A.; Iwalokun, Bamidele A.; Oyebola, Kolapo M.; Hikosaka, Kenji; Watanabe, Yoh-ichi; Ebiloma, Godwin U.; Kita, Kiyoshi; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0af9d20cbdfd0114cf1fb10ad2b8ae46848dcec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6945540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzExOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","MHC"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["PfRH5 HABPs","haplotypes of PfRH5","PfRH5 antigen","T cell epitopes","T-cell epitopes","possible inclusion of PfRH5","haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene","B-cell epitope","Genetic diversity","extent of genetic variations","low level of genetic polymorphisms","falciparum samples","prospective cross-sectional study","field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum","anti-disease vaccine development","MHC class","specific conserved B","unstructured regions","inter-population genetic differentiation","Lagos","New vaccine candidates","position","conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue","negative Tajima\u2019s D","cross-protective multi-component vaccine","extent of balancing","Nigerian isolates of","Sequence analysis","Phylogenetic analysis","RH5 sequences","nucleotide diversities","single nucleotide polymorphism","high affinity binding polypeptides","major histocompatibility complex","merozoites","different populations","dN","erythrocyte invasion","evidence of evolutionary relationship","ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations","reliable alternative","3D7","sterile immunity","potential candidate","directional selection","amino acid cysteine","dS value","PAS","FCB","SNP","strain-specificity","malaria","IURs","hypothesis","bi-directional sequencing approach","parasite survival","country","studied antigens","Vaccines","change","tyrosine","RESULTS","paucity of data","KTKYH","frequency","parts","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","broader investigation","polypeptide variants","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The incidence of CR-BSI among neonates in Hung Vuong Hospital was higher than that of other neonatal care centres in Vietnam. METHODS: An 18-month pre- and post-intervention study was conducted over three 6-month periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention for CR-BSI and to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. During the intervention period, we trained all nurses in the Department of Neonatology on BSI preventive practices, provided auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during catheter care and maintenance, and reorganised preparation of total parenteral nutrition. All neonates with intravenous catheter insertion \u226548 h in the pre- and post-intervention period were enrolled. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data. Blood samples were collected for cultures. We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR-BSI incidence rates and logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. RESULTS: Of 2225 neonates enrolled, 1027 were enrolled in the pre-intervention period, of which 53 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8399 catheter-days, and 1198 were enrolled in the post-intervention period, of which 32 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8324 catheter-days. Incidence rates of CR-BSI significantly decreased after the intervention (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.94). Days of hospitalisation, episodes of non-catheter\u2013related hospital-acquired infections, and the proportion of deaths significantly decreased after the intervention (p \u003C 0.01). The CR-BSI was associated with days of intravenous catheter (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.08), use of endotracheal intubation (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.27\u20134.06), and intravenous injection (OR = 8.50, 95% CI 1.14\u201363.4).

Initial CHMI studies showed significantly higher durable protection against homologous than heterologous strains, suggesting the presence of strain-specific vaccine-induced protection. However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequences in each strain relative to the reference 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome. Strains were compared to each other and to a collection of clinical isolates (sequenced as part of this study or from public repositories) from South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. RESULTS: While few variants were detected between 3D7 and NF54, we identified tens of thousands of variants between NF54 and the three heterologous strains. These variants include SNPs, indels, and small structural variants that fall in regulatory and immunologically important regions, including transcription factors (such as PfAP2-L and PfAP2-G) and pre-erythrocytic antigens that may be key for sporozoite vaccine-induced protection. Additionally, these variants directly contributed to diversity in immunologically important regions of the genomes as detected through in silico CD8(\u002B) T cell epitope predictions. Of all heterologous strains, NF135.C10 had the highest number of unique predicted epitope sequences when compared to NF54. Comparison to global clinical isolates revealed that these four strains are representative of their geographic origin despite long-term culture adaptation; of note, NF135.C10 is from an admixed population, and not part of recently formed subpopulations resistant to artemisinin-based therapies present in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. CONCLUSIONS: These results will assist in the interpretation of vaccine efficacy of whole-organism vaccines against homologous and heterologous CHMI.

The optimal vaccination age and minimal lifetime expected risk of hospitalisation are found by adapting a method due to Hethcote (Math Biosci 89:29\u201352). Any number and combination of the four dengue serotypes DENv1\u20134 is considered. Successful vaccination against a serotype corresponds to a silent infection. The effects of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and permanent cross-immunity after two heterologous infections are studied. ADE is assumed to imply risk-free primary infections, while permanent cross-immunity implies risk-free tertiary and quaternary infections. Data from trials of Dengvaxia indicate vaccine efficacy to be age and serostatus dependent and vaccination of seronegative individuals to induce an increased risk of hospitalisation. Some of the scenarios are therefore reconsidered taking these findings into account. The optimal vaccination age is compared to that achievable under the current age restriction of the vaccine. If vaccination is not considered to induce risk, optimal vaccination ages are very low. The assumption of ADE generally leads to a higher optimal vaccination age in this case. For a single serotype vaccination is not recommended in the case of ADE. Permanent cross-immunity results in a slightly lower optimal vaccination age. If vaccination induces a risk, the optimal vaccination ages are much higher, particularly for permanent cross-immunity. ADE has no effect on the optimal vaccination age when permanent cross-immunity is considered; otherwise, it leads to a slight increase in optimal vaccination age.

There was no agreement between VAT and VAE, and the agreement was poor between VAP and VAE (k = 0.12, 95% CI 0.03\u20130.20). VAE and VA-LRTI were associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. VAP, VAT and VAE were not significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement was poor between VAE and VAP. No agreement was found between VAE and VAT. VAE episodes were significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, but not with ICU mortality.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pouly, Olivier; Lecailtel, Sylvain; Six, Sophie; Pr\u00E9au, S\u00E9bastien; Wallet, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Nseir, Saad; Rouz\u00E9, Anahita","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2e6d1a3fdf4bbbe50a45a0ae282aef0182bbeab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6957592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6957592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAE","VAP","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ventilator-days","ventilator-associated events","ventilator-associated pneumonia","ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis","VAP","VAE episodes","VAT","agreement","VA-LRTI","lower respiratory tract infections","longer duration of mechanical ventilation","hospital length of stay","ICU mortality","teaching hospital","retrospective study","patients","concordance","bed ICUs","total","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","aim","METHODS","multivariate analysis","impact","CONCLUSIONS","year period","outcome","statistics"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies demonstrate that analysis of continuous VS trends can predict sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cardiorespiratory decompensation, and mortality. Subtle changes in continuous VS patterns may not be discerned even by experienced clinicians reviewing spot VS data or VS trends captured in the monitor. In contrast, objective analysis of continuous VS data can improve neonatal outcomes by allowing heightened vigilance or preemptive interventions. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have used continuous analysis of single or multiple VS, their interactions, and combined VS and clinical analytic tools, to predict or detect neonatal pathophysiology. We make the case that big-data analytics are promising, and with continued improvements, can become a powerful tool to mitigate neonatal diseases in the 21(st) century.","publish_time":"2019-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Navin; Akangire, Gangaram; Sullivan, Brynne; Fairchild, Karen; Sampath, Venkatesh","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f6ccfdab548a075188f8c6e5d38b7f6d9044f2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6962536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combined VS","multiple VS","continuous VS patterns","analysis of continuous VS trends","spot VS data","objective analysis of continuous VS data","continuous analysis of single","neonatal outcomes","neonatal diseases","neonatal pathophysiology","complex changes","Subtle changes","neonatal intensive care unit","big-data analytics","heart rate","respiratory rate","Recent studies","persistent deviations","brain injury","absolute values","bronchopulmonary dysplasia","circadian rhythms","necrotizing enterocolitis","NICU","sepsis","oxygen saturation","infant physiology","variability","interactions","cardiorespiratory decompensation","heightened vigilance","clinical analytic tools","powerful tool","vital signs","experienced clinicians","contrast","preemptive interventions","continued improvements","mortality","case","chronic pathology","infants","blood pressure","birth","critical illness"],"language":"en"},

Five different methods for estimating ED visits for respiratory illness from Telehealth Ontario calls are compared, including two non-linear modeling methods. Daily visit estimates up to 14 days in advance were made at the health unit level for all 36 Ontario health units. Methods: Telehealth calls from June 1, 2004 to March 14, 2006 were included. Estimates generated by regression, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Numerical Methods for Subspace State Space Identification (N4SID), Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS), and Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI) were compared to the actual number of ED visits for respiratory illness identified from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database. Model predictor variables included Telehealth Ontario calls and upcoming holidays/weekends. Models were fit using the first 304 days of data and prediction accuracy was measured over the remaining 348 days. Results: Forecast accuracy was significantly better (p\u003C0.0001) for the 12 Ontario health units with a population over 400,000 (75% of the Ontario population) than for smaller health units. Compared to regression, FOS produced better estimates (p=0.03) while there was no significant improvement for PCI-based estimates. FOS, PCI, EWMA and N4SID performed worse than regression over the remaining smaller health units. Conclusion: Telehealth can be used to estimate ED visits for respiratory illness at the health unit level.

As evident during the 2003 global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it is important to provide support for health care workers (HCWs) who are vulnerable during infectious outbreak scenarios. Here we focus on the identification and evaluation of existing support mechanisms incorporated within emergency plans across various jurisdictional levels. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of 12 emergency plans from national, provincial and municipal levels were conducted using NVIVOTM software. The plans were scanned and coded according to 1) informational, 2) instrumental, and 3) emotional support mechanisms for HCWs and other first responders. RESULTS: Emergency plans were comprised of a predominance of informational and instrumental supports, yet few emotional or social support mechanisms. All the plans lacked gender-based analysis of how infectious disease outbreaks impact male and female HCWs differently. Acknowledgement of the need for emotional supports was evident at higher jurisdictional levels, but recommended for implementation locally. CONCLUSIONS: While support mechanisms for HCWs are included in this sample of emergency plans, content analysis revealed few emotional or social supports planned for critical personnel; particularly for those who will be required to work in extremely stressful conditions under significant personal risk. The implications of transferring responsibilities for support to local and institutional jurisdictions are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019sullivan, Tracey L.; Amaratunga, Carol A.; Hardt, Jill; Dow, Darcie; Phillips, Karen P.; Corneil, Wayne","journal":"Canadian Journal of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b37f20a57311b68e0d2f6d509745056ef6093c7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NVIVOTM"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["emotional support mechanisms","update of emergency plans","sample of emergency plans","social support mechanisms","emotional supports","evaluation of existing support mechanisms","social supports","female HCWs","municipal levels","instrumental supports","Qualitative content analysis","higher jurisdictional levels","various jurisdictional levels","gender-based analysis","infectious outbreak scenarios","municipal leaders","predominance of informational","infectious disease outbreaks impact male","global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","SARS","Canada","health care workers","development","anticipation of different types of disasters","significant personal risk","stressful conditions","culture of preparedness","responsibilities","identification","need","institutional jurisdictions","critical personnel","BACKGROUND","NVIVOTM software","METHODS","Acknowledgement","CONCLUSIONS","implications","implementation","responders","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Limited exposure to violence is seen as a component of healthy living. However, there is limited understanding of violence from a public health perspective within rural communities. Rural refers to those communities with a population less than 10,000 outside the main commuting zone of a large urban area. Population health approaches, including the social determinants of health, are well supported by public health officials. Generating information about rural youth violence from a Canadian perspective would add to our understanding of these social determinants while providing guidance for policy and program development. Current understandings of youth violence are limited to an urban, and oftentimes, American perspective. An ongoing two-phase Canadian study on rural youth violence included qualitative interviews with 52 youth and the completion of a questionnaire that had been developed from the qualitative responses. The questionnaire has been completed by a larger sample of rural youth. The findings generated from this ongoing study will be useful in linking violence with social factors that impact health and thereby guide population health programs and policies. In this way, the role of public health to develop policies and implement programs will be directly influenced by evidence while addressing an ongoing public health concern.","publish_time":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kulig, Judith C.; Nahachewsky, Deana; Hall, Barry L.; Kalischuk, Ruth Grant","journal":"Can J Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d340cded5b649a5a30eb0df3cc8396b938867ca9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rural youth violence","public health perspective","impact health","role of public health","public health officials","social determinants of health","population health programs","ongoing public health concern","Population health approaches","limited understanding of violence","rural communities","Current understandings of youth violence","larger sample of rural youth","ongoing study","Canadian perspective","ongoing two-phase Canadian study","social factors","American perspective","policies","Limited exposure","questionnaire","qualitative interviews","qualitative responses","large urban area","longterm impacts","potential","significant issue","main commuting zone","individuals","guidance","policy","families","evidence","program development","completion","way","information","component of healthy living","findings"],"language":"en"},

It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 \u03BCM in CEM cells and up to \u003E100 \u03BCM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5\u2032-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 \u03BCM, a slight decrease (by \u223C20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration.

This study aimed to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of cases of nosocomial influenza compared with the remaining severe cases of severe influenza in acute hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) which were identified by surveillance. METHODS: An observational case-case epidemiological study was carried out in patients aged \u226518 years from Catalan 12 hospitals between 2010 and 2016. For each laboratory-confirmed influenza case (nosocomial or not) we collected demographic, virological and clinical characteristics. We defined patients with nosocomial influenza as those admitted to a hospital for a reason other than acute respiratory infection in whom ILI symptoms developed \u226548 h after admission and influenza virus infection was confirmed using RT-PCR. Mixed-effects regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted OR. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred twenty-two hospitalized patients with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection were included: 96 (5.6%) were classified as nosocomial influenza and more frequently had \u003E 14 days of hospital stay (42.7% vs. 27.7%, P \u003C .001) and higher mortality (18.8% vs. 12.6%, P \u003C .02).

Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rathore, Shailendra S.; Liu, Yinghui; Yu, Haijia; Wan, Chun; Lee, MyeongSeon; Yin, Qian; Stowell, Michael H.B.; Shen, Jingshi","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db4a4b2bde1bf1bb981bf87f9c6c25462834a25e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6990648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990648/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediated membrane fusion","membrane fusion reaction","Requirement of membrane","membrane bilayers","unrelated membrane","membrane-destabilizing peptide","juxtamembrane motif","conserved membrane-embedded motif","common feature of biological membrane fusion","Intracellular vesicle fusion","SNARE-SM","juxtamembrane region","SM proteins","vesicle-anchored v-SNARE","SNAREs","destabilizing peptides","soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors","close proximity","Sec1","lipid bilayer structure","target membranes","Munc18","hydrophobic residues","findings","work"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS. METHODS: Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified. Data on epidemiology and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients on HFOV were compared to patients on other modes of ventilation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients were included. In the first 7 days of PARDS, 122/328 (37.2%) patients were supported with HFOV. There were significant differences in baseline oxygenation index (OI) between the HFOV and non-HFOV groups (18.8 [12.0, 30.2] vs. 7.7 [5.1, 13.1] respectively; p \u003C 0.001). A total of 118 pairs were matched in the GM method which found a significant association between HFOV with 28-day mortality in PARDS [odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 4.4, p value 0.01]. VFD was indifferent between the HFOV and non-HFOV group [mean difference \u2212 1.3 (95%CI \u2212 3.4, 0.9); p = 0.29] but IFD was significantly lower in the HFOV group [\u2212 2.5 (95%CI \u2212 4.9, \u2212 0.5); p = 0.03]. From the sensitivity analysis, PS matching, IPTW and MSM all showed consistent direction of HFOV treatment effect in PARDS. CONCLUSION: The use of HFOV was associated with increased 28-day mortality in PARDS. This study suggests caution but does not eliminate equivocality and a randomized controlled trial is justified to examine the true association.

Effective prognosis and treatment depend upon the early diagnosis of H. contortus infection. To date, no widely-approved methods for the identification of prepatent H. contortus infection are available to identify prepatent H. contortus infection properly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant cold shock H. contortus protein (rHc-CS) during early and late infections of H. contortus in goat. RESULTS: Purified rHc-CS exhibited a clear band, with a molecular weight about 38 kDa. H. contortus eggs were not detected by fecal egg count technique from feces collected at 0 to 14 days post infection (D.P.I). However, eggs were detected at 21, 28 and 35 D.P.I. Hence, results of immunoblotting assay showed specific anti rHc-CS antibody detection in all goat sera collected at early stage (14 D.P.I) and late stage (21\u2013103 D.P.I) of H. contortus infection. Furthermore, no cross reactivity was observed against Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii or uninfected goats. Among several evaluated rHc-CS indirect-ELISA format variables, favorable antigen coating concentration was found 0.28 \u03BCg/well at 37 \u00B0C 1 h and overnight at 4 \u00B0C. Moreover, optimum dilution ratio of serum and rabbit anti-goat IgG was recorded as 1:100 and 1:4000, respectively. The best blocking buffer was 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) while the best time for blocking, serum incubation and TMB reaction were recorded as 60, 120 and 10 min, respectively. The cut-off value for positive and negative interpretation was determined as 0.352 (OD(450)). The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the rHc-CS, both were recorded as 100%.

Deliberate infection, however, creates challenging questions, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIS are new and ethical challenges may be heightened. Consultation with stakeholders is needed to support contextually appropriate and acceptable study design. We examined stakeholder perceptions about the acceptability and ethics of HIS in Malawi, to inform decisions about planned pneumococcal challenge research and wider understanding of HIS ethics in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted 6 deliberative focus groups and 15 follow-up interviews with research staff, medical students, and community representatives from rural and urban Blantyre. We also conducted 5 key informant interviews with clinicians, ethics committee members, and district health government officials. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived HIS research to have potential population health benefits, but they also had concerns, particularly related to the safety of volunteers and negative community reactions. Acceptability depended on a range of conditions related to procedures for voluntary and informed consent, inclusion criteria, medical care or support, compensation, regulation, and robust community engagement. These conditions largely mirror those in existing guidelines for HIS and biomedical research in LMICs. Stakeholder perceptions pointed to potential tensions, for example, balancing equity, safety, and relevance in inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest HIS research could be acceptable in Malawi, provided certain conditions are in place. Ongoing assessment of participant experiences and stakeholder perceptions will be required to strengthen HIS research during development and roll-out.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapumba, Blessings M.; Jambo, Kondwani; Rylance, Jamie; Gmeiner, Markus; Sambakunsi, Rodrick; Parker, Michael; Gordon, Stephen B.; Gooding, Kate","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02f5dc9501dde58e4eabf20e76880aa5a6b90d6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7003337.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003337/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["research staff","biomedical research","stakeholder perceptions","LMICs","pneumococcal challenge research","community representatives","inclusion criteria","certain conditions","Malawi","range of conditions","support","acceptability","stakeholders","ethics committee members","negative community reactions","robust community engagement","follow-up interviews","medical care","medical students","safety of volunteers","potential tensions","potential population health benefits","Deliberate infection","vaccine development","key informant interviews","Human infection studies","acceptable study design","district health government officials","informed consent","regulation","clinicians","compensation","wider understanding","balancing equity","procedures","deliberative focus groups","example","relevance","Ongoing assessment of participant experiences","challenging questions","urban Blantyre","decisions","existing guidelines","middle-income countries","BACKGROUND","concerns","findings","ethical challenges","METHODS","place","CONCLUSIONS","roll","RESULTS","Consultation"],"language":"en"},

Rather than being inactivated, ricin evades normal degradative pathways and kills both KCs and LSECs with remarkable efficiency. Uptake of ricin by these 2 specialized cell types in the liver occurs by 2 parallel routes: a \u201Clactose\u2010sensitive\u201D pathway mediated by ricin\u0027s galactose/N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u2010specific lectin subunit (RTB), and a \u201Cmannose\u2010sensitive\u201D pathway mediated by the mannose receptor (MR; CD206) or other C\u2010type lectins capable of recognizing the mannose\u2010side chains displayed on ricin\u0027s A (RTA) and B subunits.

Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (\u223C1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy \u003E95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinan, Adam M; Lukhovitskaya, Nina I; Olendraite, Ingrida; Firth, Andrew E","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c464442591d7777212f7ee389bcbfa362ddc8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7010960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","UCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Positive-sense RNA viruses","RNA bacteriophages","Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses","positive strand","forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF","Long reverse-frame ORFs","infecting viruses","negative strand","open reading frame","codon reverse complements","UCA codons","genomes","public data sets","plant transcriptomic data sets","sister group","family Leviviridae","longest known overlapping genes","coding capacity","family Narnaviridae","segments of coding","clade of narnaviruses","overlapping gene evolution","diverse group of eukaryote","novo origin of genes","mosquito-associated narnaviruses","arthropod","study","wide range of sources","release","broad relevance","UUA","specific avoidance of CUA","messenger RNAs","strongest evidence","narnaviral sequences","members","cytoplasm of infected cells","inability","proteins","GC3 bias","analyses","factors","cent","absence"],"language":"en"},

The risk factors for P\u0026I hospitalizations that are specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence of P\u0026I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level data to identify short-stay (\u003C 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay (100\u002B days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P\u0026I hospitalization per 100,000 person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression models. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P\u0026I in the principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P\u0026I varied between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced age (85\u002B years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents. CONCLUSIONS: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates of P\u0026I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk factors for P\u0026I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P\u0026I risk.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moyo, Patience; Zullo, Andrew R.; McConeghy, Kevin W.; Bosco, Elliott; van Aalst, Robertus; Chit, Ayman; Gravenstein, Stefan","journal":"BMC Geriatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ac0ec221ae6adbaa37d66ecc1dbe7deb3a395fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7011520.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7011520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicare","Beers","LTCF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["long-term care residents","incidence of P","subgroups of LTCF residents","highest P","day incidence rates of P","important risk factors","common risk factors","LTCFs","high risk","facility-level factors","LTCF-level data","hospitalizations","long-term care facilities","LTCF discharge","person-days","day IRs","index date","care quality measures","acute hospital","associated person","admission date","distinct profiles of post-acute","Minimum Data Set","infection prevention","Medicare disenrollment","Facility staffing","advanced age","lower crude","Medicare administrative claims","individuals of younger age","clinical characteristics","geriatric syndromes","baseline demographics","receipt of antibiotics","medication use","respiratory conditions","estimated associations","impaired functional status","morbidity","mortality","clinicians target interventions","control strategies","retrospective cohort study","pneumonia","Older adults","Cox regression models","Beers criteria medications","importance","influenza","years","METHODS","findings","death","populations","Differences","institutional settings","BACKGROUND","principal position","CONCLUSIONS","objective","RESULTS","variables"],"language":"en"},

Given the growing population of children with complex care needs (CCNs), this was an important area of focus within the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project, funded by the European Union (EU) under the Horizon 2020 programme. We examined the structures and processes of care in place for children with CCNs and identified key constituents for effective integration of care for these children at the community and acute care interface across 30 EU/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries. METHODS: This was a non-experimental descriptive study with an embedded qualitative element. Data were collected by a Country Agent in each of the 30 countries, a local expert in child health services. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis was undertaken of the free text data provided. RESULTS: A total of 27 surveys were returned from a possible 30 countries (90.0%) countries. One respondent indicated that their country does not have children on long-term ventilation (LTV) in the home, therefore, responses of 26 countries (86.7%) were analysed. None of the responding countries reported that they had all of the core components in place in their country. Three themes emerged from the free text provided: \u2018family preparedness for transitioning to home\u2019, \u2018coordinated pathway to specialist care\u2019 and \u2018legal and governance structures\u2019. CONCLUSIONS: While the clinical care of children on LTV in the acute sector has received considerable attention, the results identify the need for an enhanced focus on the care required following discharge to the community setting. The results highlight the need for a commitment to supporting care delivery that acknowledges the complexity of contemporary child health issues and the context of the families that become their primary care givers.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brenner, Maria; O\u2019Shea, Miriam P.; Larkin, Philip; Berry, Jay","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/200f162ff6557492747f09438f8cfcaa4551942c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7023713.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Child Health Appraised","EU","EU/ European Economic Area","LTV"],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["clinical care of children","specialist care","care delivery","processes of care","acute care interface","effective integration of care","complex care needs","primary care givers","number of children","responding countries","RESULTS","growing population of children","child health services","long-term home ventilation","free text data","Models of Child Health Appraised","CCNs","LTV","place","long-term ventilation","Country Agent","complexity of contemporary child health issues","European Economic Area","important area of focus","enhanced focus","acute sector","descriptive statistics","European Union","community setting","non-experimental descriptive study","project","key constituents","following discharge","families","context","MOCHA","family preparedness","EEA","local expert","embedded qualitative element","thematic analysis","considerable attention","coordinated pathway","transitioning","commitment","Horizon","surveys","core components","governance structures\u2019","programme","METHODS","total","themes","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","responses","respondent","years"],"language":"en"},

Since the first report in Malawi, numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the discontinuance led to re-emergence of chloroquine-susceptible P. falciparum, suggesting a possible role in future malaria control. However, most studies were cross-sectional, with few studies looking at the persistence of chloroquine recovery in long term. This study fills the gap by providing, for a period of at least 6 years, proof of persistent re-emergence/stable recovery of susceptible parasite populations using both molecular and phenotypic methods. METHODS: Ex vivo drug-susceptibility assays to chloroquine (n = 319) and lumefantrine (n = 335) were performed from 2013 to 2018 in Gulu, Northern Uganda, where chloroquine had been removed from the official malaria treatment regimen since 2006. Genotyping of pfcrt and pfmdr1 was also performed. RESULTS: Chloroquine resistance (\u2265 100 nM) was observed in only 3 (1.3%) samples. Average IC(50) values for chloroquine were persistently low throughout the study period (17.4\u201324.9 nM). Parasites harbouring pfcrt K76 alleles showed significantly lower IC(50)s to chloroquine than the parasites harbouring K76T alleles (21.4 nM vs. 43.1 nM, p-value = 3.9 \u00D7 10(\u22128)). Prevalence of K76 alleles gradually increased from 71% in 2013 to 100% in 2018. CONCLUSION: This study found evidence of stable persistence of chloroquine susceptibility with the fixation of pfcrt K76 in Northern Uganda after discontinuation of chloroquine in the region. Accumulation of similar evidence in other endemic areas in Uganda could open channels for possible future re-use of chloroquine as an option for malaria treatment or prevention.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balikagala, Betty; Sakurai-Yatsushiro, Miki; Tachibana, Shin-Ichiro; Ikeda, Mie; Yamauchi, Masato; Katuro, Osbert T.; Ntege, Edward H.; Sekihara, Makoto; Fukuda, Naoyuki; Takahashi, Nobuyuki; Yatsushiro, Shouki; Mori, Toshiyuki; Hirai, Makoto; Opio, Walter; Obwoya, Paul S.; Anywar, Denis A.; Auma, Mary A.; Palacpac, Nirianne M.

Little is known about the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem when administered by continuous infusion (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of two dosages of meropenem (3 g vs 6 g/day by CI) in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: Thirty-one patients (81% male, median (IQR) age 72 (22) years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Sixteen patients received 1 g/8 h and 15 2 g/8 h by CI (8 h infusion). Plasma and ELF meropenem concentrations were modeled using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of attaining (PTA) a free ELF concentration of 50% of time above MIC (50% fT\u003EMIC), which results in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance in experimental models of pneumonia. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of meropenem AUC(0\u201324 h) in the plasma and ELF was 287.6 (190.2) and 84.1 (78.8) mg h/L in the 1 g/8 h group vs 448.1 (231.8) and 163.0 (201.8) mg h/L in the 2 g/8 h group, respectively. The penetration ratio was approximately 30% and was comparable between the dosage groups. In the Monte Carlo simulations, only the highest approved dose of meropenem of 2 g/8 h by CI allowed to achieve an optimal PTA for all isolates with a MIC \u003C 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the dose of meropenem administered by CI achieved a higher exposure in the plasma and ELF. The use of the highest licensed dose of 6 g/day may be necessary to achieve an optimal coverage in ELF for all susceptible isolates (MIC \u2264 2 mg/L) in patients with conserved renal function. An alternative therapy should be considered when the presence of microorganisms with a MIC greater than 2 mg/L is suspected.

This called to mind previous evidence for an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental disorders. Pilot open trials suggested that BDV-1 infected depressed patients benefitted from antiviral therapy with a licensed drug (amantadine) which also tested sensitive in vitro. Here, we designed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) which cross-linked depression and BDV-1 infection, addressing both the antidepressant and antiviral efficacy of amantadine. METHODS: The interventional phase II RCT (two 7-weeks-treatment periods and a 12-months follow-up) at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Germany, assigned currently depressed BDV-1 infected patients with either major depression (MD; N = 23) or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 13) to amantadine sulphate (PK-Merz\u00AE; twice 100 mg orally daily) or placebo treatment, and contrariwise, respectively. Clinical changes were assessed every 2\u20133 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). RESULTS: Primary outcomes (\u226525% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohen\u2019s d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance. Amantadine was safe reducing suicidal behaviour in the first 2 weeks. Pre-treatment maximum infection levels were predictive of clinical improvement (AB, p = 0.001; PAG, p = 0.026; HAMD week 7). Respective PAG and CIC levels correlated with AB reduction (p = 0,001 and p = 0.034, respectively). Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p \u003C 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4\u201310 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 \u03BCg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate profound antidepressant efficacy of safe oral amantadine treatment, paralleling antiviral effects at various infection levels. This not only supports the paradigm of a link of BDV-1 infection and depression.

When tidal volume (V(T)) is kept constant, \u0394P may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. \u0394P may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension. This study tests the hypothesis that individualized high PEEP, when compared to fixed low PEEP, protects against PPC in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS: The \u201CDriving prESsure durIng GeNeral AnesThesIa for Open abdomiNal surgery trial\u201D (DESIGNATION) is an international, multicenter, two-group, double-blind randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 1468 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two intraoperative ventilation strategies. Investigators screen patients aged \u2265 18 years and with a body mass index \u2264 40 kg/m(2), scheduled for open abdominal surgery and at risk for PPC. Patients either receive an intraoperative ventilation strategy with individualized high PEEP with recruitment maneuvers (RM) (\u201Cindividualized high PEEP\u201D) or one in which PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O without RM is used (\u201Clow PEEP\u201D). In the \u201Cindividualized high PEEP\u201D group, PEEP is set at the level at which \u0394P is lowest. In both groups of the trial, V(T) is kept at 8 mL/kg predicted body weight. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of PPC, recorded as a collapsed composite of adverse pulmonary events. DISCUSSION: DESIGNATION will be the first randomized clinical trial that is adequately powered to compare the effects of individualized high PEEP with RM versus fixed low PEEP without RM on the occurrence of PPC after open abdominal surgery. The results of DESIGNATION will support anesthesiologists in their decisions regarding PEEP settings during open abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03884543.

Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia. METHOD: Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the \u201CMoving Epidemic Method (MEM)\u201D. RESULT: A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n = 455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15\u201344 years of age [\u2018Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 population\u2019, 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5\u201314 years of age [R = 49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from October\u2013December and from April\u2013June. CONCLUSION: Significant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype. Further study need to be considered to identify potential risks and improving the surveillance system to continue early detection and monitoring of circulating influenza virus in the country has paramount importance.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tadesse, Musse; Mengesha, Mesfin; Tayachew, Adamu; Belay, Desalegn; Hassen, Abdulhafiz; Woyessa, Abyot Bekele; Zemelak, Etsehiwot; Beyene, Berhan; Kassa, Wubayehu; Ayele, Workenesh; Teshome, Bethel; Mekonen, Mikias; Assefa, Zewdu; Moges, Beyene","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7766be5161e8387e773fcc05b27c8614d7a4945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

In this study, an acetylation modification was identified at the K108 residue of the NS1 protein of H1N1 influenza virus. To further explore the function of the K108 acetylation modification of the NS1 protein, a deacetylation-mimic mutation (K108R) and a constant acetylation-mimic mutation (K108Q) were introduced into the NS1 protein in the background of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), resulting in two mutant viruses (WSN-NS1-108R and WSN-NS1-108Q). In vitro and mouse studies showed that the deacetylation-mimic mutation K108R in the NS1 protein attenuated the replication and virulence of WSN-NS1-108R, while the constant acetylation-mimic mutant virus WSN-NS1-108Q showed similar replication and pathogenicity as the wild-type WSN virus (WSN-wt). The results indicated that acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein has an important role in the replication and virulence of influenza virus. To further explore the potential mechanism, the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonistic activity of the three NS1 proteins (NS1-108Q, NS1-108R, and NS1-wt) was compared in cells, which showed that the K108R mutation significantly attenuated the IFN-\u03B2 antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein compared with NS1-wt and NS1-108Q. Both NS1-wt and NS1-108Q inhibited the IFN-\u03B2 response activated by RIG-I CARD domain, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 more efficiently than the NS1-108R protein in cells.

Daily emotional regulation in reaction to constantly watching suffering patients may be intensified among those hospice professionals who have high levels of compassion fatigue. The main object of this study was to examine the relationship between daily exposition to seeing patient suffering and daily emotional work, and to assess whether compassion fatigue (secondary traumatic stress and burnout) buffers this relationship. METHODS: We used a diary research design for collecting daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering and emotional work display. Participants filled in a general survey and daily survey over a period of eight consecutive workdays. A total of 39 hospice professionals from two Italian hospices participated in the study. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses demonstrated that daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering was positively related to daily emotional work display after controlling for daily death of patients. Moreover, considering previous levels of compassion fatigue, a buffering effect of high burnout on seeing patients suffering - daily emotional work display relationship was found. CONCLUSIONS: A central finding of our study is that fluctuations in daily witness of patients suffering are positively related to daily use of positive emotional regulations. Further, our results show that burnout buffers this relationship such that hospice professionals with high burnout use more emotional display in days where they recurrently witness patients suffering.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Portoghese, Igor; Galletta, Maura; Larkin, Philip; Sardo, Salvatore; Campagna, Marcello; Finco, Gabriele; D\u2019Aloja, Ernesto","journal":"BMC Palliat Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e511a54cae27137320ebd2758560f77edd6af56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7043034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7043034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suffering patients","daily fluctuations","daily witness of patients suffering","daily death of patients","daily survey","daily emotional work display relationship","daily exposition","emotional display","daily use of positive emotional regulations","ill patients","patient suffering","emotional regulation strategies","hospice professionals","study","high levels of compassion fatigue","Hospice workers","buffering effect of high burnout","previous levels of compassion fatigue","RESULTS","general survey","secondary traumatic stress","period","diary research design","attempt","Italian hospices","Multilevel analyses","reaction","central finding","consecutive workdays","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Participants","main object","BACKGROUND","families","total"],"language":"en"},

However, this distinction is difficult to reconcile with the high conservation of the core machineries that regulate early secretory trafficking from yeast to man. Also, it has remained unclear whether the pleiomorphic IC components\u2014vacuoles, tubules and vesicles\u2014represent transient transport carriers or building blocks of a permanent pre-Golgi organelle. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that the IC maintains its compositional, structural and spatial properties throughout the cell cycle, supporting a model that combines the dynamic and stable aspects of the organelle. Moreover, the IC has been assigned novel functions, such as cell signaling, Golgi-independent trafficking and autophagy.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. A survey was conducted in which information was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy related to influenza was built to evaluate the level of health literacy regarding influenza prevention and control among residents in Beijing. Results Thirteen thousand and fifty-three valid questionnaires were received. The average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12\u00B13.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65\u00B11.20, 7.25\u00B11.94, and 2.21\u00B11.31, respectively. The qualified proportions of these three sections were 23.7%, 11.9%, and 43.4%, respectively, and the total proportion with a qualified level was 6.7%. There were significant differences in health literacy level related to influenza among the different gender, age, educational level, occupational status, and location groups (p \u003C0.05). There was a significant association between knowledge and behavior (r =0.084, p \u003C0.001), and knowledge and skill (r =0.102, p \u003C0.001). Conclusions The health literacy level remains low among the general population in Beijing and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Therefore, improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts. Educational level, as a significant factor in reducing the spread of influenza, should be considered seriously when intervention strategies are implemented.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Li; Seale, Holly; Wu, Shuangsheng; Yang, Peng; Zheng, Yang; Ma, Chunna; MacIntyre, Raina; Wang, Quanyi","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91f85fd66b90fad1835d46d97ce61ff23e4d7072.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110801.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214000393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735679/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214000393; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.01.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["level of health literacy","health literacy level","educational level","influenza prevention","pandemic influenza","qualified level","spread of influenza","behavior","sum of knowledge","general population of Beijing","skill responses","comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy","significant factor","significant association","significant differences","population of rural districts","cross-sectional study","qualified proportions","occupational status","control","different gender","extent of relativities","location groups","residents","Conclusions","terms of certain aspects","information","Summary Background","aim","average score","total proportion","mean scores","H1N1","Results","valid questionnaires","standardized questionnaire","improvements","sections","Methods","China","intervention strategies","survey"],"language":"en"},

Control of these organisms has largely focused within individual hospitals. We examine the extent to which transfers of critically ill patients could be a vector for the wide spread of highly resistant organisms, and compare the efficiency of different approaches to targeting infection control resources. METHODS: We analyzed the network of interhospital transfers of intensive care unit patients in 2005 US Medicare data and 2004\u20132006 Pennsylvania all-payer data. We simulated the spread of highly resistant hospital-acquired infections by randomly choosing a single hospital to develop a highly resistant organism and following the spread of infection or colonization throughout the network under varying strategies of infection control and varying levels of infectivity. RESULTS: Critical care transfers could spread a highly resistant organism between any two US hospitals in a median of 3 years. Hospitals varied substantially in their importance to limiting potential spread. Targeting resources to a small subset of hospitals on the basis of their position in the transfer network was 16 times more efficient than distributing infection control resources uniformly. Within any set of targeted hospitals, the best strategy for infection control heavily concentrated resources at a few particularly important hospitals, regardless of level of infectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care transfers provide a plausible vector for widespread dissemination of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms.

The mechanism of response to interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03B1) therapy under the condition of hepatic steatosis is unexplored. We investigated the effect of hepatocellular steatosis on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and IFN-\u03B1 antiviral response in a cell culture model. METHODS: Sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) and HCV infected Huh-7.5 cells were cultured with a mixture of saturated (palmitate) and unsaturated (oleate) long-chain free fatty acids (FFA). Intracytoplasmic fat accumulation in these cells was visualized by Nile red staining and electron microscopy then quantified by microfluorometry. The effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication and IFN-\u03B1 antiviral response was measured by flow cytometric analysis, Renilla luciferase activity, and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: FFA treatment induced dose dependent hepatocellular steatosis and lipid droplet accumulation in the HCV replicon cells was confirmed by Nile red staining, microfluorometry, and by electron microscopy. Intracellular fat accumulation supports replication more in the persistently HCV infected culture than in the sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) cell line. FFA treatment also partially blocked IFN-\u03B1 response and viral clearance by reducing the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 dependent IFN-\u03B2 promoter activation. We show that FFA treatment induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and down regulates the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor leading to defective Jak-Stat signaling and impaired antiviral response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that intracellular fat accumulation in HCV cell culture induces ER stress, defective Jak-Stat signaling, and attenuates the antiviral response, thus providing an explanation to the clinical observation regarding how hepatocellular steatosis influences IFN-\u03B1 response in CHC.","publish_time":"2012-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunduz, Feyza; Aboulnasr, Fatma M; Chandra, Partha K; Hazari, Sidhartha; Poat, Bret; Baker, Darren P; Balart, Luis A; Dash, Srikanta","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54ebc03fe88092d143f0758472adf54252d6c224.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3490746.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22863531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","FFA","IFN","CHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 antiviral response","blocked IFN-\u03B1 response","impaired response","stress response","hepatocellular steatosis influences IFN-\u03B1 response","impaired antiviral response","mechanism of response","HCV replication","IFN receptor","HCV cell culture","HCV replicon cells","HCV infected culture","effect of FFA treatment","effect of hepatocellular steatosis","Intracellular fat accumulation","dose dependent hepatocellular steatosis","condition of hepatic steatosis","Intracytoplasmic fat accumulation","Sub-genomic replicon","cell culture model","Stat2 dependent IFN-\u03B2 promoter activation","therapy","ER stress","lipid droplet accumulation","S3-GFP","defective Jak-Stat","Nile red staining","cell line","CHC","RESULTS","electron microscopy","microfluorometry","chronic hepatitis C","hepatitis C virus","interferon-alpha","IFNAR1 chain","chain free fatty acids","liver disease progression","Renilla luciferase activity","flow cytometric analysis","major risk factor","phosphorylation of Stat1","viral clearance","endoplasmic reticulum","clinical observation","oleate","type","real-time RT-PCR","palmitate","patients","METHODS","explanation","mixture of saturated","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays.

Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source of solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and target the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly.

Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 \u00C5 and 2.83 \u00C5 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding.

However, intensive research in recent years has resulted in better understanding of innate immunity as well as the discovery of many effector proteins, revealing its numerous powerful mechanisms to defend the host. Furthermore, this research has demonstrated that it is simplistic to strictly separate adaptive and innate immune functions since these two systems often work synergistically rather than sequentially.

We argue that the effect glycans have on infection dynamics has profound implications for many aspects of healthcare and policy, including clinical management, outbreak control, and vaccination policy.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Steven L.; McGuckin, Michael A.; Wesselingh, Steve; Rogers, Geraint B.","journal":"Trends in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/255719dc5b79d46c943650def09cba0b6e03fc66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125966.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X17302160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29079498/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X17302160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2017.09.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal glycans","surface glycans","effect glycans","glycans influence infection dynamics","individuals","FUT2","altered susceptibility","pathogen interactions","vaccination policy","mucosal surfaces","pathogen receptors","mediation of host","clinical management","outbreak control","aspects of healthcare","important mechanisms","profound implications","microbial stability","receptor-decoys","viral infections","functional copy","physical characteristics of mucus","fucosyltransferase gene","variable constituent","diseases","specific examples","diversity","importance","immunological markers","population"],"language":"en"},

The incidence and clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection in elderly persons and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease over a long duration is not well described. We determined the incidence and clinical impact of 229E and OC43 CoV in this population during 4 consecutive winters, and compared illnesses to influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Methods. CoV 229E and OC43 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology in 4 adult populations under surveillance for acute respiratory illness during the winters of 1999\u20132003. Cohorts included healthy young adults, healthy elderly adults, high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and a hospitalized group. Results. Three hundred ninety-eight CoV infections were identified, with annual infection rates ranging from 2.8% to 26% in prospective cohorts, and prevalence ranging from 3.3% to 11.1% in the hospitalized cohort. The incidence of infections with each strain was similar, although asymptomatic infection and viral coinfection was significantly more common with 229E than OC43 infection. Although the incidence and clinical manifestations were similar for each strain, OC43-infected subjects tended to seek more medical care, as OC43 was twice as common as 229E among the hospitalized cohort. Conclusions. CoV infections in the elderly are frequent, likely causing substantial medical disease burden.","publish_time":"2013-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Edward E.; Shin, Jae Hyun; Falsey, Ann R.","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2c14ed29cac5bf3d89d9ca8ec397b77368b392a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3805243.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23922367/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit393; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/208/10/1634/2502185/jit393.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OC43 CoV","OC43 infection","CoV infections","incidence of infections","healthy elderly adults","asymptomatic infection","hospitalized cohort","underlying cardiopulmonary disease","OC43-infected subjects","high-risk adults","healthy young adults","elderly persons","strain","clinical impact of coronavirus","clinical manifestations","annual infection rates","hospitalized group","substantial medical disease burden","consecutive winters","medical care","prospective cohorts","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory illness","serology","adult populations","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","surveillance","illnesses","influenza","viral coinfection","human metapneumovirus","long duration","prevalence","Conclusions","Background","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room. Ventilation must be optimized during the procedure, to limit patient oxygen desaturation. Drug assisted neuromuscular blockage is advised to reduce coughing during tracheostomy tube insertion.

However, it remained unclear whether circulating Vpr in patients\u2019 blood is biologically active. Here, we examined the activity of blood Vpr using an assay system by which retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (L1-RTP) was detected. We also investigated the in vivo effects of recombinant Vpr (rVpr) by administrating it to transgenic mice harboring human L1 as a transgene (hL1-Tg mice). Based on our data, we discuss the involvement of blood Vpr in the clinical symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). RESULTS: We first discovered that rVpr was active in induction of L1-RTP. Biochemical analyses revealed that rVpr-induced L1-RTP depended on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03B2. By using a sensitive L1-RTP assay system, we showed that 6 of the 15 blood samples from HIV-1 patients examined were positive for induction of L1-RTP. Of note, the L1-RTP-inducing activity was blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for Vpr. Moreover, L1-RTP was reproducibly induced in various organs, including the kidney, when rVpr was administered to hL1-Tg mice. CONCLUSIONS: Blood Vpr is biologically active, suggesting that its monitoring is worthwhile for clarification of the roles of Vpr in the pathogenesis of AIDS. This is the first report to demonstrate a soluble factor in patients\u2019 blood active for L1-RTP activity, and implies the involvement of L1-RTP in the development of human diseases.","publish_time":"2013-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iijima, Kenta; Okudaira, Noriyuki; Tamura, Masato; Doi, Akihiro; Saito, Yoshikazu; Shimura, Mari; Goto, Motohito; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Kawamura, Yuki I; Otsubo, Takeshi; Dohi, Taeko; Hoshino, Shigeki; Kano, Shigeyuki; Hagiwara, Shotaro; Tanuma, Junko; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Baba, Masanori; Iguchi, Taku; Yanagita, Motoko; Oka, Shinichi; Okamura, Tadashi; Ishizaka, Yukihito","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a09a978336b5c98928dbfb37b12da84d327bfe2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3751050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915234/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-10-83","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["L1-RTP activity","human L1","rVpr-induced L1-RTP","activity of blood Vpr","involvement of L1","induction of L1","involvement of blood Vpr","blood of HIV","sensitive L1-RTP assay system","roles of Vpr","circulating Vpr","patients\u2019 blood active","blood samples","effects of recombinant Vpr","hL1-Tg mice","protein of human immunodeficiency virus type","Viral protein R","positive patients","transgenic mice","mitogen-activated protein kinases","enhancer-binding protein \u03B2","development of human diseases","immunodeficiency syndrome","various organs","pathogenesis of AIDS","various biological functions","CCAAT","aryl hydrocarbon receptor","clinical symptoms","transgene","soluble factor","retrotransposition of long interspersed element","clarification","BACKGROUND","monoclonal antibody specific","Biochemical analyses","monitoring","kidney","CONCLUSIONS","report","note","data","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses DOI: 10.1111/j.1750\u20102659.2010.00198.x. Background We compared the efficacy of medical masks, N95 respirators (fit tested and non fit tested), in health care workers (HCWs). Methods A cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 1441 HCWs in 15 Beijing hospitals was performed during the 2008/2009 winter. Participants wore masks or respirators during the entire work shift for 4 weeks. Outcomes included clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza\u2010like illness (ILI), laboratory\u2010confirmed respiratory virus infection and influenza. A convenience no\u2010mask/respirator group of 481 health workers from nine hospitals was compared. Findings The rates of CRI (3\u00B79% versus 6\u00B77%), ILI (0\u00B73% versus 0\u00B76%), laboratory\u2010confirmed respiratory virus (1\u00B74% versus 2\u00B76%) and influenza (0\u00B73% versus 1%) infection were consistently lower for the N95 group compared to medical masks. By intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, when P values were adjusted for clustering, non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirators were significantly more protective than medical masks against CRI, but no other outcomes were significant. The rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience no\u2010mask group compared to the intervention arms. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the N95 arms with and without fit testing. Rates of fit test failure were low. In a post hoc analysis adjusted for potential confounders, N95 masks and hospital level were significant, but medical masks, vaccination, handwashing and high\u2010risk procedures were not. Interpretation Rates of infection in the medical mask group were double that in the N95 group. A benefit of respirators is suggested but would need to be confirmed by a larger trial, as this study may have been underpowered.

Since then it caused several outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates up to 90% and remains a serious Public Health concern and biothreat pathogen. The most pathogenic and best-studied species is Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). EBOV encodes one viral surface glycoprotein (GP), which is essential for replication, a determinant of pathogenicity and an important immunogen. GP mediates viral entry through interaction with cellular surface molecules, which results in the uptake of virus particles via macropinocytosis. Later in this pathway endosomal acidification activates the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL), which have been shown to cleave ZEBOV-GP leading to subsequent exposure of the putative receptor-binding and fusion domain and productive infection. We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on in vitro and in vivo replication of EBOV. Similar to previous findings, our results show an effect of CatB, but not CatL, on ZEBOV entry into cultured cells. Interestingly, cell entry by other EBOV species (Bundibugyo, C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire, Reston and Sudan ebolavirus) was independent of CatB or CatL as was EBOV replication in general. To investigate whether CatB and CatL have a role in vivo during infection, we utilized the mouse model for ZEBOV. Wild-type (control), catB(\u2212/\u2212) and catL(\u2212/\u2212) mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV with no difference in virus replication and time to death. In conclusion, our results show that CatB and CatL activity is not required for EBOV replication. Furthermore, EBOV glycoprotein cleavage seems to be mediated by an array of proteases making targeted therapeutic approaches difficult.","publish_time":"2012-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marzi, Andrea; Reinheckel, Thomas; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b05d3ede3351f8b3edb22c74b0cfe933ba408c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3516577.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23236527/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin"],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of EBOV","EBOV replication","EBOV species","effect of CatB","ZEBOV entry","ZEBOV-GP","virus replication","independent of CatB","CatL activity","EBOV glycoprotein cleavage","viral entry","results","mouse-adapted ZEBOV","viral surface glycoprotein","cell entry","Ebola virus","uptake of virus particles","array of proteases","outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever","Sudan ebolavirus","productive infection","mouse model","Zaire ebolavirus","cellular surface molecules","cysteine proteases Cathepsin B","humans","C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire","putative receptor-binding","fusion domain","Reston","lethal challenge","Bundibugyo","interaction","difference","subsequent exposure","serious Public Health concern","biothreat pathogen","case fatality rates","pathway endosomal acidification","targeted therapeutic approaches difficult","determinant of pathogenicity","mice","time","previous findings","family Filoviridae","cultured cells","important immunogen","macropinocytosis","control","death","role","Wild-type","conclusion","African continent"],"language":"en"},

The EBOV pathogenesis starts with uncontrolled viral replication and subversion of both the innate and adaptive host immune response. The multifunctional viral VP35 protein is involved in this process by exerting an antagonistic action against the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) response, and represents a suitable target for the development of strategies to control EBOV infection. Phage display technology permits to select antibodies as single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from an artificial immune system, due to their ability to specifically recognize the antigen of interest. ScFv is ideal for genetic manipulation and to obtain antibody constructs useful for targeting either antigens expressed on cell surface or intracellular antigens if the scFv is expressed as intracellular antibody (intrabody) or delivered into the cells. RESULTS: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in scFv format specific for the EBOV VP35 were isolated from the ETH-2 library of human recombinant antibodies by phage display technology. Five different clones were identified by sequencing, produced in E.coli and expressed in CHO mammalian cells to be characterized in vitro. All the selected scFvs were able to react with recombinant VP35 protein in ELISA, one of the scFvs being also able to react in Western Blot assay (WB). In addition, all scFvs were expressed in cell cytoplasm as intrabodies; a luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay performed in A549 cells showed that two of the scFvs can significantly hamper the inhibition of the IFN-\u03B2-induced RIG-I signaling cascade mediated by EBOV VP35. CONCLUSION: Five antibodies in scFv format recognize an active form of EBOV VP35 in ELISA, while one antibody also recognizes VP35 in WB. Two of these scFvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of VP35 in a cell system in vitro. These findings suggest that such antibodies in scFv format might be employed to develop therapeutic molecules able to hamper EBOV infections.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flego, Michela; Frau, Aldo; Accardi, Luisa; Mallano, Alessandra; Ascione, Alessandro; Gellini, Mara; Fanunza, Elisa; Vella, Stefano; Di Bonito, Paola; Tramontano, Enzo","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6727353.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-019-0554-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","CHO"],"locations":["Western Blot"],"keyphrases":["active form of EBOV VP35","EBOV pathogenesis","EBOV infections","recombinant VP35 protein","intracellular activity of VP35","scFv format specific","Monoclonal antibodies","intracellular antibody","multifunctional viral VP35 protein","selected scFvs","intracellular antigens","cell system","library of human recombinant antibodies","IFN-\u03B2","ELISA","Phage display technology","cell cytoplasm","cell surface","therapeutic molecules able","A549 cells","WB","artificial immune system","CHO mammalian cells","IFN-\u03B1","adaptive host immune response","Ebola filovirus","luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay","uncontrolled viral replication","Western Blot assay","Ebola hemorrhagic fever","early antiviral alpha","beta interferon","intrabodies","mAb","single chain Fragment variable","antagonistic action","subversion","coli","development of strategies","ETH","genetic manipulation","sequencing","suitable target","induced RIG","process","cascade","BACKGROUND","ability","RESULTS","intrabody","CONCLUSION","aggressive infectious agents","different clones","findings","addition"],"language":"en"},

Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: detecting, protecting, caring for, alerting, and referring the EBR patient. The interaction between clinicians and those responsible for the protection of the community was crucial. The SOPs validated by the SPILF and its affiliates were disseminated to a wide range of key stakeholders through various media including workshops and the SPILF\u0027s website. Conclusion SPILF can easily adapt and timely mobilize the EBR expertise in case of an alert. The present work suggests that sharing and discussing this experience, initiated at the European level, can generate a new collective expertise and needs to be further developed and strengthened.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coignard-Biehler, H.; Rapp, C.; Chapplain, J.

In the absence of SARS-CoV Mpro crystal structures in complex with these synthetic inhibitors, molecular docking tools have been employed to study possible interactions between these inhibitors and SARS-CoV Mpro. The docking results suggest two major modes for the initial binding of these inhibitors to the active site of SARS-CoV Mpro. They also establish a structural basis for the \u2018core design\u2019 of these inhibitors by showing that the 3-chloropyridine functions common to all of the present inhibitors tend to cluster in the S1 specificity pocket. In addition, intrinsic flexibility in the S4 pocket allows for the accommodation of bulky groups such as benzene rings, suggesting that this structural plasticity can be further exploited for optimizing inhibitor\u2013enzyme interactions that should promote a tighter binding mode.

Once the biomarkers become more clinically available, in a rapid ED setting as bedside point-of-care assays, quality of care will be enhanced, not only by means of diagnostics but also in prognosticating severity of illness.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aranke, Mayank; Mian, Asad I.","journal":"Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/474dc2fb25200e876eb6359c0e2ccd14ce4ebb0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105964.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1522840113000311; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1522840113000311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288643/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpem.2013.04.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biomarker-based assays","disease-specific biomarkers","care assays","disease pathophysiology","based metabolites","quality of care","biomarker-based approach","subsequent disease management","acute disease states","host of novel biomarkers","review","quick bedside diagnostics","bedside point","modern pediatric emergency medicine","emergency department","rapid ED","Viral respiratory infections","central nervous system infections","outcome of pediatric infectious diseases","sepsis","septic shock","chemokines","diverse set of cytokines","nitric oxide","growing need","diagnostic rapidity","emphasis","rationale","timeliness","prognosticating severity of illness"],"language":"en"},

We found several proteins that could interact with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). \u03B1-2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG), which is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations, is associated with inflammatory regulation. Cytochrome P450 Family 3A (CYP4F3A) is an \u03C9-oxidase that inactivates Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human neutrophils and the liver. We investigated the association between the polymorphisms of these two inflammation-associated genes and SARS development. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps of these two genes were built with Haploview using data on CHB\u002BJPT (version 2) from the HapMap. A total of ten tag SNPs were selected and genotyped. In the Guangzhou cohort study, after adjusting for age and sex, two AHSG SNPs and one CYP4F3 SNP were found to be associated with SARS susceptibility: rs2248690 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.51); rs4917 (AOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.02-3.34); and rs3794987 (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.10\u20133.68). To further validate the association, the ten tag SNPs were genotyped in the Beijing cohort. After adjusting for age and sex, only rs2248690 (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30\u20132.04) was found to be associated with SARS susceptibility. The combined analysis of the two studies confirmed tag SNP rs2248690 in AHSG as a susceptibility variant (AOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.37\u20132.09). The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data among the patients and healthy controls in the HCW cohort, who were all similarly exposed to the SARS virus, also supported the findings. Further, the SNP rs2248690 affected the transcriptional activity of the AHSG promoter and thus regulated the AHSG serum level. Therefore, our study has demonstrated that the AA genotype of rs2268690, which leads to a higher AHSG serum concentration, was significantly associated with protection against SARS development.","publish_time":"2011-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Xiaohui; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Hongxing; Liu, Xuan; Chen, Ting; Yang, Ruifu; Shi, Yuling; Cao, Wuchun; Li, Ping; Ma, Qingjun; Zhai, Yun; He, Fuchu; Zhou, Gangqiao; Cao, Cheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12af3b3c07569926eb1ce96ebd4d5bffd05ce54a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3163911.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycoprotein","Leukotriene"],"organizations":["SARS","Cytochrome P450 Family 3A","SNP","AHSG"],"locations":["Guangzhou","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["SARS susceptibility","SARS development","SARS-CoV","process of SARS","SARS coronavirus","SARS virus","AOR","AHSG SNPs","tag SNP rs2248690","AHSG promoter","rs2248690 genotype data","AHSG serum level","tag SNPs","inflammation-associated genes","higher AHSG serum concentration","susceptibility variant","CYP4F3 SNP","HCW cohort","sex","Beijing cohort","Guangzhou cohort study","association","CoV infection","statistical analysis","combined analysis","AA genotype of rs2268690","patients","studies","Leukotriene B4","healthy controls","adjusted odds ratio","CYP4F3A","LTB4","important role","transcriptional activity","endogenous cations","human neutrophils","\u03C9-oxidase","LD","maps","version","CHB","JPT","Haploview","nucleocapsid protein","Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein","Cytochrome P450 Family","linkage disequilibrium","macrophage deactivation","Genetic background","polymorphisms","protection","inflammatory regulation","confidence interval","liver","findings","total","HapMap","proteins","rs4917","rs3794987"],"language":"en"},

A new pathophysiological model describes the development of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) as the combined result of prenatal inflammation and hypoxic\u2013ischemic insult. Neuroinflammation and a systemic inflammatory response are also important features of NAIS. Identifying key players of the inflammatory system is in the limelight of current research. CASE PRESENTATION: We present four NAIS cases, in whom detailed analysis of intracellular and plasma cytokine levels are available from the first month of life. All neonates were admitted with the initial diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); however, early MRI examination revealed NAIS. Blood samples were collected between 3 and 6 h of life, at 24 h, 72 h, 1 week, and 1 month of life. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed with flow cytometry and plasma cytokine levels were measured. Pooled data from the cohort of four NAIS patients were compared to infants with HIE. At 6 and 72 h of age, the prevalence of IL10\u002B CD8\u002B lymphocytes remained lower in NAIS. At 6 h, CD8\u002B lymphocytes in NAIS produced more IL-17. At 72 h, CD8\u002B cells produced more IL-6 in severe HIE than in NAIS, but IL-6 production remained elevated in CD8 cells at 1 month in NAIS, while it decreased in HIE. At 1 week, the prevalence of TGF-\u03B2 \u002B lymphocytes prone to enter the CNS was elevated in NAIS. On the other hand, by 1 month of age, the prevalence of TGF-\u03B2 \u002B CD4\u002B lymphocytes decreased in NAIS compared to HIE. At 72 h, we found elevated plasma levels of IL-5, MCP-1, and IL-17 in NAIS. By 1 month, plasma levels of IL-4, IL-12, and IL-17 decreased in NAIS but remained elevated in HIE. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the cytokine network are present between NAIS and HIE. CD8 lymphocytes appear to shift towards the pro-inflammatory direction in NAIS. The inflammatory response appears to be more pronounced at 72 h in NAIS but decreases faster, reaching lower plasma levels of inflammatory markers at 1 month.","publish_time":"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bajnok, Anna; Berta, L\u00E1szl\u00F3; Orb\u00E1n, Csaba; Tulassay, Tivadar; Toldi, Gergely","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a60c19b5cc401e24f815f8924010e77bed7579d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6015463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933753/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1229-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAIS","HIE","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NAIS patients","NAIS cases","important features of NAIS","elevated plasma levels of IL","CD8 lymphocytes","month of life","plasma cytokine levels","CD8 cells","month of age","severe HIE","lower plasma levels of inflammatory markers","lymphocytes prone","inflammatory system","systemic inflammatory response","prevalence of TGF","pro-inflammatory direction","cytokine network","prevalence of IL10","ischemic insult","week","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells","development of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke","initial diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy","Blood samples","flow cytometry","combined result of prenatal inflammation","analysis of intracellular","highest risk","CD4","production","perinatal period","preventive","new pathophysiological model","therapeutic strategies","childhood","Differences","cohort","early MRI examination","prognostic","limelight of current research","CONCLUSIONS","key players","Neuroinflammation","CNS","infants","MCP","Pooled data","CASE PRESENTATION","pathophysiology","BACKGROUND","neonates","hand"],"language":"en"},

Ironically, it is the success of the field that has led to a renewed interest in xenotransplantation during the past several decades. To a large part, this has occurred because of the great scarcity of human organ and tissue donors. However, it has expanded to include the use of cells from animals into humans such as porcine islet cells for diabetes or extracorporeal perfusion of human blood through animal organs or cells. Similar to allotransplantation, issues regarding transmission of infections from the graft to the human recipient were brought up for consideration with these procedures in the 1990s (Michaels and Simmons, 1994; Chapman et al., 1995; Hammel et al., 1998; Fishman et al., 1998). A risk for infection exists with the use of any biologic agent regardless of whether it is from a human or an animal source. Accordingly, transmission of infections from human organs, tissues, or cells is a well-recognized cause of disease after allotransplantation (Ison and Grossi, 2013; Green and Michaels, 2012). As the human graft shortage continues, newer cellular therapies are explored. Thus, attention continues to be given to the potential use of xenogeneic organs, tissues, or cells for human maladies through xenotransplantation. The potential for novel zoonotic infections to emerge because of xenotransplantation (xenozoonoses or xenosis) led to a debate on whether the field should be permitted to progress. This chapter reviews the issues of xenotransplantation related to infections from animals to humans. Lessons learned from infections with prior nonhuman primate xenotransplantation and human allotransplantation are used to help inform about risks with newer xenogeneic procedures. In addition, information on known zoonoses is reviewed to better develop constructs to decrease the hazard of infection with these novel procedures.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michaels, Marian G.","journal":"Laboratory Animal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/079432ec14b5dca8d96a3852b2e7c61ac8c55bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150069.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095274000298; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095274000298","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Simmons"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human allotransplantation","human organs","human maladies","human recipient","use of cells","human graft shortage","transmission of infections","issues of xenotransplantation","extracorporeal perfusion of human blood","great scarcity of human organ","novel zoonotic infections","animal organs","potential use of xenogeneic organs","novel procedures","porcine islet cells","newer xenogeneic procedures","tissues","prior nonhuman primate xenotransplantation","animals","humans","Michaels","field","hazard of infection","animal source","newer cellular therapies","diabetes","well-recognized cause of disease","tremendous increases","Ison","Grossi","number of people","tissue donors","technical advances","known zoonoses","addition","information","Chapman","Simmons","constructs","past","xenosis","Lessons","risks","consideration","xenozoonoses","Hammel","debate","biologic agent","decades","chapter","Fishman","success","attention"],"language":"en"},

Promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MxA near the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) have been frequently associated with various viral diseases, including emerging respiratory infections. We investigated the expression profile of MxA transcripts with distinct first exons in human bronchial epithelial cells. For primary culture, the bronchial epithelium was isolated from lung tissues with different genotypes, and total RNA was subjected to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The previously reported MxA transcript (T1) and a recently registered transcript with a distinct 5\u2032 first exon (T0) were identified. IFN-\u03B2 and polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid induced approximately 100-fold higher expression of the T1 transcript than that of the T0 transcript, which also had a potential ISRE motif near its transcription start site. Even without inducers, the T1 transcript accounted for approximately two thirds of the total expression of MxA, levels of which were significantly associated with its promoter and exon 1 SNPs (rs17000900, rs2071430, and rs464138). Our results suggest that MxA observed in respiratory viral infections is possibly dominated by the T1 transcript and partly influenced by relevant 5\u2032 SNPs.

Consequently, the results generated by these assays will enhance the surveillance of respiratory illness and the study of the roles of RVs associated with clinical features and disease severity.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakauchi, Mina; Takayama, Ikuyo; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Semba, Shohei; Saito, Shinji; Kubo, Hideyuki; Kaida, Atsushi; Oba, Kunihiro; Nagata, Shiho; Odagiri, Takato; Kageyama, Tsutomu","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e9f24ce4a14bc9a0f4300ea62e1557d1bd0e2a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166982.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tested RV","UTR of RV","developed assays","diagnosis of RV infection","roles of RVs","detection of RVs","clinical specimens","tested enteroviruses","real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays","clinical features","real\u2010time fluorescent reverse transcription loop","C species","isolated viruses","isothermal amplification method","study","surveillance of respiratory illness","reactivity","genus Enterovirus","combined use","competence","sensitivity","family Picornaviridae","disease severity","untranslated regions","UTRs","specificity","Human rhinoviruses","majority","results"],"language":"en"},

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, Justin; Alhussaini, Anhar; Calvillo-Arg\u00FCelles, Oscar; Billia, Filio; Luk, Adriana","journal":"CJC Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac1fbf3ec0f7652948a7d0407587534ff0d7e6a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194983.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363334/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589790X20300433?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589790X20300433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BTR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["VA-ECMO","event of COVID","role of VA","related cardiovascular collapse","higher incidence of cardiovascular complications","cardiogenic shock","decompensated heart failure","multi-organ failure","acute cardiac injury","vasodilatory shock","pandemic","BTR","infection","echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure","selected cases of refractory CS","viral myocarditis","uncertain benefit","perceived benefit","fulminant myocarditis","treatment of coronavirus","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","role of veno","previous coronavirus outbreaks","proposed recommendations specific","risks of transmitting disease","obstructive coronary artery disease","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","coagulopathy","myocardial infarction","high-risk prognostic scores","arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","sepsis","poor","overwhelming concern","risk factors","guidance","age","prothrombotic state","potential clinical scenarios","healthcare systems","consideration availability of resources","published data","small subset of patients","expert consensus","resource scarcity","Additional considerations","bridge","therapy","case report","China","existing literature","recovery","decision"],"language":"en"},

In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: (i) Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with greater reported use of worry and punishment strategies and less use of social control strategies; (ii) Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with lower levels of trauma symptoms; and (iii) Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as mediators between CSA severity and trauma symptoms. The results suggest that thought control strategies, specifically increased worry and punishment, and decreased social control, play a vital role in understanding adjustment after CSA. Future research should examine the roles of these cognitive control strategies as possible avenues of intervention following CSA.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scarpa, Angela; Wilson, Laura C.; Wells, Anthony O.; Patriquin, Michelle A.; Tanaka, Akiho","journal":"Behaviour Research and Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094331.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005796709001363; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796709001363; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2009.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19573861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thought control strategies","punishment strategies","cognitive control strategies","increased use of social control strategies","CSA event","CSA severity","greater reported use of worry","increased worry","current trauma symptoms","greater levels of trauma symptoms","lower levels of trauma symptoms","Greater severity","potential mediators of adjustment","young women","undergraduate women","abuse experiences","understanding adjustment","cognitive techniques individuals","current retrospective study","histories of child sexual abuse","vital role","stressful events","possible avenues of intervention","unpleasant thoughts","roles","key findings","sample","Future research","results"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, an evidence-based approach to assess the suitability of indicators remains unexplored. Furthermore few approaches that exist do not investigate indicators of psychological resilience, which is emerging as an important component of societal resilience to disasters. Disasters are events which overwhelm local capacities, often producing human losses, injury and damage to the affected communities. As climate hazards and disasters are likely to increase in the coming decades, strengthening the capacity of societies to withstand these shocks and recover quickly is vital. In this review, we search the Web of Knowledge to summarize the evidence on indicators of psychological resilience to disasters and provided a qualitative assessment of six selected studies. We find that an evidence-based approach using features from systematic reviews is useful to compile, select and assess the evidence and elucidate robust indicators. We conclude that strong social support received after a disaster is associated with an increased psychological resilience whereas a female gender is connected with a decrease in the likelihood of a resilient outcome. These results are consistent across disaster settings and cultures and are representative of approximately 13 million disaster-exposed civilians of adult age. An approach such as this that collects and evaluates evidence will allow indicators of resilience to be much more revealing and useful in the future. They will provide a robust basis to prioritize indicators to act upon through intersectoral policies and post-disaster public health interventions.","publish_time":"2013-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Llanes, Jose Manuel; Vos, Femke; Guha-Sapir, Debarati","journal":"Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/997ebf63461efa3e7cb1fc3014fc957659705202.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3893382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359448/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069x-12-115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indicators of resilience","indicators of psychological resilience","robust indicators","disasters","suitability of indicators","operational indicators","increased psychological resilience","evidence-based approach","concept of societal resilience","disaster settings","important component of societal resilience","post-disaster public health interventions","disaster-exposed civilians of adult age","robust basis","intersectoral policies","features","injury","damage","human losses","local capacities","systematic reviews","female gender","qualitative assessment","decrease","cultures","capacity of societies","coming decades","shocks","likelihood","affected communities","selected studies","strong social support","climate hazards","results","events","Web of Knowledge","measurement","resilient outcome","future","approaches"],"language":"en"},

The public has linked the so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 with their experience of dirty hospitals, but the precise role of cleaning in the control of these organisms in unknown. Hence the importance of a clean environment is likely to remain speculative unless it becomes an evidence-based science. This proposal is a call for bacteriological standards with which to assess clinical surface hygiene in hospitals, based on those used by the food industry. The first standard concerns any finding of a specific \u2018indicator\u2019 organism, the presence of which suggests a requirement for increased cleaning. Indicators would include Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and various Gram-negative bacilli. The second standard concerns a quantitative aerobic colony count of \u003C5cfu/cm2 on frequent hand touch surfaces in hospitals. The principle relates to modern risk management systems such as HACCP, and reflects the fact that pathogens of concern are widespread. Further work is required to evaluate and refine these standards and define the infection risk from the hospital environment.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dancer, S.

METHOD: Following Arksey and O\u2019Malley\u2019s framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. RESULTS: MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. CONCLUSIONS: More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.","publish_time":"2019-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Shurong; Oldenburg, Brian; Li, Wenjing; He, Yanling; Reavley, Nicola","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6815452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655552/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-019-2307-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHL"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MHL research","evaluation of MHL interventions","China","majority of MHL tools","evaluation of interventions","future studies","relevant interventions","general mental health","mental health literacy","assessment of mental health-related knowledge","English-language journals","Chinese-language journals","research gaps","scoping review maps population-based surveys","English databases","reports of surveys","Chinese ones","anxiety disorders","general public","specific disorders","Proper validation of tools","peer-reviewed publications","Cochrane library","PsycINFO","O\u2019Malley\u2019s framework","Medline","geographic coverage","Web of Science","CINAHL","depression","Following Arksey","terms of numbers","high-quality study designs","randomised controlled trials","METHOD","BACKGROUND","psychosis","beliefs","decades","CNKI","WanFang","diverse settings","participants","suicide","behaviour change","focus","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","survey findings","details","psychometrics","half","attention"],"language":"en"},

Yet, public health and animal disease surveillance programs continue to operate independently. Here, we assessed whether recent emerging zoonotic pathogens (n = 143) are known to cause morbidity or mortality in their animal host and if so, whether they were first detected with an animal morbidity/mortality event. We show that although sick or dead animals are often associated with these pathogens (52%), only 9% were first detected from an animal morbidity or mortality event prior to or concurrent with signs of illness in humans. We propose that an animal morbidity and mortality reporting program will improve detection and should be an essential component of early warning systems for zoonotic diseases. With the use of widespread low-cost technology, such a program could engage both the public and professionals and be easily tested and further incorporated as part of surveillance efforts by public health officials.

In this study, the sample was positive for PEDV variant strains via the nano-nest PCR. The strain was successfully isolated from positive samples and was serially passaged in Vero-E6 cells. In addition, the strain was identified via electron microscopy observation, indirect immunofluorescence assay and infection experiment in newborn piglets and named PEDV CH/JLDH/2016 strain (Accession No. MF346935). Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene showed that the CH/JLDH/2016 strain was clustered into G2b subgroup. Comparing with the CV777 vaccine strain, amino acid sequence analysis of CH/JLDH/2016 strain showed that 15 nucleotides were inserted and 9 were absent in S gene, whose amino acid sequence it educed insertions of 5 amino acids((58)NQGX(61) and (145)N) and absences of 3 amino acids((164)RD(165) and (1204)Y). Our strain, in the SS2 epitope have no amino acid, variant while in SS6 epitope, Y changed into S in 776th amino acid. The results indicated that PEDV G2b variant strains have been emerged in Jilin province. The identification of new types of PEDV variant strains would stimulate the development of effective vaccines for the prevention and control of PED. The novel vaccines that based on these newly identified PEDV variant strains may contribute to the control of PED outbreaks in China.","publish_time":"2019-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Tongjia; Du, Shuaishuai; Cao, Dongmei; Pei, Zhihua; Guo, Yanbing; Shao, Hongze; Wang, Haijun; Wang, Kai; Hu, Guixue","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9032901a1b5bd7fae2acaa2a43ff422536a606fb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e6b6f113119099c3282dc7c5854fb03a2b2ba4da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106306.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818308293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905773/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.03.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818308293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","CH/JLDH","PED"],"locations":["China","Jilin"],"keyphrases":["PEDV CH","PEDV G2b variant strains","identified PEDV variant strains","amino acids","amino acid sequence analysis of CH","identification of new types of PEDV variant strains","JLDH","CV777 vaccine strain","S gene","control of PED outbreaks","novel vaccines","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","development of effective vaccines","SS6 epitope","SS2 epitope","Phylogenetic analysis","positive samples","northeast China","G2b subgroup","indirect immunofluorescence assay","infection experiment","newborn piglets","electron microscopy observation","swine industry","educed insertions","prevention","severe economic losses","nano-nest PCR","results","pigs","absences","pig farms","Accession","intestinal communicable disease","Jilin province","Vero-E6 cells","recent years","study","MF346935","NQGX","RD","addition","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Methods: MEDLINE was searched through May 2004 for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms \u201Ccough\u201D and \u201Ccommon cold.\u201D Selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were reviewed. Additional references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic were also reviewed. Results: Based on extrapolation from epidemiologic data, the common cold is believed to be the single most common cause of acute cough. The most likely mechanism is the direct irritation of upper airway structures. It is also clear that viral infections of the upper respiratory tract that produce the common cold syndrome frequently produce a rhinosinusitis. In the setting of a cold, the presence of abnormalities seen on sinus roentgenograms or sinus CT scans are frequently due to the viral infection and are not diagnostic of bacterial sinus infection. Conclusion: Cough due to the common cold is probably the most common cause of acute cough. In a significant subset of patients with \u201Cpostinfectious\u201D cough, the etiology is probably an inflammatory response triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (ie, the common cold). The resultant subacute or chronic cough can be considered to be due to an upper airway cough syndrome, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome.

Its use, however, is often limited by the instability of plasmids due to a transcriptional activity of eukaryotic promoters in Escherichia coli resulting in synthesis of products toxic for the bacterial host. Using a highly unstable representative infectious clone of Japanese encephalitis (JE) flavivirus, we tested a new approach in design of such problematic \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 constructs, which is based on minimizing unwanted transcription in the bacterial host. A plasmid containing full genome size JE cDNA under control of the minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter can be propagated in E. coli with growth and stability characteristics similar to that of constructs controlled by the T7 promoter. Transfection of this plasmid into susceptible cells leads to the establishment of a productive infectious cycle. Reinsertion of the CMV enhancer at the 3\u2032-end of the JE cassette substantially increased the specific infectivity without affecting the stability and growth characteristics of the construct. This approach can be useful when stabilization of infectious clones by modification of a viral cDNA cassette is not the feasible or suitable alternative.","publish_time":"2001-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishin, Vasiliy P; Cominelli, Fabio; Yamshchikov, Vladimir F","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2978685b4cf45c2cdc5e28559cacac625bbf9874.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127487.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170201003719; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170201003719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious DNA","infectious clone methodology","stabilization of infectious clones","productive infectious cycle","JE cassette","genome size JE cDNA","viral cDNA cassette","unstable representative infectious clone of Japanese encephalitis","growth characteristics","constructs","bacterial host","new approach","stability characteristics similar","RNA virus genome cDNA cassettes","Escherichia coli","transcriptional activity of eukaryotic promoters","transfected cells","susceptible cells","popular alternative","suitable alternative","CMV enhancer","unwanted transcription","T7 promoter","control","classical scheme","modification","synthesis of products toxic","minimal cytomegalovirus","flavivirus","establishment","design","specific infectivity","Transfection","end","instability of plasmids","Reinsertion","use"],"language":"en"},

The virus emerged in the US in 2013, resulting in severe production losses. Effective vaccine development against PEDV is a challenge. Inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy. Attenuated vaccines, while more effective, require a relatively long lead development time, are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks. To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44\u00B0C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities. We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model. Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro. Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets. Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not. The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions. Thus, the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for PEDV immunization.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Gagandeep; Singh, Pankaj; Pillatzki, Angela; Nelson, Eric; Webb, Brett; Dillberger-Lawson, Steven; Ramamoorthy, Sheela","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52a61f0348480cb8c5b29d22307b8a1449e64f0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6817509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV immunization","attenuated PEDV vaccines","vaccine virus","subjecting PEDV virions","Effective vaccine development","Inactivated vaccines","vaccinated piglets","vaccine preparation","Attenuated vaccines","Strong PEDV spike-protein specific","fecal matter of vaccinated pigs","RNAse treatment","piglet challenge model","heat","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","intact viral structure","fecal viral shedding","efficacy advantages of inactivated","intestinal pathology","diminished replication","questionable efficacy","safety concerns","neonatal piglets","intestinal lesions","diminished replicative abilities","intact electron microscopic ultrastructure","long lead development time","antigenicity","antibody responses","significant promise","current approaches","exposure","Vero cells","hypothesis","described approach","new field outbreaks","mortality rate","unvaccinated controls","genome","structural proteins","severe production losses","important enteric coronavirus","passage","study"],"language":"en"},

However, staying abreast of current disease outbreaks requires scouring a continually growing number of disparate news sources and alert services, resulting in information overload. Our objective is to address this challenge through the HealthMap.org Web application, an automated system for querying, filtering, integrating and visualizing unstructured reports on disease outbreaks. DESIGN: This report describes the design principles, software architecture and implementation of HealthMap and discusses key challenges and future plans. MEASUREMENTS: We describe the process by which HealthMap collects and integrates outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.g., Google News), expert-curated accounts (e.g., ProMED Mail), and validated official alerts. Through the use of text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map. We measure the accuracy of the classification algorithms based on the level of human curation necessary to correct misclassifications, and examine geographic coverage. RESULTS: As part of the evaluation of the system, we analyzed 778 reports with HealthMap, representing 87 disease categories and 89 countries. The automated classifier performed with 84% accuracy, demonstrating significant usefulness in managing the large volume of information processed by the system. Accuracy for ProMED alerts is 91% compared to Google News reports at 81%, as ProMED messages follow a more regular structure. CONCLUSION: HealthMap is a useful free and open resource employing text-processing algorithms to identify important disease outbreak information through a user-friendly interface.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freifeld, Clark C.; Mandl, Kenneth D.; Reis, Ben Y.; Brownstein, John S.","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6867f714765fc882d7ea309f923b77aec0196261.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3ab5908773a08949114a2822053ceeaee70f413a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2274789.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067502707003441; https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/15/2/150/2086063/15-2-150.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502707003441","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HealthMap.org","Google News"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Google News reports","important disease outbreak information","news media","automated system","disease categories","unstructured reports","ProMED alerts","accuracy","current disease outbreaks","number of disparate news sources","implementation of HealthMap","Unstructured electronic information sources","information overload","text-processing algorithms","use of text processing algorithms","variety of sources","classification algorithms","large volume of information","ProMED Mail","ProMED messages","official alerts","OBJECTIVE","outbreak data","design principles","automated classifier","geographic coverage","interactive geographic map","open resource","alert services","software architecture","misclassifications","key challenges","expert-curated accounts","filtering","level of human curation necessary","valuable inputs","Web application","user-friendly interface","public health surveillance","significant usefulness","querying","future plans","regular structure","CONCLUSION","location","evaluation","countries","MEASUREMENTS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It has been well-identified that MBL has antiviral effects via binding to seasonal influenza H1 and H3 subtype viruses. Influenza A (H7N9) virus, a novel reassortant virus to human population, possesses the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from duck and wild-bird influenza viruses and internal genes from poultry H9N2 viruses. As of Dec 7th, 2014, a total of 467 human infections and 183 fatal cases have been identified. Here, recombinant human (rh) MBL was tested for its binding and effects on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and NA activity inhibition (NAI) of avian H7N9, H9N2 and human H3N2 viruses. We discovered that rhMBL exhibited a strong binding to H7N9 virus as human H3N2 did at high virus titers. However, it performed a significantly weaker HI activity effect on H7N9 comparing to those of H3N2 and H9N2, even at a much higher concentration (3.67 \u00B1 0.33 vs. 0.026 \u00B1 0.001 and 0.083 \u00B1 0.02 \u03BCg/mL, respectively). Similarly, minor NAI effect of rhMBL, even at up to 10 \u03BCg/mL, was found on H7N9 virus while it displayed significant effects on both H3N2 and H9N2 at a lowest concentration of 0.0807 \u00B1 0.009 and 0.0625 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. The HI and NAI effects of rhMBL were calcium-dependent and mediated by lectin domain. Our findings suggest that MBL, the host innate molecule, has differential interference effects with human and avian influenza virus and limited antiviral effect against H7N9 virus.","publish_time":"2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Jinlei; Cao, Yang; Qin, Kun; Zhao, Xiaopeng; Wang, Donghong; Li, Zi; Xin, Li; Shu, Yuelong; Zhou, Jianfang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c54d2a79a4b63fa6dde823622d4196e21e04e37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092832.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X1500100X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X1500100X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634695/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus","human H3N2 viruses","avian influenza virus","avian H7N9","NAI effects of rhMBL","antiviral effects","human population","human infections","recombinant human","poultry H9N2 viruses","significant effects","novel reassortant virus","high virus titers","\u03BCg","wild-bird influenza viruses","strong binding","minor NAI effect of rhMBL","differential interference effects","H3 subtype viruses","Abstract Mannose-binding lectin","weaker HI activity effect","seasonal influenza H1","limited antiviral effect","NA activity inhibition","internal genes","hemagglutination inhibition","lectin domain","lowest concentration","higher concentration","host innate molecule","pattern-recognition molecule","serum","duck","specific hexose sugars rich","N-acetylglucosamine","neuraminidase","yeasts","surface hemagglutinin","bacterium","calcium-dependent","HA","fatal cases","apoptotic cells","findings","total"],"language":"en"},

The present study was aimed to investigate the possible production of specific IgYs against Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks. Salmonella spp.-free female Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were intramuscularly immunized with formalin or heat-inactivated Salmonella immunogens (1.0 \u00D7 109 CFU/mL) emulsified with Freund adjuvants. Egg yolk IgYs were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation method. Anti-Salmonella IgYs titer and specificity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis. Salmonella specific IgYs detected in the immunized quails were significantly higher than those of the control group, which confirmed the immunization procedure. Specific IgYs against S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were identified in both groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens. However, formalin-inactivated immunogens induced relatively higher immune responses over the heat-inactivated ones. Quail anti-Salmonella IgYs showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens, with moderate cross-reactivity to other members of Enterobacteriaceae family.

The ICTS was found to be highly specific for antibodies against rabies virus, with a detection limit of 0.5IU/ml as measured by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test. Compared with the FAVN test, the specificity and sensitivity of ICTS were 98.2% and 90.4%, respectively. There was an excellent agreement between results obtained by the ICTS and FAVN tests (kappa=0.888). Strips stored at 4\u00B0C in a plastic bag with a desiccant retained their specificity and sensitivity for at least 15 months, and strips stored at ambient temperature remained stable for 12 months.

They have polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genomes and belong to the order Nidovirales, a diverse group of viruses for which common ancestry was inferred from the common principles underlying their genome organization and expression, and from the conservation of an array of core replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronavirus genomes (~26\u201332 kilobases) are the largest RNA genomes known to date and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. The primary functions that direct coronavirus RNA synthesis and processing reside in nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 to nsp16, which are cleavage products of two large replicase polyproteins translated from the coronavirus genome. Significant progress has now been made regarding their structural and functional characterization, stimulated by technical advances like improved methods for bioinformatics and structural biology, in vitro enzyme characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of coronavirus genomes. Coronavirus replicase functions include more or less universal activities of plus-stranded RNA viruses, like an RNA polymerase (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13), but also a number of rare or even unique domains involved in mRNA capping (nsp14, nsp16) and fidelity control (nsp14). Several smaller subunits (nsp7\u2013nsp10) act as crucial cofactors of these enzymes and contribute to the emerging \u201Cnsp interactome.\u201D Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of coronaviruses will be key to rationalizing their evolutionary success and the development of improved control strategies.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snijder, E.

Emerging evidence suggests that PHEV alters microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, and miRNA has also been postulated to be involved in its pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not been fully explored. In this study, we found that PHEV infection upregulates miR-142a-3p RNA expression in N2a cells and in the CNS of mice. Downregulation of miR-142a-3p by an miRNA inhibitor led to a significant repression of viral proliferation, implying that it acts as a positive regulator of PHEV proliferation. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-142a-3p was found to bind directly bound to the 3\u2019 untranslated region (3\u2019UTR) of Rab3a mRNA and downregulate its expression. Knockdown of Rab3a expression by transfection with an miR-142a-3p mimic or Rab3a siRNA significantly increased PHEV replication in N2a cells. Conversely, the use of an miR-142a-3p inhibitor or overexpression of Rab3a resulted in a marked restriction of viral production at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data demonstrate that miR-142a-3p promotes PHEV proliferation by directly targeting Rab3a mRNA, and this provides new insights into the mechanisms of PHEV-related pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Peng; Guan, Jiyu; He, Wenqi; Lv, Xiaoling; Hu, Shiyu; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Gao, Feng; Li, Fang; Fan, Gencheng; He, Hongbin; Li, Zi","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e95409c7268ba635d0162bed18b78766006aca6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087191.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-019-04470-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31834525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of PHEV","PHEV infection","Rab3a mRNA","p inhibitor","p RNA expression","p mimic","Downregulation of miR","Knockdown of Rab3a expression","increased PHEV replication","Rab3a siRNA","overexpression of Rab3a","positive regulator of PHEV proliferation","miRNA inhibitor","expression profiles","N2a cells","significant repression of viral proliferation","related pathogenesis","CNS of mice","virus-host interactions","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","marked restriction of viral production","microRNA","piglets","central nervous system","new insights","typical neurotropic coronavirus","dual-luciferase reporter assay","UTR","transfection","vomiting","Emerging evidence","protein level","untranslated region","disease","study","process","use","data"],"language":"en"},

To better recognise the trends and characteristics of toxocariasis research, this study is a bibliometric analysis of the global toxocariasis research. METHODS: Searches were completed on April 5, 2016, using the Scopus database. A search without any language restriction was performed to extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Terms related to toxocariasis were used to perform a title keyword search. RESULTS: A total of 2765 publications comprising 11 document types and published between 1932 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Articles were the most popular document form, accounting for 83.62% of all publications, followed by letters (3.80%) and reviews (3.4%). The annual number of research publications increased from 30 in 1980 to 111 in 2015, indicating that the number of publications on toxocariasis has increased slowly over the past 35 years. The United States of America and Japan are the predominant countries of origin, with 303 articles and 207 articles, respectively, followed by Brazil and the United Kingdom, with 180 (6.5%) each. The h-index for all the publications was 60. The highest h-index were for publications from the United Kingdom (h-index value = 43) and the United States (h-index value = 39); these two countries were also involved with the highest number of international collaborations, with 27 and 28 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Developed countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, are the world\u2019s leaders in toxocariasis research, contributing to more than 34% of the total published literature. In addition, developing countries, such as Brazil, Poland, Argentina and India, showed a noticeable increase in published papers on toxocariasis research in recent years. A push for more collaboration is needed to achieve a superior research strategy related to toxocariasis at the global level from the viewpoint of epidemiological data, clinical aspects, medical ecology, molecular aspects and treatment practices associated with toxocariasis.","publish_time":"2017-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"Health Res Policy Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9809fd94325b39bffb3a2414a3d7f3e1429fa539.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5324285.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-017-0178-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","United States of America","Brazil","Japan","France","Germany","Poland","Argentina","India"],"keyphrases":["global toxocariasis research","characteristics of toxocariasis research","number of publications","United Kingdom","annual number of research publications","United States of America","h-index value","highest h-index","Developed countries","Articles","superior research strategy","predominant countries of origin","Japan","published papers","Brazil","total published literature","highest number of international collaborations","clinical aspects","molecular aspects","global level","bibliometric analysis","recent years","document types","popular document form","title keyword search","medical ecology","viewpoint of epidemiological data","noticeable increase","treatment practices","prevalent parasitic disease","tropical regions","India","Italy","Germany","France","study","world\u2019s leaders","Argentina","Poland","accounting","impact","language restriction","trends","public health","CONCLUSIONS","letters","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","Searches","Scopus database","push","reviews","addition","Terms"],"language":"en"},

Otters are widely spread through Portugal, and scats have been extensively used in ecology studies; however, valid information on their microbiota is scarce. This work represents a first approach to characterise the otter faecal microflora in samples collected in river stretches of the Sado river basin (Portugal) during winter 2006. Eight sampling stretches of 8 km were selected, and from each, six to eight sampling sites were visited. A total of 31 scats were analysed. The microflora studied included aerobic bacteria, spore-forming anaerobic bacteria and viruses (coronavirus, parvovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus). Bacterial isolates were identified based on morphology and metabolic pathways, and virus detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed the high degree of bacterial diversity in the faecal microflora of L. lutra. A total of 88 Gram-negative (23 genera) and 44 Gram-positive isolates (ten genera) were identified. The identification of four isolates was inconclusive, and their identification was performed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing, which confirms the need for biochemical testing optimisation regarding animal isolates. None of the scats was positive for virus detection. Identification of otter faecal microflora and of potential pathogens is an important first step towards understanding and monitoring their importance in otter population health.","publish_time":"2007-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveira, M.; Sales-Lu\u00EDs, T.; Duarte, A.; Nunes, S.

The present World Health Organization (WHO) estimate is that nearly 2billion subjects living in the developing world may have zinc deficiency. This is mainly because they subsist on cereal proteins which contain high quantities of organic phosphate compounds, which combine with zinc making it unavailable for absorption. The major adverse clinical effects of zinc deficiency are growth retardation, decreased cell-mediated immunity, impairment of cognitive functions, increased oxidative stress, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Our studies have shown that nearly 30% of healthy, well-to-do elderly subjects living in developed countries may also be zinc deficient due to an increased phytate to zinc molar ratio in their diet. Over 300 enzymes and 2000 transcription factors are now known to require zinc for their functions and stability of their structures, and several studies have now shown that zinc may be a molecular signal for neuronal and immune cells. Fourteen ZIP and 10 ZNT zinc transporters are known to maintain intracellular zinc homeostasis. Therapeutic impacts of zinc on human health are also being investigated. Zinc is being used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in infants and children in developing countries globally, and this has resulted in saving millions of lives. Zinc is now an approved drug for the treatment and maintenance therapy of Wilson\u0027s disease, a serious fatal genetic disorder. According to a recent Cochrane Review, zinc is the only treatment which is effective in decreasing the incidence of infections and pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc acetate lozenges have been shown to decrease the duration of the common cold by 50%, provided the treatment is started within 24h of the onset of symptoms, the solution chemistry of the zinc preparation is proper, and the zinc dosages are adequate. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for a large proportion of legal blindness in elderly subjects throughout the world. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group (AREDS) was supported by National Eye Institute. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now reported the results of their 10-year zinc supplementation study in patients with AMD. Zinc was effective in decreasing the incidences of blindness and progression of AMD in elderly subjects. Most importantly, zinc-supplemented subjects showed increased longevity and this was due to a decrease in cardiovascular events. No other micronutrient has shown this dramatic effect on decreasing mortality in the elderly. Our placebo-controlled, zinc supplementation trial in the elderly has shown that zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of infections by 66% and improved cell-mediated immunity. Also, we showed that oxidative stress markers and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines were decreased in elderly subjects who received zinc supplementation. These studies suggest that zinc supplementation in the elderly may have a preventive role in atherosclerosis. Plasma zinc is widely used as a biomarker of zinc deficiency in humans. This test is, however, neither specific nor sensitive. Assays of immunological markers such as plasma active thymulin and gene expression of IL-2 in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes are very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of human zinc deficiency. The assay of zinc in cells such as lymphocytes and granulocytes are better than plasma zinc; however, even these assays are less sensitive than immunological biomarkers.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prasad, Ananda S.","journal":"Molecular, Genetic, and Nutritional Aspects of Major and Trace Minerals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3041548a2d6346840a87b7b9489e4c9faa9305a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149581.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021682000208; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128021682000208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US National Academy of Sciences","World Health Organization","Eye Disease Study Group","National Eye Institute","NIH","AMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Plasma zinc","zinc preparation","zinc dosages","assay of zinc","zinc-supplemented subjects","biomarker of zinc deficiency","Abstract Zinc deficiency","zinc supplementation trial","ZNT zinc transporters","Therapeutic impacts of zinc","intracellular zinc homeostasis","Zinc acetate lozenges","diagnosis of human zinc deficiency","year zinc supplementation study","major adverse clinical effects of zinc deficiency","well-to-do elderly subjects","studies","decreased cell-mediated immunity","human health","developing world","sickle cell disease","National Institutes of Health","patients","gene expression of inflammatory cytokines","oxidative stress markers","improved cell-mediated immunity","progression of AMD","Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group","Assays of immunological markers","incidence of infections","developing countries","treatment of acute diarrhea","present World Health Organization","humans","National Eye Institute","increased phytate","increased longevity","decreasing mortality","gene expression of IL","plasma active thymulin","upregulation of inflammatory cytokines","maintenance therapy of Wilson\u0027s disease","incidences of blindness","developed countries","immune cells","immunological biomarkers","US National Academy of Sciences","impairment of cognitive functions","PHA-stimulated lymphocytes","Age-related macular degeneration","large proportion of legal blindness","growth retardation","accounts","AREDS","pain crises","infants","solution chemistry","high quantities of organic phosphate compounds","serious fatal genetic disorder","children","molecular signal","granulocytes","dramatic effect","approved drug","onset of symptoms","molar ratio","recommended dietary allowance","NIH","estimate","cereal proteins","recent Cochrane Review","preventive role","structures","ZIP","results","stability","placebo","transcription factors","duration","enzymes","atherosclerosis","micronutrient","cardiovascular events","time","absorption","millions of lives","test"],"language":"en"},

Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic. The objective of our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies implemented in Egypt. In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt. Then, we assessed the risk of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using a multi-criteria evaluation approach. Finally, we combined the animal trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely. Our results indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then, they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing) seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction, and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed.","publish_time":"2018-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napp, Sebastian; Chevalier, Veronique; Busquets, N\u00FAria; Calistri, Paolo; Casal, Jordi; Attia, Mohamed; Elbassal, Rehab; Hosni, Heba; Farrag, Hatem; Hassan, Noura; Tawfik, Rasha; Abd Elkader, Sohair; Bayomy, Shahin","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b470094ead1416c283ca042644ac1061103b101.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5792020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351273/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley Fever","RVFV"],"locations":["Sudan"],"keyphrases":["introduction of RVFV","risk of RVFV transmission data","main risk of RVFV introduction","risk of Rift Valley Fever virus","Egypt","importation of animals","vectors","populated areas","surveillance strategies","quarantines","animal trade","legal trade of live animals","control strategies","RVF epidemics","animal markets","continuous flow of large number of camels","livestock sector","country","improvement","serious public health implications","sub-Saharan countries","multi-criteria evaluation approach","significant losses","slaughterhouses","periods","humans","zoonosis","disease","vaccination","testing","study","Sudan","mosquito","limited effect","objective","measures","Nile river","results","year","order"],"language":"en"},

Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population.

The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 37.0% in group A, 35.2% in group B and 19.2% in group C (P\u003C0.05). Among the different healthcare categories, nurses had a significant higher prevalence of H. pylori infection (P\u003C0.01).

Therapeutic glycyrrhizin concentrations substantially inhibited H5N1-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules CXCL10, interleukin 6, CCL2, and CCL5 (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 25 to 50 \u00B5g/ml) but interfered with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced apoptosis to a lesser extent (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 100 \u00B5g/ml or higher). Glycyrrhizin also diminished monocyte migration towards supernatants of H5N1-infected A549 cells. The mechanism by which glycyrrhizin interferes with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression includes inhibition of H5N1-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and (in turn) reduced activation of NF\u03BAB, JNK, and p38, redox-sensitive signalling events known to be relevant for influenza A virus replication.

In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? METHOD: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and \u201Cextreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs\u201D, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are \u201Cincredibly vulnerable to this virus\u201D. CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs.

The CFD model employed in this study has been validated against previous experimental data. The results show that the presence of an upstream building greatly changes the path lines around the downstream target building and the pollutant transportation routes around it. The presence of a low upstream building also greatly increases the average air exchange rate (ACH) values and the pollutant re-entry ratios (R k ) below the source unit on the windward side of the downstream target building for normal wind incidence. However, the presence of a high upstream building greatly increases the average ACH values on the windward side and increases the R k on the leeward side of the downstream building for oblique wind incidence.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, D.

We present here data showing that rRNA degradation is followed by apoptosis accompanied by characteristic DNA laddering in the cytoplasm of 18f infected cells. The DNA laddering coincided with the detection of caspase 3 and PARP-1 cleavage and was dependent upon activation of the caspase pathway, since treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, inhibited both events. RNase L mRNA was present in both virus-infected and uninfected cells. Messenger RNA for the interferon inducible enzyme 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2032\u20135\u2032 OAS), which polymerizes ATP into 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligo adenylate (2\u20135A, the activator of RNase L) in the presence of double-stranded RNA, was not detected following virus infection. 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 OAS mRNA was induced by treatment of the cells with interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2). IFN-\u03B2 mRNA was marginally induced following infection. However, phosphorylated STAT 1, a key regulator of interferon-stimulated gene transcription was not detected in virus infected cells. STAT 1 phosphorylation in response to IFN treatment was lower in virus-infected cells, compared to uninfected cells treated with interferon, suggesting that 18f virus infection interferes with interferon signaling.

However, due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients, invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit (ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. METHODS: We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia between January 1(st) 2008 and December 31(st) 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, microbiological findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU, 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter, with a community onset, in patients with history of recent chemotherapy, and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen detected, while influenza A was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory virus detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia is not rare, and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful, and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management.","publish_time":"2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyung-Jun; Choi, Sun Mi; Lee, Jinwoo; Park, Young Sik; Lee, Chang-Hoon; Yim, Jae-Joon; Yoo, Chul-Gyu; Kim, Young Whan; Han, Sung Koo; Lee, Sang-Min","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fd909b06fcb46cf45b5d099741e4a86138ac6f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6005478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912989/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198902","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory virus detection","ill patients","Severe viral pneumonia","detection rate","clinical impact of virus detection","detection of viral pathogens","yield of viral detection","common virus","respiratory viruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","certain group of patients","RT-PCR","clinical management","origin of severe pneumonia","clinical outcomes","common pathogen","positive results","upper respiratory specimen","Invasive sampling","positive changes","laboratory results","invasive diagnostic methods","medical ICU","Additional bronchoscopic sampling","high mortality rate","microbiological findings","history of recent chemotherapy","Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","risk factors","caution","winter","analysis","baseline characteristics","low platelet count","intensive care unit","community onset","prevalence","influenza","bacterial coinfection","vulnerability","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Gathering sequence information on ruminant AstVs is important to understand the extent of inter-species circulation and for the development of reliable, specific diagnostic tools.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martella, Vito; Catella, Cristiana; Capozza, Paolo; Diakoudi, Georgia; Camero, Michele; Lanave, Gianvito; Galante, Domenico; Cafiero, Maria Assunta; Lavazza, Antonio; B\u00E1nyai, Kriszti\u00E1n; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Res Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc55dddbc03e3407909050e21acf7fc3efee67f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195147.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528819313001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304933/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528819313001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["buffalo AstVs","buffalo calves","AstV RNA","water buffalo AstV strains","young bovine","characterization of bovine","enteritis","stools of calves","ruminant AstVs","sequence information","TEM","full-length ORF2","development of reliable","partial ORF1b","observation","negative staining transmission electron microscopy","marked genetic diversity","encephalitis","extent of inter-species circulation","brain tissues of bovines","phylogenetic analysis","specific diagnostic tools","detection","pathogenic role","animals","particles","Italy","genome","end","study","Astroviruses","ruminants"],"language":"en"},

A clear example of this step-change is represented by the amount of DNA sequence data that can be now produced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Similarly, recent improvements in protein and peptide separation efficiencies and highly accurate mass spectrometry have promoted the identification and quantification of proteins in a given sample. These advancements in biotechnology have increasingly been applied to the study of animal infectious diseases and are beginning to revolutionize the way that biological and evolutionary processes can be studied at the molecular level. Studies have demonstrated the value of NGS technologies for molecular characterization, ranging from metagenomic characterization of unknown pathogens or microbial communities to molecular epidemiology and evolution of viral quasispecies. Moreover, high-throughput technologies now allow detailed studies of host-pathogen interactions at the level of their genomes (genomics), transcriptomes (transcriptomics), or proteomes (proteomics). Ultimately, the interaction between pathogen and host biological networks can be questioned by analytically integrating these levels (integrative OMICS and systems biology). The application of high-throughput biotechnology platforms in these fields and their typical low-cost per information content has revolutionized the resolution with which these processes can now be studied. The aim of this chapter is to provide a current and prospective view on the opportunities and challenges associated with the application of massive parallel sequencing technologies to veterinary medicine, with particular focus on applications that have a potential impact on disease control and management.","publish_time":"2014-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Borm, Steven; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Freimanis, Graham; Fusaro, Alice; Granberg, Fredrik; H\u00F6per, Dirk; King, Donald P.; Monne, Isabella; Orton, Richard; Rosseel, Toon","journal":"Veterinary Infection Biology: Molecular Diagnostics and High-Throughput Strategies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f4eea79924fb1aacc3bc3cb22b75064a0cf693d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25399113/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2004-4_30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["throughput molecular technologies","high-throughput technologies","molecular characterization","molecular level","molecular epidemiology","application of high","value of NGS technologies","throughput biotechnology platforms","application of massive parallel sequencing technologies","development of high","detailed studies of host","host biological networks","pathogen interactions","generation sequencing","associated bioinformatics","proteomic data","evolutionary processes","DNA sequence data","metagenomic characterization of unknown pathogens","veterinary medicine","microbial communities","peptide separation efficiencies","accurate mass spectrometry","fields","potential impact","identification","applications","opportunities","particular focus","challenges","evolution of viral quasispecies","quantification of proteins","information content","recent improvements","large amounts of genomic","transcriptomics","handle","transcriptomes","levels","integrative OMICS","systems biology","prospective view","disease control","management","genomics","genomes","clear example","step-change","study of animal infectious diseases","proteomes","given sample","capacities of scientists","resolution","way","chapter","proteomics","aim","advancements"],"language":"en"},

H. somni is a member of the bovine respiratory disease complex that causes severe bronchopneumonia in cattle. Previously, it has been reported that bovine neutrophils and macrophages have limited ability to phagocytose and kill H. somni. Recently, it was discovered that bovine neutrophils and macrophages produce extracellular traps in response to Mannheimia haemolytica, another member of the bovine respiratory disease complex. In this study, we demonstrate that H. somni also causes extracellular trap production by bovine neutrophils in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which did not coincide with the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for necrosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps were produced in response to outer membrane vesicles, but not lipooligosacchride alone. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, we observed H. somni cells trapped within a web-like structure. Further analyses demonstrated that bovine neutrophils trapped and killed H. somni in a DNA-dependent manner. Treatment of DNA extracellular traps with DNase I freed H. somni cells and diminished bacterial death. Treatment of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages with H. somni cells also caused macrophage extracellular trap formation. These findings suggest that extracellular traps may play a role in the host response to H. somni infection in cattle.","publish_time":"2012-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hellenbrand, Katrina M.; Forsythe, Katelyn M.; Rivera-Rivas, Jose J.; Czuprynski, Charles J.; Aulik, Nicole A.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c4033fa0e4e46bd1822ea61fdd5964c1355a499.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125803.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022668/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401012001672; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2012.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401012001672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Histophilus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["somni cells","bovine neutrophils","somni infection","Histophilus somni","Neutrophil extracellular traps","bovine respiratory disease complex","Treatment of DNA extracellular traps","extracellular trap production","cattle","Treatment of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages","macrophage extracellular trap formation","member","host response","DNA-dependent manner","time-dependent manner","confocal microscopy","scanning electron microscopy","dose","DNase","Haemophilus somnus","Gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacillus","severe bronchopneumonia","Mannheimia haemolytica","neuronal diseases","outer membrane vesicles","marker","diminished bacterial death","role","release of lactate dehydrogenase","ability","necrosis","lipooligosacchride","web","findings","analyses","structure","study"],"language":"en"},

About 30\u201350% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin with influenza A infection a key cause of explosive community outbreaks. Many different influenza A viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics. Since 2009, when pandemic (H1N1) influenza A emerged from a swine origin, there have been a number of different zoonotic influenza A transmissions into the human population, including H1N1 and H3N2 variant viruses in North America and H7N9 viruses in China. The segmented nature of the influenza A virus genome and the circulation of these viruses in wild bird, domestic poultry and mammalian reservoirs presents a continuous opportunity for reassortment of viral genes and the emergence of a novel pandemic virus. Constant vigilance is required. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012, highlights the fact that other serious respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals. Enhanced awareness of the potential for serious human respiratory disease in association with travel, or animal exposure, should form part of clinical assessment. Rapid developments in genomic technology improve the ability to diagnose previously undetected pathogens. Preventative measures for influenza include annual vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Recently, contaminated feed was confirmed as a vehicle for PEDV infection of na\u00EFve piglets. This research provides in vivo data supporting the ability of a liquid antimicrobial product to reduce this risk. RESULTS: Sal CURB\u00AE (Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA, USA) is a FDA-approved liquid antimicrobial used to control Salmonella contamination in poultry and swine diets. To test its effect against PEDV, Sal CURB\u00AE-treated feed was spiked with a stock isolate of PEDV (Ct = 25.22), which PEDV-na\u00EFve piglets were allowed to ingest via natural feeding behavior (ad libitum) for a 14-day period. For the purpose of a positive control, a separate group of piglets was allowed to ingest non-treated (Sal CURB\u00AE-free) feed also spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 25.22). A negative control group received PEDV-free feed. Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding in feces were observed in the positive control group 2\u20133 days post-consumption of non-treated feed. In contrast, no evidence of infection was observed in pigs fed Sal CURB\u00AE-treated feed or in the negative controls throughout the 14-day study period. In addition, the Sal CURB\u00AE-treated feed samples had higher (p \u003C 0.0001) mean PEDV Ct values than samples from the positive control group. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide proof of concept that feed treated with Sal CURB\u00AE can serve as a means to reduce the risk of PEDV infection through contaminated feed. Furthermore, the results from the positive control group provide additional proof of concept regarding the ability of contaminated feed to serve as a risk factor for PEDV infection of na\u00EFve piglets.","publish_time":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dee, Scott; Neill, Casey; Clement, Travis; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db97b6fadbd7b65de3e513beec8f3eca89bac377.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4179854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253192/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0220-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sal"],"organizations":["PEDV","Kemin Industries, Des Moines"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-free feed","stock PEDV","risk of PEDV infection","treated feed samples","Sal CURB","PEDV-na\u00EFve piglets","PEDV infection of na\u00EFve piglets","positive control group","ability of contaminated feed","PEDV Ct values","stock isolate of PEDV","Clinical signs of PEDV infection","negative control group","days post-consumption of non-treated feed","separate group of piglets","evidence of infection","risk factor","data","RESULTS","day period","additional proof of concept","liquid antimicrobial product","day study period","FDA-approved liquid antimicrobial","negative controls","swine diets","US swine industry","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","vomiting","Salmonella contamination","vehicle","Kemin Industries","feces","pigs","ad libitum","natural feeding behavior","USA","Moines","poultry","viral shedding","initial detection","means","effect","BACKGROUND","research","CONCLUSIONS","contrast","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Injection of chicken embryo with the GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially reduces viral replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Injection of shRNA-1370 into chicken embryo also reduces the replication of avian influenza virus (AIV). In contrast, GLTSCR2-derived protein G4-T, forming \u03B1-helical dimers, increases replication of seven various DNA and RNA viruses in cells.

Countries have set an ambitious health policy agenda for the next 15 years with prioritisation of universal health coverage under the Sustainable Development Goals. The scale of investment needed for equitable access to health services means global health is one of the key economic opportunities for decades to come. New financing partnerships with the private sector are vital. The aim of this study is to unlock additional financing sources, acknowledging the imperative to link financial returns to the providers of capital, and create profitable, sustainable financing structures. This paper outlines the global health investment opportunity exploring intersections of financial and health sector interests, and the role investment in health can play in economic development. Considering increasing demand for impact investments, the paper explores responsible financing initiatives and expansion of the global movement for sustainable capital markets. Adding an explicit health component (H) to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment criteria, creating the ESG\u002BH initiative, could serve as catalyst for the inclusion of health criteria into mainstream financial actors\u2019 business practices and investment objectives. The conclusion finds that health considerations directly impact profitability of the firm and therefore should be incorporated into financial analysis. Positive assessment of health impact, at a broad societal or environmental level, as well as for a firm\u2019s employees can become a value enhancing competitive advantage. An ESG\u002BH framework could incorporate this into mainstream financial decision-making and into scalable investment products.","publish_time":"2018-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krech, R\u00FCdiger; Kickbusch, Ilona; Franz, Christian; Wells, Nadya","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23cc9704b77903e3ec5e9ecb81ebf83b3a231c4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5935160.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29736278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESG H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health services","health considerations","global health investment opportunity","global health burden","inclusion of health criteria","health sector interests","multiple health financing challenges","explicit health component","Positive assessment of health impact","investment criteria","prioritisation of universal health coverage","ambitious health policy agenda","investment objectives","role investment","scale of investment","intersections of financial","financial returns","financial analysis","sustainable financing structures","ESG","scalable investment products","global movement","responsible financing initiatives","New financing partnerships","additional financing sources","mainstream financial actors\u2019 business practices","paper","sustainable capital markets","Sustainable Development Goals","impact investments","H framework","H initiative","economic development","private sector","providers of capital","environmental level","key economic opportunities","expansion","equitable access","years","imperative","catalyst","Governance","value","study","world","increasing demand","decades","profitability","Countries","firm\u2019s employees","competitive advantage","conclusion","aim"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 isoform 1 colocalizes with HA and cleaves and activates HA. Finally, we show that isoform 1 activates the SARS-CoV spike protein for cathepsin L-independent entry into target cells. Our results indicate that TMPRSS2 isoform 1 is expressed in viral target cells and might contribute to viral activation in the host.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zmora, Pawel; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f962ad62ba3d5af7c52898283c4827ff71a5949.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4574978.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26379044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tmprss2 mRNA","TMPRSS2 expression","TMPRSS2 isoforms","cellular protease TMPRSS2","viral activation","HA","viral target cells","viral spread","SARS-CoV spike protein","respiratory viruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cathepsin","extended N-terminal cytoplasmic domain","independent entry","influenza virus hemagglutinin","alternative splicing","lung-derived cell lines","tissues","pathogenesis","amino acids","previous studies","mice","colocalizes","host","results"],"language":"en"},

Ignoring these acute\u2010level infections may lead to complications. Particularly in Pakistan, respiratory infections account for 20% to 30% of all deaths of children. Even though these infections are common, insufficiency of accessible data hinders development of a comprehensive summary of the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence rate in various regions of Pakistan and also to recognize the existing viral strains responsible for viral respiratory infections through published data. Respiratory viruses are detected more frequently among rural dwellers in Pakistan. Lower tract infections are found to be more lethal. The associated pathogens comprise respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. RSV is more dominant and can be subtyped as RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B (BA\u20109, BA\u201010, and BA\u201013). Influenza A (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, and H1N1pdm09) and Influenza B are common among the Pakistani population. Generally, these strains are detected in a seasonal pattern with a high incidence during spring and winter time. The data presented include pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and influenza. This paper aims to emphasise the need for standard methods to record the incidence and etiology of associated pathogens in order to provide effective treatment against viral infections of the respiratory tract and to reduce death rates.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naz, Riffat; Gul, Asma; Javed, Urooj; Urooj, Alina; Amin, Sidra; Fatima, Zareen","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbfb3918ec54359f1290456e75319cdfe7da422a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169323.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral respiratory infections","viral infections","respiratory infections account","Respiratory viruses","lower respiratory tract","level infections","Lower tract infections","RSV","respiratory syncytial virus","Influenza B","BA","parainfluenza virus","published data","various regions of Pakistan","existing viral strains responsible","etiology of associated pathogens","insufficiency of accessible data","high incidence","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","deaths of children","morbidity of children greater","years","coronavirus","order","rhinovirus","adenovirus","effective treatment","foremost cause of mortality","spring","development","prevalence rate","HMPV","enterovirus","H1N1pdm09","comprehensive summary","seasonal pattern","developing countries","winter time","H5N1","H3N2","standard methods","Pakistani population","need","study","pneumonia","bronchiolitis","death rates","rural dwellers","problem","complications","paper","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. Methods This was a mixed-method observational study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. Findings The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (76.4%) but poor timeliness (41.5%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included lack of supervision, inadequate resources for training and difficulty to implement weekly report due to overwhelming paperwork at frontline health services. Conclusions The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Kagoli, Matthew; Kaasb\u00F8ll, Jens Johan; Bjune, Gunnar Aksel","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cbefcf4c0fbb8466db7d00b8f53e1f37a6bf8b5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7d37b9bb45aa60ff71b01a27afee24eca35597d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/363713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health Regulation","national District Health Information System","IDSR"],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["IDSR system implementation","national surveillance system","public health surveillance system","current IDSR system","timeliness of surveillance system performance","future disease surveillance system","national District Health Information System","challenges of IDSR implementation","IDSR technical guideline","state of IDSR implementation","Integrated Disease Surveillance","emerging mobile health","frontline health services","International Health Regulation","frontline health service providers","Qualitative data","selected district","Malawi","differences","outbreaks","better timeliness","national levels","weekly reports","poor timeliness","Quantitative data","Ebola Virus Disease","actual practice","developing information technology infrastructure","good completeness","early response","total expected monthly reports","mixed-method observational study","key informants","training","EVD","lack of supervision","resource-constrained countries","overwhelming paperwork","mHealth","interviews","administration","inadequate resources","strategy","globe","difficulty","bell","unusual events detection","IHR","requirements","Conclusions","DHIS2","efforts","opportunities","Objective","country","Findings"],"language":"en"},

They are produced by transfer of the glycan precursor to the sequon Asn-X-Thr/Ser, followed by enzymatic trimming to a high-mannose-type core and sequential addition of monosaccharides to generate complex-type and hybrid glycans. This process, mediated by the concerted action of multiple enzymes, produces a mixture of related glycoforms at each glycosite, making analysis of glycosylation difficult. To address this analytical challenge, we developed a robust semiquantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based method that determines the degree of glycan occupancy at each glycosite and the proportion of N-glycans processed from high-mannose type to complex type. It is applicable to virtually any glycoprotein, and a complete analysis can be conducted with 30 \u03BCg of protein. Here, we provide a detailed description of the method that includes procedures for (i) proteolytic digestion of glycoprotein(s) with specific and nonspecific proteases; (ii) denaturation of proteases by heating; (iii) sequential treatment of the glycopeptide mixture with two endoglycosidases, Endo H and PNGase F, to create unique mass signatures for the three glycosylation states; (iv) LC-MS/MS analysis; and (v) data analysis for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states. Full coverage of site-specific glycosylation of glycoproteins is achieved, with up to thousands of high-confidence spectra hits for each glycosite. The protocol can be performed by an experienced technician or student/postdoc with basic skills for proteomics experiments and takes \u223C7 d to complete.

Many of these changes are driven by viral manipulation of host transcription or translation machinery. Several mammalian viruses encode factors that broadly dampen gene expression by directly targeting messenger RNA (mRNA). Here, we highlight how these factors promote mRNA degradation to globally regulate both host and viral gene expression. Although these viral factors are not homologous and use distinct mechanisms to target mRNA, many of them display striking parallels in their strategies for executing RNA degradation and invoke key features of cellular RNA quality control pathways. In some cases, there is a lack of selectivity for degradation of host versus viral mRNA, indicating that the purposes of virus-induced mRNA degradation extend beyond redirecting cellular resources towards viral gene expression. In addition, several antiviral pathways use RNA degradation as a viral restriction mechanism, and we will summarize new findings related to how these host-encoded ribonucleases target and destroy viral RNA.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abernathy, Emma; Glaunsinger, Britt","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0b09afb591c7f9abd261928afa3902a6a57f560.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4424162.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215000501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721579/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215000501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","viral mRNA","viral factors","viral gene expression","degradation of host","induced mRNA degradation","viral manipulation of host transcription","viral restriction mechanism","Abstract Viral replication","messenger RNA","gene expression landscape of infected cells","host-encoded ribonucleases target","key features of cellular RNA quality control pathways","cellular resources","antiviral pathways","purposes of virus","translation machinery","strategies","lack of selectivity","distinct mechanisms","striking parallels","addition","new findings","mammalian viruses","changes","cases"],"language":"en"},

The mechanisms of HSV-1 infection and HSV-1\u2019s interactions with various host cells have been studied and reviewed extensively. Type I interferons were secreted by host cells upon HSV infection and play a vital role in controlling virus proliferation. A few studies, however, have focused on HSV-1 infection without the presence of interferon (IFN) signaling. In this study, HEK 293T cells with low toll-like receptor (TLR) and stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) expression were infected with HSV-1 and subjected to a quantitative proteomic analysis. By using a subcellular fractionation strategy and high-performance mass spectrometry, a total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated. A bioinformatics analysis indicated that multiple signaling pathways might be involved in HSV-1 infection. A further functional study indicated the role of Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 2 (CHCHD2), and Tripartite motif-containing protein 27 (TRIM27) in inhibiting viral DNA replication and proliferation.

Yet, preparedness and operational capabilities in this sector remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was twofold; first, to identify appropriate measures of preparedness, and second, to assess preparedness levels and factors significantly associated with preparedness. METHODS: Three separate checklists were developed to measure different aspects of preparedness: MFI Plan Elements, Operational Capabilities, and Pre-existing Resource Networks. Using a cross-sectional study design, data on these and other variables of interest were collected in 2014 from a national convenience sample of ME/C using an internet-based, anonymous survey. Preparedness levels were determined and compared across Federal Regions and in relation to the number of Presidential Disaster Declarations, also by Federal Region. Bivariate logistic and multivariable models estimated the associations between organizational characteristics and relative preparedness. RESULTS: A large proportion (42%) of respondents reported that less than 25 additional fatalities over a 48-hour period would exceed their response capacities. The preparedness constructs measured three related, yet distinct, aspects of preparedness, with scores highly variable and generally suboptimal. Median scores for the three preparedness measures also varied across Federal Regions and as compared to the number of Presidential Declared Disasters, also by Federal Region. Capacity was especially limited for activating missing persons call centers, launching public communications, especially via social media, and identifying temporary interment sites. The provision of staff training was the only factor studied that was significantly (positively) associated (p \u003C .05) with all three preparedness measures. Although ME/Cs ranked local partners, such as Offices of Emergency Management, first responders, and funeral homes, as the most important sources of assistance, a sizeable proportion (72%) expected federal assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The three measures of MFI preparedness allowed for a broad and comprehensive assessment of preparedness. In the future, these measures can serve as useful benchmarks or criteria for assessing ME/Cs preparedness. The study findings suggest multiple opportunities for improvement, including the development and implementation of national strategies to ensure uniform standards for MFI management across all jurisdictions.

By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination. At 3\u20138 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting. Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem. The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis. MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis. These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease. This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination.","publish_time":"1987-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, S.; Schelper, R.; Bolger, E.; Ries, D.","journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8afb280788ce0249c4be87370c9eac09a3d25f57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0882401087900209; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0882401087900209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody-protected mice","MHV-JHM","susceptible mice","infected suckling mice","clinical disease","clinical encephalomyelitis","fatal disease","development of MHV","JHM latency","strain JHM","hindlimb paralysis","subsequent development of virus","acute encephalomyelitis","neurological disease","subsequent virus-induced demyelination","demyelinating disease","histological evidence of encephalomyelitis","absence of maternal antibody","mouse hepatitis virus","clinical manifestations","maternal immune factors","Evidence of inflammation","weeks post-inoculation","presence of maternal antibodies","suckling C57BL","signs of inflammation","early times","histological examination","host factors important","latent state","spinal cord","establishment","coronavirus","brainstem","results","months","animals","days","Viral antigen","model"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the physical fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among SARS survivors. Design A cohort study. Setting An outpatient physiotherapy department in a major hospital in Hong Kong. Participants SARS patients (N=171) discharged from the hospital. Their mean age was 37.36\u00B112.65 years, and the average number of days of hospitalization was 21.79\u00B19.93 days. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Subjects\u2019 cardiorespiratory (6-minute walk test [6MWT], Chester step test for predicting maximal oxygen uptake [V\u0307o2max]), musculoskeletal (proximal/distal muscle strength and endurance test), and HRQOL status (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) were measured and compared with the normative data matched for age and sex.

Although the emergence of infectious diseases and their subsequent spread have a significant impact on global health and economics, a comprehensive literature evaluation of this topic has yet to be carried out. Thus, the current study encompasses the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature evaluation and classification of the fuzzy logic methods in infectious diseases. 40 papers on this topic, which have been published from 2005 to 2019 and related to the human infectious diseases were evaluated and analyzed. The findings of this evaluation clearly show that the fuzzy logic methods are vastly used for diagnosis of diseases such as dengue fever, hepatitis and tuberculosis. The key fuzzy logic methods used for the infectious disease are the fuzzy inference system; the rule-based fuzzy logic, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and fuzzy cognitive map. Furthermore, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were universally applied for a performance evaluation of the fuzzy logic techniques. This thesis will also address the various needs between the different industries, practitioners and researchers to encourage more research regarding the more overlooked areas, and it will conclude with several suggestions for the future infectious disease researches.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arji, Goli; Ahmadi, Hossein; Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh; A.

In March, the French medical authorities organized a medical surveillance of the medical staff who had returned from the French hospital in Hanoi. Each person presenting or not with respiratory symptoms was sampled systematically by the nearest general practitioner (GP) belonging to the influenza network surveillance in the community called GROG and the samples were sent to the NICs located either in Paris or in Lyon. We also received samples from patients hospitalized in the south of France suffering from acute respiratory infection soon after a journey in Asia. We implemented a PCR diagnosis for the human respiratory viruses: influenza A and B, Parainfluenza (Type 1 to Type 4), Metapneumovirus, RSV, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Adenovirus. In April, we set up the PCR detection of the SARS-associated coronavirus Urbani strain. The practitioners performed respiratory samples. From 14 March to 15 May we received and tested 88 respiratory samples, respectively, 19 were realized by GPs from the community network and 69 came from hospitalized patients. We never detected the urbani coronavirus strain. However, we detected respiratory viruses in 24% of the cases: the most frequent virus was influenza A H3N2 (11%) and Parainfluenza type 3 (8%). RSV, influenza A H1N1 and Rhinovirus were also detected 2, 1 and 1 cases, respectively. All the positive samples except the rhinovirus came from hospitalized patients. The patients were sampled once and all of them recovered rapidly.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valette, Martine; Lina, Bruno","journal":"International Congress Series","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8320b73d383b7b40d90992351834ac5b6df58fdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125625.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531513104003115; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ics.2004.02.161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288141/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0531513104003115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","Hanoi","Paris","Lyon","Asia"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","respiratory symptoms","hospitalized patients","acute respiratory infection","human respiratory viruses","Rhinovirus","positive samples","influenza network surveillance","medical surveillance","Parainfluenza type","virological diagnosis of suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome","PCR diagnosis","medical staff","community network","French medical authorities","RSV","urbani coronavirus strain","Lyon","cases","SARS-associated coronavirus Urbani strain","PCR detection","French hospital","south of France suffering","Enterovirus","frequent virus","H3N2","journey","GROG","nearest general practitioner","Metapneumovirus","Adenovirus","H1N1","Asia","Paris","Hanoi","GPs","NICs","person","practitioners"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (me/me) display a profound susceptibility to inflammatory CNS demyelination relative to wild type mice. In particular, SHP-1 deficiency may act predominantly in inflammatory macrophages to increase CNS demyelination as SHP-1-deficient macrophages display co-expression of inflammatory effector molecules and increased demyelinating activity in me/me mice. Recently, we reported that PBMCs of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a deficiency in SHP-1 expression relative to normal control subjects indicating that SHP-1 deficiency may play a similar role in MS as to that seen in mice. Therefore, it became essential to examine the specific expression and function of SHP-1 in macrophages from MS patients. Herein, we document that macrophages of MS patients have deficient SHP-1 protein and mRNA expression relative to those of normal control subjects. To examine functional consequences of the lower SHP-1, the activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03BAB was quantified and macrophages of MS patients showed increased activation of these transcription factors. In accordance with this observation, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-\u03BAB-responsive genes that mediate inflammatory demyelination were increased in macrophages of MS patients following cytokine and TLR agonist stimulation. Supporting a direct role of SHP-1 deficiency in altered macrophage function, experimental depletion of SHP-1 in normal subject macrophages resulted in an increased STAT/NF-\u03BAB activation and increased inflammatory gene expression to levels seen in macrophages of MS patients. In conclusion, macrophages of MS patients display a deficiency of SHP-1 expression, heightened activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03BAB and a corresponding inflammatory profile that may be important in controlling macrophage-mediated demyelination in MS.","publish_time":"2009-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christophi, George P.; Panos, Michael; Hudson, Chad A.; Christophi, Rebecca L.; Gruber, Ross C.; Mersich, Akos T.; Blystone, Scott D.; Jubelt, Burk; Massa, Paul T.","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1e47847b222b58ed3c6cc35c785b1136c388019.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2725397.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2009.32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19398961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory macrophages","deficiency of SHP","macrophages of MS patients","deficient SHP","function of SHP","lower SHP","lacking SHP","inflammatory demyelination","increased inflammatory gene expression","deficient macrophages","direct role of SHP","experimental depletion of SHP","increased activation","normal subject macrophages","inflammatory CNS demyelination relative","NF-\u03BAB activation","specific expression","protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP","mRNA expression relative","co-expression of inflammatory effector molecules","corresponding inflammatory profile","increased STAT","STAT1","heightened activation of STAT6","crucial negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine","increased demyelinating activity","macrophage-mediated demyelination","normal control subjects","wild type mice","altered macrophage function","similar role","TLR agonist stimulation","levels","profound susceptibility","responsive genes","PBMCs of multiple sclerosis","transcription factors","functional consequences","observation","conclusion","accordance","Recent studies"],"language":"en"},

ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H2O2 (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. Methods ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. Results At 20\u00B0C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD50 (lethal dose 50%) was \u003E5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals.

However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined. Objective We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. Methods We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal aspirate biomarkers, and viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. Results Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were virus-positive. Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds (symptom score \u22655) showed reduced forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25%-75%), higher nasal messenger RNA expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and higher protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10 and C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL)-2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Children with mild (symptom score, 1-4) and asymptomatic infections showed normal airway function and fewer biomarker elevations. Virus-negative cold-like illnesses demonstrated increased FeNO, minimal biomarker elevation, and normal airflow. The RV copy number was associated with nasal chemokine levels but not symptom score. Conclusion Urban children with asthma with high-symptom respiratory viral infections have reduced FEF25%-75% and more elevations of nasal biomarkers than children with mild or symptomatic infections, or virus-negative illnesses.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewis, Toby C.; Metitiri, Ediri E.; Mentz, Graciela B.; Ren, Xiaodan; Goldsmith, Adam M.; Eder, Breanna N.; Wicklund, Kyra E.; Walsh, Megan P.; Comstock, Adam T.; Ricci, Jeannette M.; Brennan, Sean R.; Washington, Ginger L.; Owens, Kendall B.; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Robins, Thomas G.; Batterman, Stuart A.; Hershenson, Marc B.","journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma \u0026 Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7671df838f978a12b1cf45e324085c22c3a98d0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6360098.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2018.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30385348/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120618313589; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120618313589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["C-X","C-C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Symptom score","high-symptom respiratory viral infections","virus-negative illnesses","high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections","virus-positive low-symptom illnesses","virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms","Conclusion Urban children","Virus-negative cold","self-reported respiratory illnesses","asymptomatic infections","Abstract Background Upper respiratory tract viral infections","virus-negative asymptomatic condition","greater respiratory tract inflammation","C-C motif chemokine ligands","nasal chemokine levels","elevations of nasal biomarkers","asthma exacerbations","nasal aspirate biomarkers","X-C motif chemokine ligand","higher nasal messenger RNA expression of C","viral nucleic acid","normal airway function","RV copy number","FEF25","fewer biomarker elevations","increased FeNO","higher protein abundance of CXCL8","severe colds","normal airflow","surveillance samples","melanoma differentiation-associated protein","reduced forced expiratory flow","minimal biomarker elevation","scheduled surveillance periods","impact of natural colds","high-risk urban environment","CXCL10","fraction of exhaled nitric oxide","spirometry","Michigan","rhinovirus","Detroit","year","community","CCL4","CCL20","CCL24","pulmonary volume","aspirates","Objective","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the study was to develop an oligonucleotide microarray for rapid diagnosis of avian diseases that would be used in the course of mass analysis for routine epidemiological surveillance owing to its ability to test one specimen for several infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: The paper describes the technique for rapid and simultaneous diagnosis of avian diseases such as avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and infectious bursal disease with use of oligonucleotide microarray, conditions for hybridization of fluorescent-labelled viral cDNA on the microarray and its specificity tested with use of AIV, NDV, IBV, IBDV strains as well as biomaterials from poultry. Sensitivity and specificity of the developed microarray was evaluated with use of 122 specimens of biological material: 44 cloacal swabs from sick birds and 78 tissue specimens from dead wild and domestic birds, as well as with use of 15 AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV strains, different in their origin, epidemiological and biological characteristics (RIBSP Microbial Collection). This microarray demonstrates high diagnostic sensitivity (99.16% within 95% CI limits 97.36\u2013100%) and specificity (100%). Specificity of the developed technique was confirmed by direct sequencing of NP and M (AIV), VP2 (IBDV), S1 (IBV), NP (NDV) gene fragments. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic effectiveness of the developed DNA microarray is 99.18% and therefore it can be used in mass survey for specific detection of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV circulating in the region in the course of epidemiological surveillance. Rather simple method for rapid diagnosis of avian viral diseases that several times shortens duration of assay versus classical diagnostic methods is proposed.","publish_time":"2017-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sultankulova, Kulyaisan T.; Kozhabergenov, Nurlan S.; Strochkov, Vitaliy M.; Burashev, Yerbol D.; Shorayeva, Kamshat A.; Chervyakova, Olga V.; Rametov, Nurkuisa M.; Sandybayev, Nurlan T.; Sansyzbay, Abylay R.; Orynbayev, Mukhit B.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13b8c068799a93b4441116bb6cabae222d126d32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382490.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0738-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","IBDV","NP","AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed microarray","IBV","NDV","use of oligonucleotide microarray","use of AIV","avian influenza virus","rapid diagnosis of avian diseases","developed DNA microarray","specificity","Newcastle disease virus","new oligonucleotide microarray","rapid diagnosis of avian viral diseases","infectious bursal disease virus","simultaneous diagnosis of avian diseases","IBDV strains","simultaneous rapid detection of avian viruses","developed technique","specific detection of AIV","infection bronchitis virus","mixed-virus infections","infectious bronchitis","course of epidemiological surveillance","routine epidemiological surveillance","Diagnostic effectiveness","classical diagnostic methods","high diagnostic sensitivity","specimens of biological material","course of mass analysis","tissue specimens","sick birds","biological characteristics","domestic birds","viral cDNA","mass survey","direct sequencing of NP","identical subarrays","cloacal swabs","duration of assay","times","origin","hybridization of fluorescent","conditions","region","RIBSP Microbial Collection","simple method","ability","paper","S1","RESULTS","gene fragments","biomaterials","CONCLUSION","study","VP2","poultry","BACKGROUND","CI limits","objective"],"language":"en"},

Potentially pathogenic organisms are present in the respiratory tract in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children, but their presence does not necessarily indicate disease. We aimed to assess the concordance between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota during LRTIs and the use of nasopharyngeal microbiota to discriminate LRTIs from health. METHODS: First, we did a prospective study of children aged between 4 weeks and 5 years who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Wilhelmina Children\u0027s Hospital (Utrecht, Netherlands) for a WHO-defined LRTI requiring mechanical ventilation. We obtained paired nasopharyngeal swabs and deep endotracheal aspirates from these participants (the so-called PICU cohort) between Sept 10, 2013, and Sept 4, 2016. We also did a matched case-control study (1:2) with the same inclusion criteria in children with LRTIs at three Dutch teaching hospitals and in age-matched, sex-matched, and time-matched healthy children recruited from the community. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at admission for cases and during home visits for controls. Data for child characteristics were obtained by questionnaires and from pharmacy printouts and medical charts. We used quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA-based sequencing to establish viral and bacterial microbiota profiles, respectively. We did sparse random forest classifier analyses on the bacterial data, viral data, metadata, and the combination of all three datasets to distinguish cases from controls. FINDINGS: 29 patients were enrolled in the PICU cohort. Intra-individual concordance in terms of viral microbiota profiles (96% agreement [95% CI 93\u201399]) and bacterial microbiota profiles (58 taxa with a median Pearson\u0027s r 0\u00B793 [IQR 0\u00B762\u20130\u00B799]; p\u003C0\u00B705 for all 58 taxa) was high between nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate samples, supporting the use of nasopharyngeal samples as proxy for lung microbiota during LRTIs. 154 cases and 307 matched controls were prospectively recruited to our case-control cohort. Individually, bacterial microbiota (area under the curve 0\u00B777), viral microbiota (0\u00B770), and child characteristics (0\u00B780) poorly distinguished health from disease. However, a classification model based on combined bacterial and viral microbiota plus child characteristics distinguished children with LRTIs from their matched controls with a high degree of accuracy (area under the curve 0\u00B792). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiota can serve as a valid proxy for lower respiratory tract microbiota in childhood LRTIs, that clinical LRTIs in children result from the interplay between microbiota and host characteristics, rather than a single microorganism, and that microbiota-based diagnostics could improve future diagnostic and treatment protocols.

Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) is an ideal model for studying the interaction between avian viruses and their hosts. To establish a methodological platform for RNAi studies in CEF, three plasmid vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted against the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) NP gene were constructed. One of them, ndv1, was proven effective on blocking viral replication in CEF and chicken embryos. Four hours prior to infection with NDV, the CEF was transfected with the plasmids by Silent-fect. An unrelated shRNA sequence (HK) was used in mock transfection. The expression of a potent shRNA resulted in up to 2.3, 21.1 and 9.8 fold decreases in NP gene expression at 3, 6 and 9 h post infection in CEF, respectively. The ndv1 was able to completely inhibit the replication of the virus in CEF within 48 post infection. Furthermore, the pathological changes in CEF caused by NDV were delayed, and the degree of pathological changes was lighter compared with the mock transfection in the presence of ndv1. When the complex of shRNA-Silent-fect and NDV was co-injected into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated eggs with 10(5) or 10(6) ELD(50) NDV, NDV replication was decreased by 94.14% and 62.15% after 17 h, respectively. These findings suggest that the newly synthesized NP protein is critical for NDV transcription and replication and provide a basis for identifying the functions of viral genes and screening for effective siRNAs against viruses in CEF and chicken embryo by RNAi.","publish_time":"2008-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yue, Hua; Li, Dingfei; Fu, Anjing; Ma, Li; Yang, Falong; Tang, Cheng","journal":"Front Biol China","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4ddfaa152b5c572f03b82ee772f0f220ac4f6e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11515-008-0080-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEF","Newcastle","NP","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEF","NDV replication","NDV transcription","viral replication","NP gene expression","gene functions","h post infection","RNAi studies","chicken embryos","Chicken embryo fibroblast","mock transfection","complex of shRNA","potent shRNA","presence of ndv1","synthesized NP protein","functions of viral genes","unrelated shRNA sequence","degree of pathological changes","effective siRNAs","avian viruses","Newcastle disease virus","plasmid vectors","shRNAs","allantoic cavity","screening","short hairpin RNAs","interaction","technology","HK","powerful tool","ideal model","basis","fold decreases","methodological platform","day-old embryonated eggs","hosts","RNA interference","findings","plasmids","hours","ELD"],"language":"en"},

In this study, antibacterial nanofilms with reactive oxygen species were generated by photocatalysis. To prepare these nanofilms, Ag and amorphous TiO(2) nanoparticles decorated on polydopamine (PDA) were coated on three-dimensional (3D) nanopore arrays, which was fabricated on a substrate of anodized stainless steel. All the antibacterial tests were conducted with a household flashlight, which may be considered as a practical approach for antibacterial materials. The photoelectrochemical property of the 3D Ag/TiO(2)/PDA nanofilm on 316L stainless steel (Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS) was about 15 times higher than that of the annealed Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS, and consequently, it exhibited higher antibacterial activity. The enhanced photoelectrochemical property is attributed to the successful separation of electrons (amorphous TiO(2)) and holes (Ag nanoparticles). Further, when a plate containing 3D Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS was irradiated with visible light just for 10 min, it immediately destroyed the bacteria in 10(6) CFU/mL without any bacterial colony. After five weeks, there were still no bacterial colonies in the plate corresponding to Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS under visible light, while Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS in dark had a negligible effect on the bacteria, i.e., the antibacterial mechanism through direct contact and ion dissolution was not efficient. The excellent antibacterial properties of 3D Ag/TiO(2)/PDA SS illuminated by flashlight provides an efficient, facile, and cost-effective technique for the development of antibacterial medical materials to meet the increasing demand of eliminating bacterial infections.

This review focuses on our current knowledge of filovirus egress and the viral and host factors and processes that are involved. Within the virus, these factors consist of the major matrix protein, viral protein 40 (VP40), which is necessary and sufficient for viral particle release, and nucleocapsid and glycoprotein that interact with VP40 to promote egress. In the host cell, some proteins are hijacked by filoviruses in order to enhance virion budding capacity that include members of the family of E3 ubiquitin ligase and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, while others such as tetherin inhibit viral egress. An understanding of these molecular interactions that modulate viral particle egress provides an important opportunity to identify new targets for the development of antivirals to prevent and treat filovirus infections.","publish_time":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Tamsin B.; Hayward, Joshua A.; Marsh, Glenn A.; Baker, Michelle L.; Tachedjian, Gilda","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609802/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral egress","viral protein","viral particle egress","new host","host cells","host factors","viral particle release","human host","deadliest viral pathogens","new cells","molecular interactions","new targets","current knowledge of filovirus egress","VP40","numerous complex molecular processes","filoviruses Ebolavirus","filovirus infections","major matrix protein","endosomal sorting complexes","members","family of E3 ubiquitin ligase","humans","important opportunity","transport","virion budding capacity","order","means","Marburgvirus","nucleocapsid","key feature","nascent virions","emerging diseases","ESCRT","development of antivirals","glycoprotein","proteins","fatality rates","pathway","tetherin","replication cycles","review","understanding","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to assess specific incidence and mortality trends of 45 notifiable infectious diseases from 2004 to 2013 in China and to investigate the overall effectiveness of current prevention and control strategies. METHODS: Incidence and mortality data for 45 notifiable infectious diseases were extracted from a WChinese public health science data centre from 2004 to 2013, which covers 31 provinces in mainland China. We estimated the annual percentage change in incidence of each infectious disease using joinpoint regression. FINDINGS: Between January, 2004, and December, 2013, 54 984 661 cases of 45 infectious diseases were reported (average yearly incidence 417\u00B798 per 100 000). The infectious diseases with the highest yearly incidence were hand, foot, and mouth disease (114\u00B748 per 100 000), hepatitis B (81\u00B757 per 100 000), and tuberculosis (80\u00B733 per 100 000). 132 681 deaths were reported among the 54 984 661 cases (average yearly mortality 1\u00B701 deaths per 100 000; average case fatality 2\u00B74 per 1000). Overall yearly incidence of infectious disease was higher among males than females and was highest among children younger than 10 years. Overall yearly mortality was higher among males than females older than 20 years and highest among individuals older than 80 years. Average yearly incidence rose from 300\u00B754 per 100 000 in 2004 to 483\u00B763 per 100 000 in 2013 (annual percentage change 5\u00B79%); hydatid disease (echinococcosis), hepatitis C, and syphilis showed the fastest growth. The overall increasing trend changed after 2009, and the annual percentage change in incidence of infectious disease in 2009\u201313 (2\u00B73%) was significantly lower than in 2004\u201308 (6\u00B72%). INTERPRETATION: Although the overall incidence of infectious diseases was increasing from 2004, the rate levelled off after 2009. Effective prevention and control strategies are needed for diseases with the highest incidence\u2014including hand, foot, and mouth disease, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis\u2014and those with the fastest rates of increase (including hydatid disease, hepatitis C, and syphilis).

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2032-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2032-part spanning 24,341\u201330,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2032-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus\u2013host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown. Methods We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student\u0027s t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA. Findings SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0\u00B752). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0\u00B70098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0\u00B7036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0\u00B7016; FRhK4, p=0\u00B70004). Interpretation As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

Calves and lambs were successfully infected, displaying respiratory signs (nasal discharge), moderate hyperthermia and leukopenia, viremia and viral shedding through the nasal and faecal routes. Antibody responses were observed in both animal species by ELISA and virus neutralisation assays. In contrast, inoculated piglets did not display any clinical signs nor leukopenia and viral RNA was not detected in any biological samples.

In the same period, seven PEDV strains were also isolated in Guangdong by other laboratories. The spike sequences of 10 Guangdong isolates were compared with vaccine strains and reference pathogenic isolates using six bioinformatics tools. The results revealed that 10 Guangdong strains, excluding strain GDS03, had distinct characteristics in terms of primary structure, secondary structure, high-specificity N-glycosylation sites, potential phosphorylation sites, and palmitoylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed these findings and revealed that all PEDV strains were clustered into three distinct groups. Ten Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, belong to Group 1, whereas four vaccine strains and GDS03 belong to Group 3, which is evolutionarily distant from Group 1. Alignment analysis of the neutralizing region amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions of Y/D766S, T549S, and G594S that are present in the Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, were a sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. GDS03 is closely related to the 83P-5 vaccine strain, which suggests that it might represent re-isolation of the vaccine strain or vaccine variants. Taken together, these results indicate that there have been predominant new strains circulating in Guangdong from 2011 to 2013, and the circulating PEDV strains have a genetic composition that is distant from reference strains, especially the vaccine strains; however, the vaccinations might also provide some level of cross-protection, as there have been no changes in the neutralizing epitopes of SS2 and 2C10. This explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks recently in comparison to late 2010 in which PEDV outbreaks were more frequent and severe. In addition, the USA-Colorado-2013 strain had the same amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing regions as the Guangdong strains except GDS03, which suggests that the information and strategies in this study may play role in PEDV variant research in other countries.","publish_time":"2014-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Jianwei; Xue, Chunyi; He, Liangliang; Wang, Yang; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c85702169970687f328e35a66d62c16eac33d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771495/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-014-1055-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["Guangdong strains","vaccine strains","isolated strains","reference strains","circulating PEDV strains","predominant new strains","Guangdong isolates","strain GDS03","PEDV outbreaks","strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","vaccine variants","PEDV variant research","neutralizing region amino acid sequences","amino acid substitutions of Y","neutralizing regions","palmitoylation sites","results","sign of predominant genetic changes","potential phosphorylation sites","reference pathogenic isolates","neutralizing epitopes of SS2","secondary structure","genetic composition","distinct characteristics","spike sequences","infrequent outbreaks","Alignment analysis","distinct groups","Phylogenetic analysis","high-specificity N-glycosylation sites","terms of primary structure","D766S","different swine farms","diseased pigs","T549S","study","role","comparison","bioinformatics tools","G594S","findings","re-isolation","strategies","2C10","USA-Colorado","information","countries","vaccinations","level of cross","protection","addition","period","S genes","laboratories"],"language":"en"},

By measuring conformational changes induced in a molecule by forces applied by optical tweezers, new insight has been gained into the relationship between dynamics and function.

They are characterized by odontoclastic resorptive processes, which take place at the dental root and at the periodontium. Chronic inflammation of gingiva and periodontium is believed to be an important etiological factor in the development of FORL. In this context, various feline viruses have been discussed to play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. The aim of this project was to determine in a blinded study the incidence of FORL in 10 cats which were infected for several years with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but were otherwise free of feline viral infections (feline leukemia virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, feline syncytium-forming virus). Nine age-matched controls were kept under identical conditions, but free of FIV. Subgingival resorptive lesions were found in six of 10 FIV-positive cats, but in three of nine controls only. FIV-positive cats had significantly more often gingivae with an increased tendency for bleeding upon probing than FIV-negative cats (p=0.0055), and they had slightly more often hyperplastic gingivae (p=0.0867). In conclusion, signs characteristic of FORL such as subgingival lesions, granulomatous or hyperplastic gingivae with a tendency for bleeding, were found significantly more often in FIV-positive cats than in the controls (p=0.0198). Therefore, it was concluded that FIV infection is an important factor for the occurrence of FORL, possibly through immune suppression or changes of the (sub)gingival micro-environment. However, non-infected control cats also showed some evidence of FORL in the absence of all tested viral infections. Therefore, factors other than viral infections must also play a role in the development of FORL in cats.","publish_time":"1998-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Berger, Marianne; Sigrist, Brigitte; Schawalder, Peter; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cfdbf969921def88466ba0a5177ddc8e3ed836e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119809.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001639","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FORL","FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIV-positive cats","feline parvovirus","feline herpesvirus","feline calicivirus","feline coronavirus","feline syncytium","FIV-negative cats","feline leukemia virus","feline immunodeficiency virus","free of feline viral infections","development of FORL","free of FIV","Abstract Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions","various feline viruses","evidence of FORL","occurrence of FORL","incidence of FORL","FIV infection","non-domestic cats","subgingival lesions","Subgingival resorptive lesions","non-infected control cats","signs characteristic of FORL","neck lesions","hyperplastic gingivae","tested viral infections","bleeding","important factor","odontoclastic resorptive processes","periodontium","important etiological factor","age-matched controls","increased tendency","relevant role","probing","place","identical conditions","absence","years","changes","immune suppression","blinded study","gingival micro-environment","Chronic inflammation of gingiva","dental root","conclusion","context","pathogenesis","project","factors","aim"],"language":"en"},

Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen\u0027s kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We found the overall sensitivity of 65% to be too low to replace NPA with this sampling technique in this patient category.","publish_time":"2010-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6hrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Rotz\u00E9n-\u00D6stlund, Maria; Norbeck, Oscar; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70f03de789f72ae5b9709cb6bef62c10ab8dcdef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3001728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21110854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-340","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NPA","fNS","overall sensitivity","poor sensitivity","higher sensitivity","results","nasal swabs","Paired samples","detection of respiratory viruses","nasal cavity","febrile neutropenia","total","indirect measure of cell yield","flocked nasal swab","comparison of cell yield","immunocompromised adults","upper respiratory tract symptoms","measure of agreement","copy number","immunocompetent children","invasive nasopharyngeal aspirate","hematological disorder","human beta actin gene","sampling technique","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","months","rank test","patient category","studies","panel","epithelial cells","Wilcoxon","comparisons","Cohen\u0027s kappa","METHODS","nasopharynx","BACKGROUND","study","patients","rhinovirus","CONCLUSION","pairs","specimens"],"language":"en"},

Currently, I. tinctoria is utilized more often as medicinal remedy and also as a cosmetic ingredient. In 2011, I. tinctoria root was accepted in the official European phytotherapy by introducing its monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia. The biological properties of raw material have been known from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over recent decades, I. tinctoria has been investigated both from a phytochemical and a biological point of view. The modern in vitro and in vivo scientific studies proved anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. The phytochemical composition of I. tinctoria has been thoroughly investigated and the plant was proven to contain many valuable biologically active compounds, including several alkaloids, among which tryptanthrin, indirubin, indolinone, phenolic compounds, and polysaccharides as well as glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids. This article provides a general botanical and ethnobotanical overview that summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on the phytochemistry and biological properties of this valuable plant in order to support its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the biotechnological studies on I. tinctoria, which mainly focused on hairy root cultures for the enhanced production of flavonoids and alkaloids as well as on the establishment of shoot cultures and micropropagation protocols, were reviewed. They provide input for future research prospects.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Speranza, Jasmine; Miceli, Natalizia; Taviano, Maria Fernanda; Ragusa, Salvatore; Kwiecie\u0144, Inga; Szopa, Agnieszka; Ekiert, Halina","journal":"Plants (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c61206af84102d16740c76608603d0fc8b89833.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32121532/; https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9030298","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isatis tinctoria L."],"organizations":["European Pharmacopoeia","Traditional Chinese Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tinctoria root","Isatis tinctoria","valuable plant","medicinal plant","alkaloids","biological properties of raw material","hairy root cultures","biological point of view","phenolic compounds","scientific studies","medicinal remedy","active compounds","biotechnological studies","European Pharmacopoeia","phytochemical composition of","establishment of shoot cultures","official European phytotherapy","anti-tumour","antiviral","well-documented history","indigo dye","ethnobotanical overview","up-to-date knowledge","enhanced production of flavonoids","volatile constituents","carotenoids","analgesic","polysaccharides","indolinone","monograph","indirubin","order","phytochemistry","Traditional Chinese Medicine","species","general botanical","glucosinolates","micropropagation protocols","tryptanthrin","fatty acids","input","future research prospects","TCM","article","antioxidant activities","cosmetic ingredient","therapeutic potential","Brassicaceae","recent decades","woad"],"language":"en"},

Among them are filoviruses (e.g., Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (e.g., Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbor a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways.

A recent IJHPR article by Greenberg et al. evaluated changes in emergency department care following a directive of the Israeli Ministry of Health to limit occupancy in internal medicine wards. Over a six-year observation period, they found that one-month mortality and one-week readmissions after ED visits remained unchanged, while increases in average ED visit length, as well as increased delay time from ED admission to ward were observed. These findings help to assess the impact of the occupancy limit directive and may support future health policy decisions. However, the study by Greenberg et al. was limited by the unavailability of diagnostic data, and this illustrates a significant issue that transcends this particular study. In many countries, policy-relevant administrative data are not sufficiently available on a timely basis. Data availability is the prerequisite for monitoring developments in patterns of care following health policy changes. Besides conducting retrospective studies, timely availability of data makes it possible to establish monitoring systems which may help decision makers assess the impact of policy changes, identify undesired developments early, and recognize changes in need or demand of health services within the population.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nimptsch, Ulrike","journal":"Isr J Health Policy Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eebef9033a2af69dab2edd7578871e0d2722b039.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354343/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-020-00380-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Greenberg","ED"],"organizations":["IJHPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health policy changes","impact of policy changes","future health policy decisions","evaluated changes","Data availability","policy-relevant administrative data","timely availability of data","demand of health services","Israeli Ministry of Health","monitoring developments","ED admission","Greenberg","occupancy limit directive","ED visits","unavailability of diagnostic data","patterns of care","monitoring systems","undesired developments","average ED visit length","timely basis","particular study","emergency department care","week readmissions","increased delay time","decision makers","prerequisite","recent IJHPR article","effects","retrospective studies","countries","need","internal medicine wards","significant issue","month mortality","population","year observation period","Uncertainty","findings"],"language":"en"},

Results A pathogen was detected in 12 febrile ACS (19.7%): four viruses (6.6%) (Rhinovirus; Influenza A/B), seven bacteria (11.4%) (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae), one mixed infection (1.6%) (S. aureus and Influenza B). NAAT only detected L. pneumophila in one case (serogroup 2).

Sputum smear microscopy remains the most widely available pulmonary TB diagnostic tool particularly in resource limited settings. A highly sensitive diagnostic with minimal infrastructure, cost and training is required. Hence, we assessed the diagnostic performance of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay in detecting M.tuberculosis infection in sputum sample compared to LED fluorescent smear microscopy and culture. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Hospital from June 01, 2015 to August 30, 2015. Pulmonary TB diagnosis using sputum LED fluorescence smear microscopy, TB-LAMP assay and culture were done. A descriptive analysis was used to determine demographic characteristics of the study participants. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity for smear microscopy and TB-LAMP compared with culture as a reference test was performed. Cohen\u2019s kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement between the tests. RESULTS: A total of 78 pulmonary presumptive TB patients sputum sample were analyzed. The overall sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were 75 and 98%, respectively. Among smear negative sputum samples, 33.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity of LAMP were observed. Smear microscopy showed 78.6% sensitivity and 98% specificity. LAMP and smear in series had sensitivity of 67.8% and specificity of 100%. LAMP and smear in parallel had sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 96%. The agreement between LAMP and fluorescent smear microscopy tests was very good (\u03BA = 0.83, P-value \u22640.0001). CONCLUSIONS: TB-LAMP showed similar specificity but a slightly lower sensitivity with LED fluorescence microscopy. The specificity of LAMP and smear microscopy in series was high. The sensitivity of LAMP was insufficient for smear negative sputum samples.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gelaw, Baye; Shiferaw, Yitayal; Alemayehu, Marta; Bashaw, Abate Assefa","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c58d98057dc1e0a42c7aede5b3a5ac493a4d99e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5240421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-2140-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["University of Gondar Hospital","LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitivity of LAMP","specificity of LAMP","Sputum smear microscopy","TB-LAMP assay","sputum LED fluorescence smear microscopy","LED fluorescent smear microscopy","fluorescent smear microscopy tests","smear negative sputum samples","Analysis of sensitivity","lower sensitivity","overall sensitivity","similar specificity","LED fluorescence microscopy","Pulmonary TB diagnosis","pulmonary presumptive TB patients sputum sample","available pulmonary TB diagnostic tool","culture","sensitive diagnostic","tuberculosis infection","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","series","diagnostic performance of Loop","measure of agreement","cross-sectional study","study participants","descriptive analysis","isothermal amplification","leading causes of death","minimal infrastructure","cost","resource limited settings","total","demographic characteristics","infectious diseases","training","CONCLUSIONS","University of Gondar Hospital","P-value","reference test","Cohen\u2019s kappa","METHOD","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Yet, the public sector\u0027s predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms\u0027 intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; \u201Coptimising\u201D the employment services\u201D in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen \u2013 or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuziemski, Maciej; Misuraca, Gianluca","journal":"Telecomm Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c6eb863e01fd4c95e46a1f4be91bb98b2013c7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164913.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596120300689?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308596120300689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public services","use of AI","governance systems","digital devices","digital society","digital solutions","public sector\u0027s predicament","wide adoption of AI","existing data governance regimes","employment services","digital service experience","potential impact","governments","potential of technology","citizens","prevalent role","specific effects of automated decision support systems","underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems","potential algorithmic harms","large scale data collections","paper advocates","common framework","policy instruments","negative effects","dual role","national regulatory practices","existing power asymmetries","crucial policy issues","rule-based programming lacks","immigration process control system","Canada","current COVID","tragic double bind","obligations","strenghtening","emergency crisis","challenge","optimising","externalities","innovations","Finland","new socio-economic contexts","real-time accessibility of information","growing expectations","algorithms\u0027 intrinsic properties","light","odds","need","relationships","Poland","particular importance","matter of debate","temptation","rush","far-ranging consequences","institutions","trust","democracy","pressures","efficiency","walk of life","words","end","regard"],"language":"en"},

A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, a Nomogram was built and the predictive accuracy was evaluated through the calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve, and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis.

Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for disease progression. The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*10(9)/L, respectively.

High throughput experiments to identify RNA-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of RNA-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-protein interactions. RESULTS: We propose RPISeq, a family of classifiers for predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information. Given the sequences of an RNA and a protein as input, RPIseq predicts whether or not the RNA-protein pair interact. The RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. Two variants of RPISeq are presented: RPISeq-SVM, which uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and RPISeq-RF, which uses a Random Forest classifier. On two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the Protein-RNA Interface Database (PRIDB), RPISeq achieved an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. On a third dataset containing only mRNA-protein interactions, the performance of RPISeq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mRNA half-life, GO annotations) of the putative RNA and protein partners. In addition, RPISeq classifiers trained using the PRIDB data correctly predicted the majority (57-99%) of non-coding RNA-protein interactions in NPInter-derived networks from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments with RPISeq demonstrate that RNA-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. RPISeq offers an inexpensive method for computational construction of RNA-protein interaction networks, and should provide useful insights into the function of non-coding RNAs.

Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) as a convenient and inexpensive antibody has been widely applied to the therapy of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to produce IgY specific to PDR-Ab and investigate its antibacterial effects in vitro and in vivo. IgYs specific to two PDR-Ab strains were produced by immunizing hens with formaldehyde inactivated PDR-Ab cells and isolated from yolks with a purity of 90% by water dilution, salt precipitations and ultrafiltration. IgYs showed high titers when subjected to an ELISA and inhibited the growth of PDR-Ab in a dose-dependent manner in liquid medium. Scanning electron microscopy assay showed structural modification and aggregation of PDR-Ab treated with specific IgYs. Freshly cultured PDR-Ab cells were nasally inhaled in BALB/c mice to induce acute pneumonia. The infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with specific IgYs using cefoperazone/sulbactam and dexamethasone as positive controls. The IgYs specific to PDR-Ab lowered the mortality of mice with PDR-Ab-induced acute pneumonia, decreased the level of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1\u03B2 in serum and reduced inflammation in lung tissue. Specific IgY has the potential to be used as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of A. baumannii-induced infections.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Huaying; Zhu, Jie; Zou, Boyang; Shi, Lei; Du, Linying; Long, Yayi; Wang, Huaxin; Xu, Hong; Zhen, Yuhong; Sun, Lidan","journal":"Biomedicine \u0026 Pharmacotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2e23dac907018e5311d7a8aff1b778a85265af6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126593.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2017.09.112; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332217300847; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332217300847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28962078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDR-Ab strains","treatment of PDR","Ab infections","cultured PDR-Ab cells","aggregation of PDR","growth of PDR","IgYs specific","specific IgYs","formaldehyde inactivated PDR-Ab cells","acute pneumonia","mortality of mice","c mice","baumannii-induced infections","infected mice","new strategies","new therapeutic approach","drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii","structural modification","immunizing hens","serum","sulbactam","growing emergence of pan","dose-dependent manner","water dilution","reduced inflammation","dexamethasone","cefoperazone","BALB","electron microscopy assay","level of TNF","salt precipitations","ultrafiltration","lung tissue","purity","liquid medium","ELISA","yolks","positive controls","Abstract","high titers","Egg yolk immunoglobulin","antibacterial effects","therapy of infectious diseases","inexpensive antibody","study","potential","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sentinel and study sites collected nasopharyngeal specimens for diagnostic detection, virus isolation, antigenic characterization, sequencing and antiviral susceptibility analysis from patients who fulfilled case definitions for influenza-like illness, acute lower respiratory infections and event-based surveillance. Each year in Cambodia, influenza viruses were detected mainly from June to November, during the rainy season. Antigenic analysis show that A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the A/California/7/2009-like group. Circulating A/H3N2 strains were A/Brisbane/10/2007-like in 2009 before drifting to A/Perth/16/2009-like in 2010 and 2011. The Cambodian influenza B isolates from 2009 to 2011 all belonged to the B/Victoria lineage represented by the vaccine strains B/Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. Sequences of the M2 gene obtained from representative 2009\u20132011 A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 strains all contained the S31N mutation associated with adamantanes resistance except for one A/H1N1pdm09 strain isolated in 2011 that lacked this mutation. No reduction in the susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was observed among the influenza viruses circulating from 2009 to 2011. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/H3N2 strains clustered each year to a distinct group while most A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the S203T clade. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In Cambodia, from 2009 to 2011, influenza activity occurred throughout the year with peak seasonality during the rainy season from June to November. Seasonal influenza epidemics were due to multiple genetically distinct viruses, even though all of the isolates were antigenically similar to the reference vaccine strains. The drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains revealed that neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective.","publish_time":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horm, Srey Viseth; Mardy, Sek; Rith, Sareth; Ly, Sovann; Heng, Seng; Vong, Sirenda; Kitsutani, Paul; Ieng, Vannra; Tarantola, Arnaud; Ly, Sowath; Sar, Borann; Chea, Nora; Sokhal, Buth; Barr, Ian; Kelso, Anne; Horwood, Paul F.; Timmermans, Ans; Hurt, Aeron; Lon, Chanthap; Saunders, David; Ung, Sam An; Asgari, Nima; Roces, Maria Concepcion; Touch, Sok; Komadina, Naomi; Buchy, Philippe","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb6be6d67dbc92ee528f4c09ca1643eeda4316bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4207757.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340711/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Influenza Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["circulating influenza strains","influenza viruses","influenza treatment","influenza activity","H1N1pdm09 strains","Cambodian influenza B isolates","H3N2 strains","drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains","vaccine strains B","Seasonal influenza epidemics","H1N1pdm09 isolates","Cambodian National Influenza Center","reference vaccine strains","year","Antigenic analysis","distinct viruses","antiviral susceptibility analysis","neuraminidase inhibitors","Phylogenetic analysis","Brisbane","distinct group","rainy season","antigenic characterization","drug of choice","adamantanes resistance","S31N mutation","diagnostic detection","sequencing","study sites","nasopharyngeal specimens","virus isolation","Sentinel","illness","patients","acute lower respiratory infections","case definitions","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","event-based surveillance","chemoprophylaxis","peak seasonality","Victoria lineage","BACKGROUND","M2 gene","METHODOLOGY","reduction","S203T clade","Sequences","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","California","Malaysia","Perth"],"language":"en"},

All of the diseased chicks showed some or all of the clinical signs of infectious bronchitis including gasping, coughing and nasal discharge, wet eyes, swollen sinuses, reduction of food consumption and weight gain. Diagnosis of IBV was based on clinical signs and ELISA test. Blood samples were taken from the wing vein into two tubes: one containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and one without EDTA. Haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA) and protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA) concentrations were measured. All of the study variables were significantly higher in diseased birds compared with control group. Results showed that there were significant positive correlations between TSA, LBSA and PBSA in both groups. No correlation was observed between Hp and SAA with any other parameters; however, there was significant negative correlation between Hp and SAA in the control group. Results for receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that area under the curve (AUC) for TSA, LBSA, PBSA, Hp and SAA were 0.93, 0.98, 0.90, 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. According to AUC, LBSA was the most sensitive factor to change in the diseased birds. It can be concluded that in naturally occurring IBV infection, significant increases in TSA, LBSA, PBSA, Hp and SAA concentrations are expected and among study variables, LBSA had the most obvious change so it may be considered as the most sensitive parameter.","publish_time":"2009-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazifi, S.; Tabande, M.

However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population. We also demonstrate that AstroV might be a larger burden to urban ducks than IAV, and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses. The presence of economically relevant viruses in urban Mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments, which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife, food production animals, and humans.","publish_time":"2017-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Lindqvist, Kristine; Muradrasoli, Shaman; Olsen, Bj\u00F6rn; J\u00E4rhult, Josef D.","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/391ab6bd1f4e73c8d649f0c3c806db59a3395b00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106234.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817301028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323070/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134817301028; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.03.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Urban ducks","wild ducks","urban Mallards","urban population","RNA viruses","urban environments","wild birds","resident population of ducks","relevant viruses","food production birds","wild migratory birds","autumnal prevalence of IAV","CoV","avian paramyxovirus","avian coronavirus","avian astrovirus","humans","similar annual patterns","food production animals","artificial pond","fecal samples","effect of urbanization","ecology of wildlife pathogens","similar ecological factors","intra-annual dataset","epidemiology of infectious diseases","disease risks","importance","larger burden","natural host-pathogen systems","winter months","Anas platyrhynchos","comparison","influenza","popular location","central Uppsala","Sweden","play","presence","interesting niche","degree"],"language":"en"},

Zoonotic infections with Vaccinia virus (VACV) were first reported in Brazil in 1999, VACV is an emerging zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which primarily infects dairy cattle and farmers in close contact with infected cows. Prospective studies of emerging pathogens could provide critical data that would inform public health planning and response to outbreaks. By using the location of 87-recorded outbreaks and publicly available bioclimatic data, we demonstrate one such approach. Using an ecological niche model (ENM) algorithm, we identify the environmental conditions under which VACV outbreaks have occurred, and determine additional locations in two affected countries that may be susceptible to transmission. Further, we show how suitability for the virus responds to different levels of various environmental factors and highlight the most important factors in determining its transmission. METHODS: A literature review was performed and the geospatial coordinates of 87 molecularly confirmed VACV outbreaks in Brazil were identified. An ENM was generated using MaxENT software by combining principal component analysis results of 19 bioclim spatial layers, and 25 randomly selected subsets of the original list of 87 outbreaks. RESULTS: The final ENM predicted all areas where Brazilian outbreaks occurred, one out of five of the Colombian outbreak regions and identified new regions within Brazil that are suitable for transmission based on bioclimatic factors. Further, the most important factors in determining transmission suitability are precipitation of the wettest quarter, annual precipitation, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean diurnal range. CONCLUSION: The analyses here provide a means by which to study patterns of an emerging infectious disease and identify regions that are potentially suitable for its transmission, in spite of the paucity of high-quality critical data. Policy and methods for the control of infectious diseases often use a reactionary model, addressing diseases only after significant impact on human health has ensued. The methodology used in the present work allows the identification of areas where disease is likely to appear, which could be used for directed intervention.

The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2 years, hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. RESULTS: A total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases. In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses. Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains. CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide. Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. If these preliminary observations will be confirmed, improved molecular methods with a wider panel of potential pathogens will be useful for monitoring these categories of patients.","publish_time":"2012-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Debiaggi, Maurizia; Ceresola, Elisa Rita; Sampaolo, Michela; Alessandrino, Emilio Paolo; Brerra, Roberto; Piazza, Aurora; Clementi, Massimo; Canducci, Filippo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3477084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22947270/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Nicaragua"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","presence of EV109","positive samples","infants","role of EV109","EV109 RNA","cases of respiratory illness","common respiratory viruses","patients populations","categories of patients","acute respiratory diseases","upper respiratory simptoms","co-infection","adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients","lower ARDs","HEV109 infection","transplant recipients","RESULTS","study","species HEV-C","Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions","viral pathogens","absence of co-infecting viruses","RT-PCR","HEV109 variants","reverse transcription-PCR","wider panel of potential pathogens","type","novel human enterovirus","years","nucleotide differences","molecular methods","larger studies","BACKGROUND","total","Nicaraguan strains","nasopharingeal aspirates","clinical symptoms","different lineages","preliminary observations","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

We aimed at testing the feasibility of this approach for use in a long-term study focusing on infections in children in Germany. METHODS: Parents of 1- to 3-year-old children (n = 75) were recruited in nursery schools. They were asked to complete a symptom diary on a daily basis and to take monthly and symptom-triggered nasal swabs and stool samples from their child over the study period of three months. Feasibility was measured by means of the return proportions of symptom diaries and bio samples; acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire delivered to participants at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants filled in the symptom diary during the three months study for 75 or more days (77.3 %), and provided the monthly nasal swabs (62.7 %) and stool samples (65.3 %). The time needed for the tasks was acceptable for most participants (symptom diary: 92.3 %, nasal swabs: 98.5 %, stool samples: 100.0 %). In 64.3 % of the symptom-triggered nasal swabs, respiratory viruses were found compared to 55.5 % in throat swabs taken by health-care professionals within the \u201CARE surveillance Lower Saxony\u201D, a special project by the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony to investigate causal pathogens for acute respiratory infections in children. CONCLUSIONS: The parental assessment of symptoms and collection of biomaterials in a birth cohort dedicated to studying infections appears feasible in a middle class German population. The success of the study will depend on the ability to maintain these activities over a long time period.

Recent findings suggest that lncRNAs play various regulatory roles in multiple major biological and pathological processes.

In contrast to proteins that function in viral infection, lncRNAs are expected to be novel targets for the modulation of all types of biochemical processes due to their broad characteristics and profound influence. This review highlights our current understanding of the regulatory roles of lncRNAs during viral infection processes with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of lncRNAs as a target for viral intervention strategies, which could have therapeutic implications for the application of a clinical approach for the treatment of viral diseases.","publish_time":"2017-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ziqiang; Zhao, Yiwan; Zhang, Yaou","journal":"Noncoding RNA Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/488e866a3ed2d3764a91dad6a668a304859ce1ad.json; document_parses/pdf_json/464f7d3a460eb51dbc25bd12639b22079a73f85a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6096409.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468054016300294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159419/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468054016300294; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrna.2017.03.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","viral latency","viral transformation","viral infection processes","regulatory roles of lncRNAs","viral gene expression","viral intervention strategies","treatment of viral diseases","viral life cycles","potential usefulness of lncRNAs","pathological processes","various regulatory roles","types of biochemical processes","emphasis","virion release","genome packaging","broad characteristics","modulation","clinical approach","host antiviral","current understanding","application","therapeutic implications","immune responses","novel targets","Recent findings","series of steps","profound influence","non-coding RNAs","proteins","organisms","review","contrast","mammals","viruses"],"language":"en"},

We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walls, Alexandra C.; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M.

The story of SARS illustrates vividly some NOS features advocated in the school science curriculum, including the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social and cultural practices. The story also provided some insights into a number of NOS features less emphasised in the school curriculum\u2014for example, the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty and the courage to challenge authority, the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research and the \u2018peace of mind\u2019 of researchers, These less emphasised elements provided empirical evidence that NOS knowledge, like scientific knowledge itself, changes over time.

A review of records, colostrum and feeding routines, housing and bedding management, routine procedures, vaccination, and treatment protocols begins the investigation and determines which diagnostic procedures and testing strategies are most useful. Disease management is most effective when the problem source is well defined and the exposure can be limited, calf immunity can be enhanced, or a combination of both. Screening examinations performed regularly or done at strategic time points improves detection of disease, can be used to monitor treatment outcomes, and can avoid disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2008-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGuirk, Sheila M.","journal":"Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b66b7144b68674c9f2a22d7ba6bd60826adde0a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135781.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749072007000722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299036/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvfa.2007.10.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749072007000722","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease management","detection of disease","treatment of herd","disease outbreaks","bedding management","treatment protocols","treatment outcomes","routine procedures","diagnostic procedures","systematic herd investigation strategy","based problems","important risk factors","important diseases of dairy calves","heifers","housing","vaccination","clinical approaches","routines","plan","strategic time points","exposure","colostrum","problem source","testing strategies","diagnosis","recommendations","review of records","calf immunity","article","Screening examinations","combination"],"language":"en"},

According to a long\u2010standing but unproven hypothesis dating to initial descriptions of multiple sclerosis (MS) at the end of the 19th century, viruses are either directly or indirectly implicated in MS pathogenesis. Whether viruses in MS are principally causal or simply contributory remains to be proven, but many viruses or viral elements\u2014predominantly Epstein\u2010Barr virus, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV\u20106) but also less common viruses such as Saffold and measles viruses\u2014are associated with MS. Here, we present an up\u2010to\u2010date and comprehensive review of the main candidate viruses implicated in MS pathogenesis and summarize how these viruses might cause or lead to the hallmark demyelinating and inflammatory lesions of MS.

We argue that it is crucially important not to interpret \u201Cabsence of evidence\u201D as \u201Cevidence of absence\u201D and that future studies need to focus on distinguishing correlative from causative associations. Progress in the MS\u2010virus field is expected to arise from an increasing body of knowledge on the interplay between viruses and HERVs in MS. Such interactions suggest common HERV\u2010mediated pathways downstream of viral infection that cause both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

At present, there is significant data available about molecular mechanisms that regulate autophagy. Nevertheless, autophagy pathway itself and its importance in different cellular aspects are still not completely clear. In this article, we are focused in four main aspects: (a) Induction of Autophagy: Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism induced by nutrient starvation or lack of growth factors. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy is a cell response to stress which starts as a consequence of organelle damage, such as oxidative species and other stress conditions. (b) Initiation of Autophagy; The two major actors in this signaling process are mTOR and AMPK. These multitasking protein complexes are capable to summarize the whole environmental, nutritional, and energetic status of the cell and promote the autophagy induction by means of the ULK1-Complex, that is the first member in the autophagy initiation. (c) ULK1-Complex: This is a highly regulated complex responsible for the initiation of autophagosome formation. We review the post-transductional modifications of this complex, considering the targets of ULK1. (d)The mechanisms involved in autophagosome formation. In this section we discuss the main events that lead to the initial structures in autophagy. The BECN1-Complex with PI3K activity and the proper recognition of PI3P are one of these. Also, the transmembrane proteins, such as VMP1 and ATG9, are critically involved. The membrane origin and the cellular localization of autophagosome biogenesis will be also considered. Hence, in this article we present an overview of the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial steps of mammalian cell autophagosome biogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grasso, Daniel; Renna, Felipe Javier; Vaccaro, Maria Ines","journal":"Front Cell Dev Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79662c9f0c15fef224326790833945e2a1f88ce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30406104/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2018.00146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Initiation of Autophagy","autophagy initiation","Induction of Autophagy","autophagy induction","autophagy pathway","ULK1-Complex","BECN1-Complex","initiation of autophagosome formation","cellular localization of autophagosome biogenesis","cellular settings","cellular homeostasis","molecular mechanisms","different cellular aspects","initial steps of mammalian cell autophagosome biogenesis","cell response","main aspects","targets of ULK1","present","article","initial structures","central process","stress conditions","main events","nutrient starvation","consequent implication","PI3K activity","significant data available","oxidative species","conserved mechanism","importance","lack of growth factors","human diseases pathology","proper recognition of PI3P","energetic status","current knowledge","major actors","consequence of organelle damage","membrane origin","higher eukaryotes","VMP1","multitasking protein complexes","overview","mTOR","post-transductional modifications","member","transmembrane proteins","ATG9","AMPK","section","decade"],"language":"en"},

Summary Community-acquired viral bronchopneumonia is frequent, particularly in children, and can be associated with all types of respiratory viruses. Immature immunity explains the vulnerability to respiratory pathogens during childhood. Epithelial cells distributed throughout the airway epithelium are the target of viruses. Epidemiological studies report a decrease in respiratory function in adults, regardless of confounding factors, who had pneumonia before the age of 2 or even 7years. This reduction in respiratory function is a consequence of the initial involvement and of the accelerated physiological decline in adulthood. Studies on the origin of bronchial dilatation have found a history of infectious pneumonia in more than 50% of cases. Adenoviral infections in particular are involved. Postinfectious obstructive bronchiolitis can occur even in immunocompetent children. The initial clinical picture is often flu-like, and is subsequently marked by a dissociation between important functional signs and a poor clinical presentation. The long-term course is not predictable but can lead to lethal chronic respiratory failure. Diffuse infiltrative pneumonitis is characterized by pulmonary diffuse infiltration with inflammatory cells and fibrosis. The role of viruses in its development has been mentioned due to the presence of cellular inclusions evoking viral particles in the lungs of affected children. Finally, most epidemiological studies emphasize the association between wheezing symptoms secondary to viral infection in childhood and the subsequent risk of developing asthma.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, J.; Vallet, C.; Marie, J.; Faucon, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d3fa6e484df23c41bdbb2b55fd13e733225ea49.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588932X20300541; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588932X20300541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The long","the target","the origin","The role","to the presence","the initial involvement","the subsequent risk","decrease in respiratory function in adults","particularly in children","the accelerated physiological decline in adulthood","This reduction in respiratory function is","cellular inclusions evoking viral particles in the lungs","The initial clinical picture is often flu","viruses in its development","respiratory viruses","Adenoviral infections in particular","most epidemiological studies emphasize the association between wheezing symptoms secondary to viral infection in childhood","who had pneumonia before the age","infectious pneumonia in more than","Immature immunity explains the vulnerability to respiratory pathogens during childhood","Epithelial cells distributed throughout the airway epithelium","Postinfectious obstructive bronchiolitis can occur even in immunocompetent children","term course is","is subsequently marked","infiltration diffuse","acquired viral bronchopneumonia is frequent","diminution de la fonction respiratoire","r\u00E9duction de la fonction respiratoire","infiltrative pneumonitis is characterized","infection virale respiratoire aigu\u00EB","predictable but can lead to lethal chronic respiratory failure","Epidemiological studies report","affected children","tableau initial","poumon","\u00E2ge adulte","d\u00E9veloppement","enfance","cible des virus","plupart des \u00E9tudes \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques","\u00E9tudes portant","r\u00F4le des virus","can be associated with","infiltration with inflammatory cells","insuffisance respiratoire chronique l\u00E9tale","inclusions cellulaires","or even","agression virale","cellules inflammatoires","enfant immunocomp\u00E9tent","dissociation between important functional signs","poor clinical presentation","\u00E9pith\u00E9lium des voies respiratoires","symptomatologie sifflante secondaire","pneumopathies infiltratives diffuses","bronchiolite obstructive post","ant\u00E9c\u00E9dents de pneumopathies infectieuses","cellules cili\u00E9es distribu\u00E9es","confounding factors","regardless","history","pulmonary","like","mentioned","consequence","bronchial dilatation","processus de r\u00E9paration","signes fonctionnels importants","particules virales","types","acc\u00E9l\u00E9ration du d\u00E9clin physiologique","part de la vuln\u00E9rabilit\u00E9","croissance pulmonaire","Summary Community","charpente conjonctivale","alt\u00E9ration potentielle","bronches","raison de la pr\u00E9sence","reflet probable","Finally","examen clinique pauvre","origine des dilatations","facteurs confondants","risque ult\u00E9rieur","developing asthma","immaturit\u00E9 du syst\u00E8me immunitaire","capacit\u00E9s ventilatoires","pneumonie","pseudo","fibrosis","involved","enfants atteints","outils mol\u00E9culaires","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","asthme","years","\u00E9volution","cases","ad\u00E9novirus","cause","fois","fibrose","ans"],"language":"fr"},

METHODS: The in vitro study elucidated inhibitory effects of astragalin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside from leaves of persimmon and green tea seeds, on oxidative stress-induced airway fibrosis. The in vivo study explored the demoting effects of astragalin on epithelial to mesenchymal transition in BALB/c mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). RESULTS: The exposure of 20 \u03BCM H(2)O(2) for 72 h accelerated E-cadherin loss and vimentin induction in airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells, which was reversed by non-toxic astragalin at 1\u201320 \u03BCM. Astragalin allayed the airway tissue levels of ROS and vimentin enhanced by OVA challenge. Collagen type 1 production increased in H(2)O(2)\u2013exposed epithelial cells and collagen fiber deposition was observed in OVA-challenged mouse airways. This study further investigated that the oxidative stress-triggered autophagic regulation was responsible for inducing airway fibrosis. H(2)O(2) highly enhanced the expression induction of the autophagy-related beclin-1 and light chains 3A/B (LC3A/B) within 4 h and astragalin blocked such induction by H(2)O(2). This compound deterred the ROS-promoted autophagosome formation in BEAS-2B cells. Consistently, in OVA-sensitized mice the expression of beclin-1 and LC3A/B was highly induced, and oral administration of astragalin suppressed the autophagosome formation with inhibiting the induction of these proteins in OVA-challenged airway subepithelium. Induction of autophagy by spermidine influenced the epithelial induction of E-cadherin and vimentin that was blocked by treating astragalin. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that astragalin can be effective in allaying ROS-promoted bronchial fibrosis through inhibiting autophagosome formation in airways.","publish_time":"2015-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, In-Hee; Choi, Yean-Jung; Gong, Ju-Hyun; Shin, Daekeun; Kang, Min-Kyung; Kang, Young-Hee","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/424cd6cb670119aed604833cf1f107598f217574.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4406173.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-015-0211-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25895672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vimentin induction","non-toxic astragalin","airway epithelial BEAS","epithelial induction of E","expression induction","Induction of autophagy","B cells","\u03BCM H","inducing airway fibrosis","inhibitory effects of astragalin","demoting effects of astragalin","airway subepithelium","oral administration of astragalin","oxidative stress-induced airway fibrosis","airway tissue levels of ROS","OVA-sensitized mice","OVA challenge","O-glucoside","study","exposed epithelial cells","Fibrotic remodeling of airway","inhibiting autophagosome formation","allaying ROS","bronchial fibrosis","h accelerated E-cadherin loss","idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","expression of beclin","LC3A","RESULTS","autophagy-related beclin","pulmonary dysfunction","c mice","Collagen type","mouse airways","oxidative stress-triggered autophagic regulation","lung parenchymal compartments","chronic lung diseases","collagen fiber deposition","green tea seeds","mesenchymal transition","leaves of persimmon","involvement of reactive oxygen species","BALB","kaempferol","spermidine","light chains","ovalbumin","proteins","BACKGROUND","asthma","production","exposure","METHODS","compound","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: There were 11 male and 8 female cases among the patients. The median (range) age was 73 (38\u201391) years. Of these patients, 8 (42.1%) had died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (interquartile range (IQR): 1\u201310.75) days. Seven of these 8 patients had underlying diseases. The auxiliary examination showed fever (68.4%), dry cough (15.8%), dyspnea (10.5%), and diarrhea (5.3%). All 19 cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography. Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases. Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors. CONCLUSION: There were more men than women among critically ill patients.

This chapter discusses those viral diseases of importance to nonhuman primates and their caregivers by taxonomic family to which the causative agent is classified. A doctrine of comparative virology is that infection of the immunocompetent, appropriate host often is associated with minimal disease, whereas infection of the inadvertent susceptible host can have devastating consequences. The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment place different species in close proximity. Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease. Perhaps of equal importance is the realization that experimental manipulations may inadvertently expose animals to unrecognized pathogens with lethal consequences. For instance, a number of minimally pathogenic viruses may cause severe disease in animals immunosuppressed from pharmacologic manipulation or immunodeficient from concurrent infection with viruses that target the immune system. Numerous examples of each of these scenarios are documented within this chapter.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wachtman, Lynn; Mansfield, Keith","journal":"Nonhuman Primates in Biomedical Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bfdf60043bb7585d900b16354307bf8044d9075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150127.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123813664000018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123813664000018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonprimate host","appropriate host","severe disease","animals","concurrent infection","inadvertent susceptible host","viral diseases of importance","minimal disease","transmission of viral agents","Viral infections","chapter","zoological colonies of nonhuman primates","pathogenic viruses","equal importance","lethal consequences","devastating consequences","pharmacologic manipulation","environment place different species","health of laboratory","immunodeficient","taxonomic family","close proximity","changes","potential threat","experimental manipulations","caregivers","unrecognized pathogens","realization","doctrine of comparative virology","causative agent","scenarios","number","personnel","immune system","Numerous examples","instance","likelihood"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Forty adults, 18\u201350 years, were randomly assigned to intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, (weeks 0, 4, 8) by Biojector\u00AE 2000\u2122 or needle and syringe (N/S) and boosted IM at week 24 with VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5) with N/S at 10(10) or 10(11) particle units (PU). Equal numbers per assigned schedule had low (\u2264500) or high (\u003E500) reciprocal titers of preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: 120 DNA and 39 rAd5 injections were given; 36 subjects completed follow-up research sample collections. IFN-\u03B3 ELISpot response rates were 17/19 (89%) for Biojector\u00AE and 13/17 (76%) for N/S delivery at Week 28 (4 weeks post rAd5 boost). The magnitude of ELISpot response was about 3-fold higher in Biojector\u00AE compared to N/S groups. Similar effects on response rates and magnitude were observed for CD8\u002B, but not CD4\u002B T-cell responses by ICS. Env-specific antibody responses were about 10-fold higher in Biojector-primed subjects. CONCLUSIONS: DNA vaccination by Biojector\u00AE was well-tolerated and compared to needle injection, primed for greater IFN-\u03B3 ELISpot, CD8\u002B T-cell, and antibody responses after rAd5 boosting.

Although the initial interaction of JCV with host cells occurs through direct binding of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) with cell-surface molecules possessing sialic acid, these molecules have not yet been identified. In order to isolate monoclonal antibodies which inhibit attachment of JCV, we established an immunoscreening system using virus-like particles consisting of the VP1. Using this system, among monoclonal antibodies against the cell membrane fraction from JCV-permissive human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, we isolated a monoclonal antibody designated as 24D2 that specifically inhibited attachment and infection of JCV to IMR-32 cells. The antibody 24D2 recognized a single molecule of around 60kDa in molecular weight in the IMR-32 membrane fraction. Immunohistochemical staining with 24D2 demonstrated immunoreactivity in the cell membrane of JCV-permissive cell lines and glial cells of the human brain. These results suggested that the molecule recognized by 24D2 plays a role in JCV infection, and that it might participate as a receptor or a co-receptor in JCV attachment and entry into the cells.","publish_time":"2005-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henmi, Chizuka; Sawa, Hirofumi; Iwata, Hiroshi; Orba, Yasuko; Tanaka, Shinya; Nagashima, Kazuo","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f746c812c39e7685944fa61ecbec816b684415c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117536.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04027561; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04027561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of JCV","JCV infection","attachment of JCV","JCV attachment","cell membrane of JCV","JCV-permissive human neuroblastoma IMR","initial interaction of JCV","cell membrane fraction","glial cells","host cells","antibody 24D2","monoclonal antibodies","monoclonal antibody","permissive cell lines","cell-surface molecules","human brain","inhibited attachment","VP1","fatal human demyelinating disease","co-receptor","single molecule","immunoscreening system","direct binding","major viral capsid protein","immunoreactivity","progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","kDa","sialic acid","entry","particles","molecular weight","Abstract Polyomavirus JC","role","Immunohistochemical staining","order","results"],"language":"en"},

However, little has been reported on in vitro interactions of coinfected viruses. To explore how coinfection of different viruses affects their biological property, we examined growth of influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) during coinfection of Vero cells. We found that IAV growth was enhanced by coinfection with hPIV2. The enhanced growth of IAV was not reproduced by coinfection with an hPIV2 mutant with reduced cell fusion activity, or by ectopic expression of the V protein of hPIV2. In contrast, induction of cell fusion by ectopic expression of the hPIV2 HN and F proteins augments IAV growth. hPIV2 coinfection supported IAV growth in cells originated from the respiratory epithelium. The enhancement correlated closely with cell fusion ability of hPIV2 in those cells. These results indicate that cell fusion induced by hPIV2 infection is beneficial to IAV replication and that enhanced viral replication by coinfection with different viruses can modify their pathological consequences.","publish_time":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goto, Hideo; Ihira, Hironobu; Morishita, Keiichi; Tsuchiya, Mitsuki; Ohta, Keisuke; Yumine, Natsuko; Tsurudome, Masato; Nishio, Machiko","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d4db3ef10d5283d7c5b7e24c72a484491167dbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26582554/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-015-0441-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hPIV2 coinfection","enhanced growth of IAV","hPIV2 HN","hPIV2 mutant","hPIV2 infection","cell fusion ability of hPIV2","IAV replication","coinfection of different viruses","coinfection of Vero cells","V protein of hPIV2","induction of cell fusion","growth of influenza","F proteins augments IAV growth","reduced cell fusion activity","epithelial cells","multiple viruses","ectopic expression","interactions of coinfected viruses","viral replication","respiratory tract","respiratory epithelium","human parainfluenza virus type","biological property","pathological consequences","contrast","enhancement","results"],"language":"en"},

A century since the 1918\u20131919 Spanish influenza pandemic\u2014the largest and deadliest influenza pandemic in recorded history\u2014we have learned much about pandemic influenza and the origins of antigenic drift among influenza A viruses. Despite this knowledge, we remain largely underprepared for when the next major pandemic occurs. While emergency departments are likely to care for the first cases of pandemic influenza, intensive care units (ICUs) will certainly see the sickest and will likely have the most complex issues regarding resource allocation. Intensivists must therefore be prepared for the next pandemic influenza virus. Preparation requires multiple steps, including careful surveillance for new pandemics, a scalable response system to respond to surge capacity, vaccine production mechanisms, coordinated communication strategies, and stream-lined research plans for timely initiation during a pandemic. Conservative models of a large-scale influenza pandemic predict more than 170% utilization of ICU-level resources. When faced with pandemic influenza, ICUs must have a strategy for resource allocation as strain increases on the system. There are several current threats, including avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses. As humans continue to live in closer proximity to each other, travel more extensively, and interact with greater numbers of birds and livestock, the risk of emergence of the next pandemic influenza virus mounts. Now is the time to prepare and coordinate local, national, and global efforts.","publish_time":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kain, Taylor; Fowler, Robert","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40c15d7dfd277d6c181783e56c9c996664c2ba5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6819413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665057/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-019-2616-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","deadliest influenza pandemic","cases of pandemic influenza","Spanish influenza pandemic","large-scale influenza pandemic","avian influenza","pandemic influenza virus mounts","major pandemic","ICUs","resource allocation","recorded history","scalable response system","intensive care units","course of human history","coordinated communication strategies","stream-lined research plans","new pandemics","careful surveillance","vaccine production mechanisms","capacity","timely initiation","livestock","origins of antigenic drift","strategy","multiple steps","risk of emergence","strain","Conservative models","utilization of ICU","greater numbers of birds","global efforts","level resources","Preparation","complex issues","H5N1","current threats","humans","closer proximity","emergency departments","H7N9","century","knowledge","Intensivists"],"language":"en"},

In a few countries, the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies. In contrast, the United States, hampered by limited testing capacity, has prioritized testing for specific groups of persons. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\u2013based assays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging. Although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation. Many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity. These challenges may be even greater in low-resource settings. Urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for SARS\u2013CoV-2 infection.

There have been several Ebola virus outbreaks since the first outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976 of which, the recent 2013\u20132015 epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is the largest in recorded history. Within a few months of the start of the outbreak in December 2013, thousands of infected cases were reported with a significant number of deaths. As of March 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been nearly 25 000 suspected cases, with 15 000 confirmed by laboratory testing, and over 10 000 deaths. The large number of cases and the high mortality rate, combined with the lack of effective Food and Drug Administration\u2010approved treatments, necessitate the development of potent and safe therapeutic measures to combat the current and future outbreaks. Since the beginning of the outbreak, there have been considerable efforts to develop and characterize protective measures including vaccines and antiviral small molecules, and some have proven effective in vitro and in animal models. Most recently, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be highly effective in protecting non\u2010human primates from Ebola virus infection. In this review, we will discuss what is known about the nature of the virus, phylogenetic classification, genomic organization and replication, disease transmission, and viral entry and highlight the current approaches and efforts, in the development of therapeutics, to control the outbreak.

Understanding the prognostic value of microbes identified from the upper respiratory tract (a convenient sampling site) is a necessary first step to understand potential for upper respiratory tract POCTs in assisting antimicrobial treatment decisions for respiratory infections (RTIs). The aim was to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract microbial detection and disease prognosis, including effects of antimicrobial use. Methods Data sources were the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Study eligibility criteria consisted of quantitative studies reporting microbiological and prognostic data from patients of all age groups presenting with RTI. Patients presenting to healthcare or research settings with RTI participated. Interventions included upper respiratory tract swab. The methods used were systematic review and meta-analysis. Results Searches identified 5156 articles, of which 754 were duplicates and 4258 excluded on title or abstract. A total of 144 full texts were screened; 21 articles were retained. Studies reported data for 15 microbes and 26 prognostic measures (390 potential associations). One hundred and seven (27%) associations were investigated statistically, of which 38 (36%) were significant. Most studies reported only prognostic value of test positive results. Meta-analyses suggested hospitalization duration was longer for patients with respiratory syncytial virus than adenovirus and influenza, but significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. Conclusions A quarter of potential prognostic associations have been investigated. Of these, a third were significant, suggesting considerable potential for POCT. Future research should investigate prognostic value of positive and negative tests, and interactions between test results, use of antimicrobials and microbial resistance.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thornton, H.

To investigate whether leukocytes could participate in respiratory pathologies and serve as vector for viral spread towards other tissues, the susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection was investigated. Human primary monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection, but strongly restricted HCoV-OC43 replication. Moreover, productive HCoV-229E infection of primary monocytes and of the THP-1 monocytic cell line led to their activation, as indicated by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03B1, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and MMP-9. Moreover, an in vitro chemotaxis assay showed that motility towards chemokines of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was increased following an acute or persistent HCoV-229E infection. Taken together, these results suggest that infected monocytes could serve as a reservoir for HCoV-229E, become activated, participate in the exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, as well as serve as potential vectors for viral dissemination to host tissues, where it could be associated with other pathologies.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desforges, Marc; Miletti, Tina C.; Gagnon, Myl\u00E8ne; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d06658a860cee0b70436f5fab18b50b6ac055af2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114174.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207002304; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207002304","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 infection","persistent HCoV","productive HCoV","E infection of primary monocytes","Human primary monocytes","restricted HCoV-OC43 replication","respiratory pathologies","infected monocytes","tissues","exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies","Abstract Human coronaviruses","susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines","chemokines of THP","viral dissemination","viral spread","respiratory pathogens","monocytic cell line","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","TNF-\u03B1","PBMC","CCL5","CXCL10","central nervous system","macrophages","production of pro-inflammatory mediators","CXCL11","CNS","diseases","motility","activation","reservoir","potential vectors","chemotaxis assay","MMP","results","leukocytes"],"language":"en"},

Sources A search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases, between the years 2002 and 2013, using the following descriptors: asthma exacerbation, virus, child, and acute respiratory infection. Summary of the findings A total of 42 original articles addressing the identification of respiratory viruses during episodes of asthma exacerbation were selected, mostly cross-sectional studies. There was a wide variation in the methodology of the assessed studies, particularly in relation to the children\u0027s age and methods of collection and viral detection. The results indicate that, in up to 92.2% of exacerbations, a viral agent was potentially the main triggering factor, and human rhinovirus was the most frequently identified factor. The pattern of viral circulation may have been responsible for the seasonality of exacerbations. The association between viral infections and allergic inflammation appears to be crucial for the clinical and functional uncontrolled asthma, but few studies have evaluated other triggering factors in association with viral infection. Conclusions Respiratory viruses are present in the majority of asthmatic children during episodes of exacerbation. The involved physiopathological mechanisms are yet to be fully established, and the synergism between allergic inflammation and viral infection appears to determine uncontrolled disease. The role of other triggering and protective agents is yet to be clearly determined.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa, Lusmaia D.C.; Costa, Paulo Sucasas; Camargos, Paulo A.M.","journal":"Jornal de Pediatria","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/189ca97d6dd53f713fe6d3e697addb05cdec828e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094671.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021755714001235; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2014.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021755714001235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261603/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral detection","viral agent","viral infections","acute viral respiratory tract infection","acute respiratory infection","association","episodes of asthma exacerbation","pattern of viral circulation","identification of respiratory viruses","Conclusions Respiratory viruses","onset of asthma exacerbations","episodes of exacerbation","functional uncontrolled asthma","prevalent viruses","triggering factors","main triggering factor","allergic inflammation","detection methods","assessed studies","cross-sectional studies","seasonality of exacerbations","methods of collection","uncontrolled disease","identified factor","original articles","human rhinovirus","available literature","majority of asthmatic children","PubMed","relation","children\u0027s age","SciELO databases","Lilacs","findings","total","methodology","preventive","following descriptors","synergism","search","Abstract Objective","role","protective agents","wide variation","involved physiopathological mechanisms","therapeutic aspects","Sources","years","Summary","results"],"language":"en"},

We therefore investigated the impact of L-SIGN neck region length variation on the outcome of HCV infection. We studied 322 subjects, 150 patients with persistent HCV infection, 63 individuals with spontaneous clearance and 109 healthy controls. In healthy subjects, we found a total of nine genotypes, with the 7/7 genotype being the most frequent (33%) followed by the 7/6 (22.9%) and the 7/5 (18.3%). The frequencies of the alleles were as follows: 7-LSIGN (56.4%), 6-LSIGN (20.2%), 5-L-SIGN (18.3%) and 4-L-SIGN (5%).

All isolates exhibited lower susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1\u20132\u03BCg/mL). Factors associated with mortality included severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia. A detrimental effect of elevated MIC could not be demonstrated despite applying several definitions of patient outcome. Patients admitted to the ED with MRSA bacteraemia carry high overall mortality; however, the severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia are correlated with mortality, but not vancomycin MICs (2\u03BCg/mL) of MRSA isolates.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Chun-Hsing; Chen, Shey-Ying; Huang, Yu-Tsung; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/260a4a6c86be9a90a06b3c6505ac78951ea16045.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127075.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857908001957; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.04.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857908001957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["MRSA","MIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of bacteraemia","persistent bacteraemia","primary bacteraemia","Healthcare-associated MRSA bacteraemia","Catheter-related bacteraemia","hospital mortality","consecutive patients","MRSA isolates","number of patients","severity of underlying illness","high overall mortality","different outcome","Different types of infection","\u03BCg","common type of infection","soft tissue infection","definitions of patient outcome","vancomycin MICs","university hospital","detrimental effect of elevated MIC","minimum inhibitory concentration","lower susceptibility","meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","Emergency Department","fatal disease","clinical characteristics","days","average age","years","Factors","studies","cases"],"language":"en"},

Here, we isolate one BPIV3 strain (named BPIV3 BJ) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from nasal samples collected in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolate is related to BPIV3 of the genotype A. The comparison of BPIV3-BJ and the reference Chinese isolate NM09 showed that these strains are highly divergent. We found many differences in the amino acid composition in the nucleocapsid (NP) protein among these genotype A strains. Since the NP protein has been implicated in immunization studies, our BPIV3 isolate will be useful for the development of immune assays and vaccine studies. The diversity of BPIV3 lineages that we found in China indicated ongoing evolution for immune escape.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P\u003C0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P\u003C0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (\u003C39.1 \u00B0C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Yu-Huan; Dong, Jing-Hui; An, Wei-Min; Lv, Xiao-Yan; Yin, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Zeng; Dong, Li; Ma, Xi; Zhang, Hong-Jie; Gao, Bu-Lang","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c1d608959033784b3e85e34a9209ba77492f5c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102535.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109443/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","Mild patients","common patients","imaging findings of patients","CT imaging presentations of NCP","lower lobe","right upper lobe","treatment of NCP","middle lobe","imaging data","years","chest CT scanning","types of NCP","mild type","imaging characteristics of computed tomography","pleura","partial consolidation","cases","density of lesion","ground glass opacity","patchy ground glass opacities","peripheral areas","novel coronavirus pneumonia","increased C-reactive protein","primary presentation","early diagnosis","important bases","possible extension","moderate fever","COVID","retrospective analysis","disease onset","CONCLUSION","reduced leukocyte count","pulmonary hilum","MATERIALS","METHODS","fibrosis","SARS-CoV","formation of fibrotic stripes","Symmetrical lesions","RESULTS","counts of lymphocytes","PURPOSE","rest"],"language":"en"},

These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens. Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA\u2010templated manner. These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families. During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins. Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA. High\u2010resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms. Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at preventing and treating RNA virus\u2010induced diseases.

Calves (n = 10) presented mild to moderate signs of respiratory disease. Secondary bacterial infections, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma dispar as major species, were detected in tracheobronchial lavage samples. Concentrations of SAA and LBP increased at week 1 had the highest values at week 3 and decreased at week 4 of outbreak. Some calves had high Hp concentrations at week 3, but AGP concentrations did not rise during respiratory disease. Higher SAA, LBP and Hp concentrations at a later stage of BRD (week 3) were associated with the low BRSV-specific IgG(1) production, suggesting that these calves had enhanced inflammatory response to the secondary bacterial infection. In conclusion, APPs (especially SAA and LBP) are sensitive markers of respiratory infection, and they may be useful to explore host response to the respiratory infections in clinical research.","publish_time":"2009-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Orro, Toomas; Pohjanvirta, Tarja; Rikula, Ulla; Huovilainen, Anita; Alasuutari, Sakari; Sihvonen, Liisa; Pelkonen, Sinikka; Soveri, Timo","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6ca2dd418bf7d9a1d5e5d18e31f0213b3df68cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124580.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957109000575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2009.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957109000575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA","AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["week","respiratory infections","LBP","Concentrations of SAA","outbreak of bovine respiratory disease","AGP concentrations","Calves","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","sensitive markers of respiratory infection","moderate signs of respiratory disease","high Hp concentrations","Higher SAA","APPs","inflammatory response","Secondary bacterial infections","inflammatory markers","Bovine acute phase proteins","host response","later stage of BRD","low BRSV-specific IgG","Pasteurella multocida","Mycoplasma dispar","major species","lipopolysaccharide binding protein","serum amyloid","alpha","haptoglobin","clinical research","tracheobronchial lavage samples","acid glycoprotein","production","highest values","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we report on the antiviral evaluation of ferruginol (1) and several analogues synthesized from commercial (\u002B)-dehydroabietylamine. Thus, the activity against Human Herpesvirus type 1, Human Herpesvirus type 2 and Dengue Virus type 2, was studied. Two ferruginol analogues showed high antiviral selectivity index and reduced viral plaque-size in post-infection stages against both Herpes and Dengue viruses. A promising lead, compound 8, was ten-fold more potent (EC50 = 1.4 \u03BCM) than the control ribavirin against Dengue Virus type 2. Our findings suggest that the 12-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene skeleton, which is characteristic of the diterpenoid ferruginol (1), is an interesting molecular scaffold for development of novel antivirals. In addition, the cytotoxic and antifungal activities of the synthesized ferruginol analogues have also been investigated. \u00A920155 Elsevier Science.

Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) coupled with bio-mass spectrometry (MS) is playing important roles in proteome research due to its high speed, high resolution and high sensitivity. Proteome analysis strategies mainly include bottom-up and top-down approaches which carry out biological sample separation based on peptide and protein levels, respectively. Electrophoretic methods combined with liquid chromatography like IEF-HPLC and HPLC-SDS-PAGE have been successful applied for protein separations. As for MDLC strategy, ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) together with reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is still a most widely used chromatography in proteome analysis, other chromatographic methods are also frequently used in protein pre-fractionations, while affinity chromatography is usually adopted for specific functional protein analysis. Recent MDLC technologies and applications to variety of proteome analysis have been achieved great development. A digest peptide-based approach as so-called \u201Cbottom-up\u201D and intact protein-based approach \u201Ctop-down\u201D analysis of proteome samples were briefly reviewed in this paper. The diversity of combinations of different chromatography modes to set up MDLC systems was demonstrated and discussed. Novel developments of MDLC techniques such as high-abundance protein depletion and chromatography array were also included in this review.","publish_time":"2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Jia; Gao, Mingxia; Deng, Chunhui; Zhang, Xiangming","journal":"J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86ffe294d87af020be0c7c23e182f9df6ed9efb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185551.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2008.01.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570023208000664; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023208000664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18289947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chromatography array","affinity chromatography","Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography","different chromatography modes","ion-exchange chromatography","variety of proteome analysis","analysis of proteome samples","Proteome analysis strategies","multi-dimensional chromatography separation methods","reversed phase liquid chromatography","protein separations","protein levels","specific functional protein analysis","intact protein-based approach","high-abundance protein depletion","MDLC strategy","MDLC systems","proteome research","protein pre-fractionations","high speed","high resolution","high sensitivity","Recent MDLC technologies","digest peptide-based approach","complementary approach","Novel developments of MDLC techniques","biological sample separation","chromatographic methods","Electrophoretic methods","D-PAGE","HPLC-SDS","IEF-HPLC","kinds of biological sample investigations","two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","IEX","applications","important roles","bio-mass spectrometry","diversity of combinations","RPLC","approaches","great development","paper","review"],"language":"en"},

An IL-12 expression vector (IL-12DNA) encoding single-chain IL-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB in the lung) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. All monkeys in the control group (saline) died within 8 months, while 50% of monkeys in the HSP65\u002BhIL-12/HVJ group survived more than 14 months post-infection (the termination period of the experiment).

Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.

The manufacturers of the respirators also recommend performing a self-reported user-seal-check to detect for leakage. This study aims to investigate the capability of the user-seal-check in determining the fit of N95 respirators by investigating the sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check compared with QNFT. A prospective and cross-sectional research design was used. A total of 204 local Chinese undergraduate nursing students were recruited to test two commonly used respirator models (3M 1860S and 3M 1862). The results of the user-seal-check were compared with the results of the gold standard QNFT using the Condensation Nucleus Counter Fit Tester System. The sensitivity and specificity of the user-seal-check results obtained with the respirators were calculated. The results indicated low sensitivity, accuracy and predictive value of the user-seal-check in determining the fit of the N95 respirators. The user-seal-check was not found to be reliable as a substitute for QNFT. The results also suggested that the user-seal-check may be unreliable for detecting gross leakage.

By comparing the results with the data of SARS in Singapore 2003, we conclude that the latter model can explain the observation.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujie, Ryo; Odagaki, Takashi","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4a89e03d02e9f212d2bb8d1b77f94ff85fce7f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127014.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437106008703; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2006.08.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288078/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106008703","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standard SIR model","propagation speed","propagation path","density of superspreaders","distribution of secondary infected","epidemic curve","functions of population","spatial structure","percolation probability","data of SARS","Monte Carlo simulation","models","Abstract","strong infectiousness","results","Singapore","social connections","observation"],"language":"en"},

Three NcPROF constructs were investigated, native NcPROF fused with an N-terminal PA tag (PA-NcPROF), PA-NcPROF fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF), and bx-PA-NcPROF with additional C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM). All recombinant proteins were observed extra- and intracellularly in cultured Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was partly abnormally secreted, even though it has the transmembrane domain, and only it was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, but PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. Additionally, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified from silkworm hemolymph by anti-PA agarose beads while PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. The purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein bound to its receptor, mouse Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR-11), and formed unique nanoparticles. These results suggest that profilin fused with GP64TM was secreted as a nanoparticle with binding affinity to its receptor and this nanoparticle formation is advantageous for the development of vaccines to N. caninum.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suhaimi, Hamizah; Hiramatsu, Rikito; Xu, Jian; Kato, Tatsuya; Park, Enoch Y.","journal":"Nanomaterials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50f9ea2210efc3c98630da060b4254036f83c516.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6523865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974883/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano9040593","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. mori"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PA-NcPROF","purified bx-PA","native NcPROF","NcPROF constructs","NcPROF-GP64TM protein","N-terminal PA tag","anti-PA agarose beads","receptor","silkworm larvae","silkworm hemolymph","caninum profilin","BmNPV","Neospora caninum","recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus","additional C-terminal transmembrane","nanoparticle formation","recombinant proteins","transmembrane domain","cytoplasmic domains of GP64","transplacental","abortion","pregnant cattle lead","well-known disease","cultured Bm5 cells","signal sequence of bombyxin","mother","Infections","development of vaccines","mouse Toll","binding affinity","fetus","veterinary field","transmission","TLR","study","results","ultracentrifugation","unique nanoparticles","Neosporosis"],"language":"en"},

The functional phenotypes of T cells and monocytes, as well as serum cytokine levels, were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There were 19 patients (70.4%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 13 (48.1%) with secondary respiratory infection, 20 (74%) with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; defined as having at least two concurrent SIRS components), 18 (66.7%) with lymphocytopenia and 11 (40.7%) with reduced numbers of monocytes. In comparison with levels in the HCs, the levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-10 and the percentages of CD38\u002B or Tim-3\u002B T cells were significantly increased.

Although endogenous mRNA is also 5\u2032-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5\u2032-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide (N(1)) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N(1)-2\u2032O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N(1)-2\u2032O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N(1)-2\u2032O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2\u2032O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I.

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy control subjects (N = 93) and asthmatic children of varying disease severity (N = 66) were characterized by multi-parameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that children with asthma had a significantly increased frequency of Treg cells compared to children without asthma. Using a multivariate model, increased Treg cell frequency in children with asthma was most directly associated with inhaled corticosteroid use, and not asthma severity, allergic sensitization, or atopic status of the asthma. CONCLUSION: We conclude that low dose, local airway administration of corticosteroids is sufficient to impact the frequency of Treg cells in the peripheral blood.

PA has the ability to alter host genome to facilitate its invasion, thus increasing the virulence of the organism. Sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, is known to play a key role in facilitating infection. Sphingosine kinases (SPHK) 1\u00262 phosphorylate sphingosine to generate S1P in mammalian cells. We reported earlier that Sphk2(\u2212/\u2212) mice offered significant protection against lung inflammation, compared to wild type (WT) animals. Therefore, we profiled the differential expression of genes between the protected group of Sphk2(\u2212/\u2212) and the wild type controls to better understand the underlying protective mechanisms related to the Sphk2 deletion in lung inflammatory injury. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on mouse lung tissue using NextSeq 500 sequencing system. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes following PA infection were identified using whole transcriptome of Sphk2(\u2212/\u2212) mice and their WT counterparts. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses of the RNA seq data identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a crucial role in pneumonia caused by PA such as those involved in: 1. Immune response to PA infection and NF-\u03BAB signal transduction; 2. PKC signal transduction; 3. Impact on epigenetic regulation; 4. Epithelial sodium channel pathway; 5. Mucin expression; and 6. Bacterial infection related pathways. Our genomic data suggests a potential role for SPHK2 in PA-induced pneumonia through elevated expression of inflammatory genes in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 10 differentially expressed genes showed 100% concordance in terms of vectoral changes as well as significant fold change. CONCLUSION: Using Sphk2(\u2212/\u2212) mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SPHK2 signaling could play a key role in promoting PA pneumonia.

Since CMt has been detected in the saliva of infected cats using PCR, we hypothesised that direct transmission via social or aggressive contact may occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate this transmission route. CMt-positive saliva and blood samples were obtained from three prednisolone-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were infected intraperitoneally with CMt. Five SPF cats were inoculated with CMt-positive saliva or blood subcutaneously to mimic cat bites, and five cats were inoculated orally with blood or oronasally with saliva to mimic social contact. Blood samples were monitored for CMt infection using quantitative real-time PCR and for seroconversion using a novel western blot assay. Neither oronasal nor subcutaneous inoculation with CMt-positive saliva led to CMt infection in the recipient cats, as determined by PCR, independent of prior prednisolone treatment. However, when blood containing the same CMt dose was given subcutaneously, 4 of the 5 cats became PCR-positive, while none of the 5 cats inoculated orally with up to 500 \u03BCL of CMt-positive blood became PCR-positive. Subsequently, the latter cats were successfully subcutaneously infected with blood. All 13 CMt-exposed cats seroconverted. In conclusion, CMt transmission by social contact seems less likely than transmission by aggressive interaction. The latter transmission may occur if the recipient cat is exposed to blood from an infected cat.","publish_time":"2009-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Museux, Kristina; Boretti, Felicitas S.; Willi, Barbara; Riond, Barbara; Hoelzle, Katharina; Hoelzle, Ludwig E.; Wittenbrink, Max M.; Tasker, S\u00E9verine; Wengi, Nicole; Reusch, Claudia E.; Lutz, Hans; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7af37cc39c5f2eeb88b98ea439da7fc687eddb60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2701178.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1051/vetres/2009028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMt transmission","CMt-positive saliva","CMt-exposed cats","CMt infection","positive blood","\u03BCL of CMt","CMt dose","saliva of infected cats","PCR-positive","recipient cats","SPF cats","blood samples","direct transmission","social contact","natural transmission routes","aggressive contact","quantitative real-time PCR","Mycoplasma haemofelis","Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum","Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis","cat bites","aggressive interaction","independent of prior prednisolone treatment","seroconversion","feline haemotropic mycoplasmas","subcutaneous inoculation","specific pathogen-free","novel western blot assay","conclusion","study","oronasal","aim"],"language":"en"},

We describe the clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of a subgroup of adults with central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by GBS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The database of the Singapore Neurologic Infections Program (SNIP), a national multicenter study for surveillance of infectious neurologic disease, was reviewed to select patients with GBS CNS infection during the outbreak. Cases were diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and identification or isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae in the blood or CSF. Demographic, clinical and neuroradiological information was obtained prospectively and retrospectively abstracted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6 male, 8 female; median age, 58 years) presented with fever, meningism, headache, encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and/or seizures. All except two were previously healthy. Diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) on admission was abnormal in 13 patients, showing tiny hyperintensities in the subarachnoid space (7 patients), ventricles (6 patients) and brain parenchyma (8 patients); 5 patients had cerebellar abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Among healthy non\u2010pregnant adults infected with Serotype III, multilocus sequence type 283 GBS meningitis linked to eating infected raw freshwater fish, DWI detected small pus collections and unusual cerebellar involvement.

Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results. This finding may be of significance to the control of recurrent epidemics.","publish_time":"2015-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Muhua; Wang, Chaoqing; Zhou, Jie; Zhao, Ming; Guan, Shuguang; Zou, Yong; Liu, Zonghua","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/243532558bf1aeed5200836620159cf37f91ab26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4629194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26521709/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep16010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recurrent outbreaks of epidemic","non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics","study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks","non-periodicity","recurrent epidemic patterns","non-annual behaviors","seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza","control of recurrent epidemics","network model of SIRS epidemic","small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds","time-dependent infection rate","main features of real influenza data","large number of real data","numerical simulations","numerical results","larger annual variation of environment","influences","great attention","different cities","decades","significance","necessary conditions","underlying mechanism","Markov dynamics","theoretical analysis","density of susceptible agents","debate","finding","nature"],"language":"en"},

For half a century scientists have pursued the hypothesis that these diseases involve a chronic viral infection in the brain. However, efforts to consistently detect a specific virus in brains of patients with such diseases as Alzheimer\u2019s or multiple sclerosis have generally failed. Neuropathologists have become increasingly aware that most patients with neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate marked deterioration of the brain olfactory bulb in addition to brain targets that define the specific disease. In fact, the loss of the sense of smell may precede overt neurological symptoms by many years. This realization that the olfactory bulb is a common target in neurodegenerative diseases suggests the possibility that microbes and/or toxins in inhaled air may play a role in their pathogenesis. With regard to inhaled viruses, neuropathologists have focused on those viruses that infect and kill neurons. However, a recent study shows that a respiratory virus with no neurotropic properties can rapidly invade the mouse olfactory bulb from the nasal cavity. Available data suggest that this strain of influenza is passively transported to the bulb via the olfactory nerves (mechanism unknown), and is taken up by glial cells in the outer layers of the bulb. The infected glial cells appear to be activated by the virus, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and block further spread of virus within the brain. At the time that influenza symptoms become apparent (15h post-infection), but not prior to symptom onset (10h post-infection), proinflammatory cytokine-expressing neurons are increased in olfactory cortical pathways and hypothalamus as well as in the olfactory bulb. The mice go on to die of pneumonitis with severe acute phase and respiratory disease symptoms but no classical neurological symptoms. While much remains to be learned about this intranasal influenza-brain invasion model, it suggests the hypothesis that common viruses encountered in our daily life may initiate neuroinflammation via olfactory neural networks. The numerous viruses that we inhale during a lifetime might cause the death of only a few neurons per infection, but this minor damage would accumulate over time and contribute to age-related brain shrinkage and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Elderly individuals with a strong innate inflammatory system, or ongoing systemic inflammation (or both), might be most susceptible to these outcomes. The evidence for the hypothesis that common respiratory viruses may contribute to neurodegenerative processes is developed in the accompanying article.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majde, Jeannine A.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/157257619334dee253b18e136d7234e6e871ea9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2897933.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710000885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236772/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710000885","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain olfactory bulb","mouse olfactory bulb","Summary Neurodegenerative diseases","olfactory nerves","common viruses","common respiratory viruses","brain targets","influenza symptoms","inhaled viruses","respiratory disease symptoms","neurodegenerative processes","olfactory cortical pathways","olfactory neural networks","hypothesis","specific virus","neurons","numerous viruses","h post-infection","age-related brain shrinkage","intranasal influenza-brain invasion model","overt neurological symptoms","classical neurological symptoms","common target","chronic viral infection","specific disease","strain of influenza","Neuropathologists","infected glial cells","brains of patients","proinflammatory cytokines","inhaled air","strong innate inflammatory system","marked deterioration","severe acute phase","horrendous burden","daily life","ongoing systemic inflammation","pneumonitis","sense of smell","neuroinflammation","possibility","microbes","addition","Elderly individuals","neurotropic properties","symptom onset","victims","toxins","Alzheimer\u2019s","outer layers","nasal cavity","hypothalamus","mechanism unknown","minor damage","loss","families","role","multiple sclerosis","block","years","death","recent study","regard","evidence","Available data","accompanying article","society","century scientists","lifetime","efforts","realization","outcomes","pathogenesis","mice","remains"],"language":"en"},

Early diagnosis and treatment of viral infections continue to be of paramount importance in immunocompromised patients; because once viral replication and invasive infections are evident, prognosis can be grave. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main antiviral agents used for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients and review of the new agents in the pipeline. Expert commentary: Over the past decade, important diagnostic advances, specifically, the use of rapid molecular testing has helped close the gap between clinical scenarios and pathogen identification and enhanced early diagnosis of viral infections and understanding of the role of prolonged shedding and viral loads. Advancements in novel antiviral therapeutics with high resistance thresholds and effective immunization for preventable infections in immunocompromised patients are needed.","publish_time":"2017-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahani, Lokesh; Ariza-Heredia, Ella J.; Chemaly, Roy F.","journal":"Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dba329819f979d241de14e981ca36a3f28ae7da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103713.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2017.1279970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of viral infections","immunocompromised patients","treatment of respiratory viral infections","early diagnosis of viral infections","preventable infections","invasive infections","common causes of respiratory viral infections","viral replication","viral loads","Respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","review","main antiviral agents","new agents","novel antiviral therapeutics","high resistance thresholds","effective immunization","coronavirus","parainfluenza","pathogen identification","past decade","gap","human metapneumovirus","rhinovirus","important diagnostic advances","role of prolonged shedding","clinical scenarios","paramount importance","use of rapid molecular testing","Advancements","prognosis","overview","Expert commentary","Introduction","general population","purpose","pipeline","Areas"],"language":"en"},

While the majority of EAV infections are asymptomatic, acutely infected animals may develop a wide range of clinical signs, including pyrexia, limb and ventral edema, depression, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. The virus may cause abortion and has caused mortality in neonates. After natural EAV infection, most horses develop a solid, long-term immunity to the disease. Marzz and geldings eliminate the virus within 60 days, but 30 to 60% of acutely infected stallions will become persistently infected. These persistently infected animals maintain EAV within the reproductive tract, shed virus continuously in the semen, and can transmit the virus venereally. Mares infected venereally may not have clinical signs, but they shed large amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal secretions and in urine, which may result in lateral spread of the infection by an aerosol route. The consequences of venereally acquired infection are minimal, with no known effects on conception rate, but mares infected at a late stages of gestation may abort. Identification of carrier stallions is crucial to control the dissemination of EAV. The stallions can be identified by serological screening using a virus neutralization (VN) test. If positive at a titer of \u2265 1:4, the stallion should be tested for persistent infection by virus isolation from the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate, or by test mating Shedding stallions should not be used for breeding, or should be bred only to mares seropositive from a natural infection or from vaccination, the mares should be subsequently isolated from seronegative horses for three weeks after natural or artificial insemination. A live attenuated (ARVAC) and a formalin-inactivated (ARTERVAC) vaccine are available. Both vaccines induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, the presence of which correlates with protection from disease, abortion, and the development of a persistent infection. Serological investigations indicate that EAV has a worldwide distribution and that its prevalence is increasing. As a consequence, an increasing number of equine viral arteritis (EVA) outbreaks is being reported. This trend is likely to continue unless action is taken to slow or halt the transmission of this agent through semen.","publish_time":"1997-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glaser, A. L.; Chirnside, E.

A number of inhibitors targeting this protein have been developed in the past several years. Recently, a group of small molecules were identified to have inhibitory activity against cathepsin B through high throughput screening (HTS) tests. In this study, traditional continuous and binary QSAR models were built to classify the biological activities of previously identified compounds and to distinguish active compounds from inactive compounds for drug development based on the calculated molecular and physicochemical properties. Strong correlations were obtained for the continuous QSAR models with regression correlation coefficients (r(2)) and cross-validated correlation coefficients (q(2)) of 0.77 and 0.61 for all compounds, and 0.82 and 0.68 for the compound set excluding 3 outliers, respectively. The models were further validated through the leave-one-out (LOO) method and the training-test set method. The binary models demonstrated a strong level of predictability in distinguishing the active compounds from inactive compounds with accuracies of 0.89 and 0.94 for active and inactive compounds, respectively, in non-cross-validated models. Similar results were obtained for the cross-validated models. Collectively, these results demonstrate the models\u2019 ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds, suggesting that the models may be used to pre-screen compounds to facilitate compound optimization and to design novel inhibitors for drug development.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Zhigang; Wang, Yanli; Bryant, Stephen H.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26cb9fe2c446b0325e4c5ccffe30e1483f89d39d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/225102534f103300288d0a6e271b5d12c29720ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2873115.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326310000215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326310000215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194042/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2873115?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2010.01.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin"],"organizations":["QSAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactive compounds","identified compounds","binary models","non-cross-validated models","continuous QSAR models","binary QSAR models","cross-validated correlation coefficients","drug development","Cathepsin B","development of drugs","compound set","regression correlation coefficients","novel inhibitors","training-test set method","compound optimization","number of inhibitors","Strong correlations","Similar results","strong level of predictability","high throughput screening","inhibitory activity","HTS","potential target","accuracies","tests","study","models\u2019 ability","important human diseases","biological activities","group of small molecules","physicochemical properties","protein","LOO","past","outliers","leave","years"],"language":"en"},

Airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria could be a potential health crisis as reserve of antibiotic resistance transmission in environment. The composition and antibiotic resistance pattern of culturable bacterial community and how these are affected by air pollution remain unclear. Objectives This study aimed to compare the compositions and antibiotic resistance patterns of culturable bacteria in polluted and non-polluted weather conditions in Beijing. Methods Air samples were collected indoors and outdoors during polluted and non-polluted weather using six-stage Andersen Samplers. For each isolated bacterium, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, sequenced, and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database Antibiotic resistance was conducted by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results Bacterial concentration in polluted weather was significantly higher than in non-polluted weather, both indoors and outdoors (P \u003C 0.05). Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were dominant in both weathers but gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were more abundant in polluted weather than non-polluted weather both indoors and outdoors. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria occupied 23.7% of all bacterial isolates, 22.4% of isolates from polluted weather and 27.8% of isolates from non-polluted weather. Penicillins were resisted by 72.4% and 83.3% of isolates from polluted and non-polluted weather, respectively. Conclusions The bacterial concentration was significantly higher in polluted weather, compared to non-polluted weather. Polluted weather is correlated with changes in the bacterial composition in the air, with a greater abundance of GNB. Penicillins was resisted by over 70% of bacterial isolates. The abundance of MDR bacteria suggested potential risks for human health.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Yixin; Ding, Pei; Wang, Youbin; Ding, Cheng; Wu, Liping; Zheng, Ping; Zhang, Xiao; Li, Xia; Wang, Leyao; Sun, Zongke","journal":"Environment International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdebb2b0f78abab06a7b1843831fdaa78c3463f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284114/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412019303393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019303393; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.104936","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Penicillins"],"organizations":["Background Air","Methods Air","National Center for Biotechnology Information","GNB","MDR"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["non-polluted weather conditions","bacterial isolates","Bacterial concentration","bacterial composition","antibiotic resistance patterns of culturable bacteria","gram-negative bacteria","Airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria","Gram-positive bacteria","abundance of MDR bacteria","antibiotic resistance pattern of culturable bacterial community","reserve of antibiotic resistance transmission","Biotechnology Information database Antibiotic resistance","potential health crisis","human health","Beijing","Abstract Background Air pollution","Methods Air samples","Penicillins","serious health issue","greater abundance of GNB","potential risks","Multidrug-resistant","National Center","weathers","compositions","S ribosomal RNA gene","GPB","years","antimicrobial susceptibility testing","environment","stage Andersen Samplers","changes","isolated bacterium","Conclusions","study","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin II, the primary bioactive peptide of the RAS, is generated from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). A homologue of ACE, ACE2, is able to convert angiotensin II to a peptide with opposing effects, angiotensin-(1-7). It is proposed that disturbance of the balance of ACE and ACE2 expression and/or function is important in pathologies in which angiotensin II plays a role. These include cardiovascular and renal disease, lung injury and liver fibrosis. The critical roles of ACE and ACE2 in regulating angiotensin II levels have traditionally focussed attention on their activities as angiotensinases. Recent discoveries, however, have illuminated the roles of these enzymes and of the ACE2 homologue, collectrin, in intracellular trafficking and signalling.

The N-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of CML, DNVKYSGQVKNTGSA, has not been reported for other lectins. Also, the peptide mass fingerprinting assay confirmed that there is no match result of similar plant lectins for CML, indicating CML may be a novel plant lectin. CML showed marked antiviral activity against various viruses in cell culture. Subsequently, CML was also found to exhibit remarkable inhibitory effect on L929, HeLa, MCF7 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, CML specially induced L929 cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner as evidenced by MTT, fluorescent microscopy, LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays and DNA ladder. Moreover, due to both caspase inhibitors and Western blot analyses, caspase was also found to play the important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of CML. When the carbohydrate-binding site was fully inhibited by sugars, cytotoxicity was abruptly decreased and apoptotic phenomenon in L929 cells was not observed, suggesting a significant correlation between mannose-binding-specific activity and the antineoplastic mechanism.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Hao; Lv, Hui; Wang, Ying; Liu, Yan-hong; Li, Chun-yang; Meng, Liang; Chen, Fang; Bao, Jin-ku","journal":"Peptides","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3178ce8195f3f42963e3bf058ef3932ee9743cb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115534.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019697810900268X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019697810900268X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19577602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CML","Clematis montana Buch.-Ham"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["designated CML","hemagglutinating activity of CML","amino acid sequence of CML","specific activity","L929 cells","novel mannose-binding lectin","montana lectin","novel plant lectin","marked antiviral activity","LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays","induced L929 cell apoptosis","gel filtration chromatographies","potential apoptotic mechanism of","carbohydrate-binding site","cell culture","caspase inhibitors","apoptotic phenomenon","antineoplastic mechanism","HepG2 cells","match result of similar plant lectins","Clematis montana Buch","ion exchange","HeLa","Ham stem","DEAE-Sepharose","various viruses","Ranunculaceae","MTT","dose-dependent manner","fluorescent microscopy","Western blot analyses","MCF7","remarkable inhibitory effect","DNA ladder","important role","homodimer","DNVKYSGQVKNTGSA","N-terminal","Sephacryl S","significant correlation","peptide mass fingerprinting assay","subunits","sugars","branched oligomannosides"],"language":"en"},

Arthritogenic alphavirus infections, as the name implies, are associated with arthritic outcomes while encephalitic alphavirus infections can lead to encephalitic outcomes in the infected host. Of the non-structural proteins (nsPs) that the viruses code for, nsP3 is the least understood in terms of function. Alphavirus nsP3s are characterized by regions with significantly conserved domain structure along with regions of high variability. Interactions of nsP3 with several host proteins have been documented including, stress granule-related proteins, dead box proteins, heat shock proteins, and kinases. In some cases, in addition to the interaction, requirement of the interaction to support infection has been demonstrated. An understanding of the proteomic network of nsP3 and the mechanisms by which these interactions support the establishment of a productive infection would make alphavirus nsP3 an interesting target for design of effective medical countermeasures.","publish_time":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lark, Tyler; Keck, Forrest; Narayanan, Aarthi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a79847f406c9f694222cc18a1ffd04dbc0c06d08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5767282.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","non-structural proteins","encephalitic alphavirus infections","Interactions of nsP3","Arthritogenic alphavirus infections","encephalitic outcomes","Alphavirus nsP3s","dead box proteins","heat shock proteins","stress granule-related proteins","proteomic network of nsP3","arthritic outcomes","productive infection","infected host","regions of high variability","interesting target","design of effective medical countermeasures","conserved domain structure","nsPs","mechanisms","requirement","Togaviridae family","viruses code","Alphaviruses","members","addition","understanding","establishment","kinases","categories","terms of function","cases"],"language":"en"},

Recently, astroviruses have been reported in bats in many countries, but not Korea. We collected 363 bat samples from thirteen species at twenty-nine sites in Korea across 2016 and tested them for astrovirus. The detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in bat astroviruses was confirmed in thirty-four bats across four bat species in Korea: twenty-five from Miniopterus fuliginosusi, one from Myotis macrodactylus, four from M. petax, and four from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. The highest detection rates for astrovirus were found in Sunchang (61.5%, 8/13 bats), and in the samples collected in April (63.2%, 12/19 bats). The amino acid identity of astroviral sequences identified from bat samples was \u2265 46.6%. More specifically, the amino acid identity within multiple clones from individual bats was \u2265 50.8%. Additionally, the phylogenetic topology between astroviruses from different bat families showed a close relationship. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 sequence of bat astroviruses was found to have a maximum similarity of 73.3\u201374.8% with available bat astrovirus sequences. These results indicate potential multiple-infection by several bat astrovirus species in individual bats, or hyperpolymorphism in the astrovirus strains, as well as the transmission of astroviruses across bat families; furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 implied that a novel astrovirus may exist. However, the wide diversity of astroviral sequences appeared to have no significant correlation with bat species or the spatiotemporal distribution of Korean bat astroviruses.","publish_time":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sook-Young; Son, Ki-Dong; Yong-Sik, Kim; Wang, Seung-Jun; Kim, Yong-Kwan; Jheong, Weon-Hwa; Oem, Jae-Ku","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccbfceafec73ebe32fb12b463a47afe70d688fe6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087088.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097745/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3992-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinolophus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["bat species","bat astrovirus species","bat samples","available bat astrovirus sequences","different bat families","individual bats","partial ORF2 sequence of bat astroviruses","spatiotemporal distribution of Korean bat astroviruses","transmission of astroviruses","astrovirus strains","novel astrovirus","phylogenetic analysis","amino acid identity of astroviral sequences","phylogenetic topology","wide diversity of astroviral sequences","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","multiple clones","potential multiple-infection","highest detection rates","RdRp","significant correlation","hyperpolymorphism","Miniopterus fuliginosusi","petax","Myotis macrodactylus","close relationship","natural reservoir","zoonotic viruses","results","Sunchang","sites","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","countries","maximum similarity"],"language":"en"},

With origins in the bat enteric system, we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) also use bacterial components to modulate infectivity. To test this question, we incubated CoVs with LPS and PG and evaluated infectivity finding no change following LPS treatment. However, PG from B. subtilis reduced infection \u003E10,000-fold while PG from other bacterial species failed to recapitulate this. Treatment with an alcohol solvent transferred inhibitory activity to the wash and mass spectrometry revealed surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as the inhibitory compound. This antibiotic had robust dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that surfactin disrupts CoV virion integrity and surfactin treatment of the virus inoculum ablated infection in vivo. Finally, similar cyclic lipopeptides had no effect on CoV infectivity and the inhibitory effect of surfactin extended broadly to enveloped viruses including influenza, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, Chikungunya, Una, Mayaro, Dugbe, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Overall, our results indicate that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin has broad virucidal activity and suggest bacteria byproducts may negatively modulate virus infection. In this manuscript, we considered a role for bacteria in shaping coronavirus infection. Taking cues from studies of enteric viruses, we initially investigated how bacterial surface components might improve CoV infection. Instead, we found that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin is a potent viricidal compound that disrupts virion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses. Our results indicate that interactions with commensal bacterial may improve or disrupt viral infections highlighting the importance of understanding these microbial interactions and their implications for viral pathogenesis and treatment.","publish_time":"2019-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Bryan A.; Hage, Adam; Kalveram, Birte; Mears, Megan; Plante, Jessica A.; Rodriguez, Sergio E.; Ding, Zhixia; Luo, Xuemei; Bente, Dennis; Bradrick, Shelton S.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Popov, Vsevolod; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Rossi, Shannan; Russell, William K.; Menachery, Vineet D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/635854","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PG"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","surfactin treatment","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","bacterial components","coronavirus infection","PG","CoV virion integrity","inhibitory effect of surfactin","peptidoglycan-associated surfactin","LPS treatment","enveloped viruses","studies of enteric viruses","inhibitory activity","bacterial species","bacterial surface components","temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity","Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV","broad activity","inhibitory compound","evaluated infectivity","virus inoculum ablated infection","broad virucidal activity","results","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses","cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic","bat enteric system","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","bacteria byproducts","viral pathogenesis","microbial interactions","viral infections","Mechanistic studies","potent viricidal compound","similar cyclic lipopeptides","Nipah","Dugbe","Chikungunya","Zika","wash","mass spectrometry","lipopolysaccharides","Mayaro","Una","Ebola","implications","fold","change","robust dose","alcohol solvent","importance","influenza","CoVs","role","origins","subtilis","cues","question","humans","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the importance of the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal.

Molecular docking (MD) was then performed every 10 ns during the MDS course to ensure the binding of small molecules to the polymerase over the entire time of the simulation. MD revealed the binding ability of four suggested guanosine inhibitors (GIs); (Guanosine substituted with OH and SH (phenyl) oxidanyl in the 2\u2032 carbon of the ribose ring). The GIs were compared to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and five anti\u2010hepatitis C virus drugs (either approved or under clinical trials). The mode of binding and the binding performance of GIs to ZIKV polymerase were found to be the same as GTP. Hence, these compounds were capable of competing GTP for the active site.

In the last decade, new marine bioprocess technologies have allowed the isolation of substances with biological properties. The brown alga Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Ochrophyta) was enzymatically hydrolyzed to prepare water-soluble extracts by using six different commercially available carbohydrate-degrading enzymes and two proteases. Evaluation of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant, tyrosinase, elastase, and biofilm inhibition, antibacterial and antiviral activities as well as evaluation of cytotoxicity were realized for each extract. Total phenolic content was measured for extract characterization, and solid-phase extraction was useful to purify the enzymatic extract. Soluble total phenolic content of S. muticum Viscozyme extract was highest with 6.4% of dry weight. Enzymatic Celluclast and Viscozyme extracts had the lowest value of DPPH IC(50) indicating a strong antiradical activity, 0.6 mg mL(\u22121), in comparison with other enzymes. The ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged between 48.7 \u03BCM Fe(2\u002B) Eq, digested with Viscozyme, and 60.8 \u03BCM Fe(2\u002B) Eq, digested with Amyloglucosidase. Tyrosinase inhibition activity of S. muticum Neutrase extract was 41.3% higher compared to other enzymes. Elastase inhibition activity of S. muticum Shearzyme extract had highest activity (32.8%). All enzymatic extracts showed no cytotoxic effect towards the kidney Vero cells. Meanwhile, only S. muticum Neutrase and Alcalase extracts exhibited potential antiviral activity. In addition, S. muticum Viscozyme and Shearzyme extracts showed promising activity in suppressing the biofilm formation against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, respectively. Purification of S. muticum Viscozyme extracts by solid-phase extraction managed to concentrate the phenolic content and improve the bioactivity. These results indicate the promising potential of enzyme-assisted followed by solid-phase extraction in recovering phenolic content and in improving its bioactivity.","publish_time":"2017-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Puspita, Maya; D\u00E9niel, Maureen; Widowati, Ita; Radjasa, Ocky Karna; Douzenel, Philippe; Marty, Christel; Vandanjon, Laurent; Bedoux, Gilles; Bourgougnon, Nathalie","journal":"J Appl Phycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23a43def2952506f8c5e299e5a27918e6c4f9bce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214664/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1086-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sargassum","S. muticum Viscozyme","S. muticum Neutrase"],"organizations":["Fensholt","DPPH IC","Shearzyme"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["muticum Viscozyme extracts","muticum Shearzyme extract","muticum Neutrase extract","enzymatic extracts","Shearzyme extracts","promising activity","highest activity","Elastase inhibition activity","Tyrosinase inhibition activity","Alcalase extracts","water-soluble extracts","extract characterization","potential antiviral activity","solid-phase extraction","enzymes","Soluble total phenolic content","strong antiradical activity","biofilm inhibition","brown alga Sargassum muticum","ferric reducing antioxidant power","\u03BCM Fe","Enzymatic Celluclast","Eq","bioactivity","promising potential of enzyme","biofilm formation","useful leads","antiviral activities","evaluation of cytotoxicity","development of new functional ingredients","new marine bioprocess technologies","lowest value of DPPH IC","Yendo","cytotoxic effect","isolation of substances","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Fensholt","excellent sources of bioactive metabolites","Escherichia coli","cosmetic industries","kidney Vero cells","decade","available carbohydrate","picrylhydrazyl","biological properties","Seaweeds","diphenyl","results","Ochrophyta","addition","Purification","dry weight","proteases","Amyloglucosidase","comparison"],"language":"en"},

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number [Formula: see text]). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high [Formula: see text] , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions.

Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. Methods We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission. Results Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65\u00B113.12 and 67.77\u00B112.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusions We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups. These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Zheyong; Cao, Jiatian; Yao, Yumeng; Jin, Xuejuan; Luo, Zhe; Xue, Yuan; Zhu, Chouwen; Song, Yanan; Wang, Ying; Zou, Yunzeng; Qian, Juying; Yu, Kaihuan; Gong, Hui; Ge, Junbo","journal":"Annals of translational medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395474/; https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.03.229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","BNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blockers-ACEIs","Clinical severity","Group B participants","non-RAS blockers groups","clinical course","severity of COVID","angiotensin receptor blockers","clinical characteristics","hospitalized COVID","hospitalized hypertension patients","clinical severe conditions of COVID","elevated NT-proBNP level","ACE2 level","ARBs","years","significant difference","hospital admission","significant lower level","laboratory","obvious difference","cTnI","hospital mortality","N-terminal","SARS-CoV","Previous experimental data","functional receptor of SARS","used renin-angiotensin system","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","increased risk","basic blood pressure medications","novel coronavirus","Background Coronavirus disease","pre-admission antihypertensive drugs","following treatment","ACE inhibitors","symptoms","pro hormone BNP","short time outcome","chest CT findings","effects","Serum cardiac troponin","statistical significance","males","effective control","concern","current reports","enzyme","Methods","average age","Conclusions","pandemic","Results"],"language":"en"},

Because of the overlap of symptoms of Ebola virus disease and malaria, the care delivery of malaria is particularly sensitive to the indirect effects of the current Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. We therefore characterise malaria case management in the context of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic and document the effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria case management. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of public health facilities in Guinea in December, 2014. We selected the four prefectures most affected by Ebola virus disease and selected four randomly from prefectures without any reported cases of the disease. 60 health facilities were sampled in Ebola-affected and 60 in Ebola-unaffected prefectures. Study teams abstracted malaria case management indicators from registers for January to November for 2013 and 2014 and interviewed health-care workers. Nationwide weekly surveillance data for suspect malaria cases reported between 2011 and 2014 were analysed independently. Data for malaria indicators in 2014 were compared with previous years. FINDINGS: We noted substantial reductions in all-cause outpatient visits (by 23 103 [11%] of 214 899), cases of fever (by 20249 [15%] of 131 330), and patients treated with oral (by 22 655 [24%] of 94 785) and injectable (by 5219 [30%] of 17 684) antimalarial drugs in surveyed health facilities. In Ebola-affected prefectures, 73 of 98 interviewed community health workers were operational (74%, 95% CI 65\u201383) and 35 of 73 were actively treating malaria cases (48%, 36\u201360) compared with 106 of 112 (95%, 89\u201398) and 102 of 106 (96%, 91\u201399), respectively, in Ebola-unaffected prefectures. Nationwide, the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic was estimated to have resulted in 74 000 (71 000\u201377 000) fewer malaria cases seen at health facilities in 2014. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in the delivery of malaria care because of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic threatens malaria control in Guinea. Untreated and inappropriately treated malaria cases lead to excess malaria mortality and more fever cases in the community, impeding the Ebola-virus-disease response.

Sequence analysis of the fusion gene from the isolates revealed two phylogenetic groups with five possible lineages (A1, A2a/A2b, B1, and B2). Among these co-circulating strains, A2 strains were most frequently observed and demonstrated the greatest divergence.

Related clinical features are needed. METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO(2) during admission, cases were divided into the SpO(2)\u226590% group (n=55) and the SpO(2)\u003C90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO(2)\u003C90% group. Compared with SpO(2)\u226590% group, patients of the SpO(2)\u003C90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhongliang; Yang, Bohan; Li, Qianwen; Wen, Lu; Zhang, Ruiguang","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27314482a741e0c2adf4e7ebaeceac5124dd9dfc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176772/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Union"],"keyphrases":["Older patients","enrolled patients","group","mortality rate","lowest SpO","discharging rate","COVID","SARS-CoV","Wuhan","underlying comorbidities","dry cough","frequent fever","antiviral therapy","antibiotic therapy","higher risk of death","higher plasma levels of IL6","serious outbreak of coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","IL10","lactate dehydrogenase","c reactive protein","tendency","median age","inflammatory cytokines","admission","years","IQR","Union hospital","final date of follow-up","Arbidol treatment","Related clinical features","RESULTS","common symptoms","cases","China","CONCLUSIONS","deaths","METHODS","BACKGROUND","fatigue"],"language":"en"},

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighteen male calves 8\u201330 days of age were used to evaluate the efficacy of 3 methods of fluid therapy after induction of osmotic diarrhea and dehydration. The diarrhea and dehydration were induced by administration of saccharose, spironolactone, and hydrochlorothiazide for 48 hours. The animals were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: Group 1: 7.2% hypertonic saline solution\u2010HSS (5 mL/kg IV); Group 2: oral isotonic electrolyte solution IES (60 mL/kg PO); or Group 3: HSS\u002BIES.

Generating feline cells with reduced ability to respond to interferon (IFN) is an essential step facilitating isolation of new candidate vaccine strains. Here, we describe the use of Crispr/Cas technology to disrupt type I IFN signaling in two feline cell lines, AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU, and evaluate the replication kinetics of a serotype I feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) within these cells. We report that polyclonal cell populations and a clonal isolate, termed Fcwf-4 IRN, exhibited significantly diminished IFN-responsiveness and allowed FIPV replication kinetics comparable to parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that replication of FIPV is enhanced by ectopic expression of a host serine protease, TMPRSS2, in these cells. We discuss the potential of these cells for isolating new clinical strains and for propagating candidate vaccine strains of FIPV.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mettelman, Robert C.; O\u0027Brien, Amornrat; Whittaker, Gary R.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daae66becbf5f3477409f82cd5f6bdd6bc05e7f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539770/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219302557; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219302557; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.08.030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Crispr/Cas","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline cells","replication of FIPV","parental cells","feline cell lines","propagating candidate vaccine strains of FIPV","FIPV replication kinetics comparable","feline infectious peritonitis virus","widespread feline disease","isolation of new candidate vaccine strains","new clinical strains","effective vaccine","Abstract Feline coronavirus infection","diminished IFN-responsiveness","fatal infectious peritonitis","termed Fcwf","polyclonal cell populations","clonal isolate","essential step","serotype","ectopic expression","AK-D","host serine protease","Cas technology","IRN","reduced ability","interferon","TMPRSS2","CU","use of Crispr","potential"],"language":"en"},

The level of targeted protein expression and siRNA uptake were examined in A549 cells. CS-modified PLGA NS exhibited much higher encapsulation efficiency than unmodified PLGA NS (plain-PLGA NS).

The efficiencies of different siRNA preparations were compared at the level of targeted protein expression. The gene-silencing efficiency of CS-modified PLGA NS was higher and more prolonged than those of plain-PLGA NS and naked siRNA.

The recent outbreak in Central and South America has resulted in serious illness in some adult patients. We report adult patients in Latin America diagnosed with ZIKAV infection admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs). METHODS: Multicenter, prospective case series of adult patients with laboratory diagnosis of ZIKAV in 16 ICUs in 8 countries. RESULTS: Between December 1st 2015 and April 2nd 2016, 16 ICUs in 8 countries enrolled 49 critically ill patients with diagnosis of ZIKAV infection. We included 10 critically ill patients with ZIKAV infection, as diagnosed with RT-PCR, admitted to the ICU. Neurologic manifestations concordant with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) were present in all patients, although 2 evolved into an encephalitis-like picture. 2 cases died, one due to encephalitis, the other septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Differing from what was usually reported, ZIKAV infection can result in life-threatening neurologic illness in adults, including GBS and encephalitis. Collaborative reporting to identify severe illness from an emerging pathogen can provide valuable insights into disease epidemiology and clinical presentation, and inform public health authorities about acute care priorities.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sebasti\u00E1n, Ugarte Ubiergo; Ricardo, Arenas Villamizar Angel; Alvarez, Bruno C.; Cubides, Angela; Luna, Ang\u00E9lica F.; Arroyo-Parejo, Max; Acu\u00F1a, Cayri E.; Quintero, Agamen\u00F3n V.; Villareal, Orlando Ch.; Pinillos, Oscar S.; Vieda, El\u00EDas; Bello, Manuel; Pe\u00F1a, Susana; Due\u00F1as-Castell, Carmelo; Rodriguez, Gloria M.V.; Ranero, Jorge L.M.; L\u00F3pez, Rosa L.M.; Olaya, Sandra G.; Vergara, Jos\u00E9 C.; Tandazo, Ana; Ospina, Juan P.S.; Leyton Soto, Igor M.; Fowler, R.A.; Marshall, John C.","journal":"J Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/085852bf4b4b2391117ee578fb0e2adfd64ed5bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2017.07.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944117302678; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944117302678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units","ICU","GBS"],"locations":["Latin America","South America"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","diagnosis of ZIKAV infection","laboratory diagnosis of ZIKAV","ICUs","encephalitis","prospective case series of adult patients","life-threatening neurologic illness","severe illness","GBS","serious illness","neurologic complications","countries","Neurologic manifestations concordant","South America","Latin America","acute care priorities","Intensive Care Units","clinical presentation","public health authorities","valuable insights","Guillain-Barre Syndrome","disease epidemiology","emerging pathogen","adults","METHODS","recent outbreak","minor symptoms","Collaborative reporting","RT-PCR","septic shock","Zika virus","picture","cases","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to quantify pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs following infection of canine air-interface tracheal cultures with CRCoV. Within this system, immunohistochemistry identified ciliated epithelial and goblet cells as positive for CRCoV, identical to naturally infected cases, thus the data obtained would be fully transferable to the situation in vivo. An assay of ciliary function was used to assess potential effects of CRCoV on the mucociliary system. CRCoV was shown to reduce the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 and the chemokine IL-8 during the 72h post-inoculation. The mechanism for this is unknown, however the suppression of a key antiviral strategy during a period of physiologic and immunological stress, such as on entry to a kennel, could potentially predispose a dog to further pathogenic challenge and the development of respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Priestnall, Simon L.; Mitchell, Judy A.; Brooks, Harriet W.; Brownlie, Joe; Erles, Kerstin","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6e619c0ffadbef3bb6d0802d9952290f1d6b6f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112596.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.09.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708003577; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708003577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977539/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Canine respiratory coronavirus","potential effects of CRCoV","outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease","host antiviral response","development of respiratory disease","induction of antiviral type","key antiviral strategy","viral infection","pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs","infection of canine air-interface tracheal cultures","chemokine IL","mucociliary system","pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1","innate immune response","goblet cells","period of physiologic","immunohistochemistry","mRNA levels","pathogenic challenge","immunological stress","lines of defence","suppression","interferons","infected cases","CIRD","group","coronaviruses","mechanisms","entry","data","assay of ciliary function","dog","IFNs","study","widespread international presence","h post-inoculation","kennel","situation"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Lower respiratory tract infection is easily suggested on clinical signs (cough and sputum) associated with fever. To discriminate between pneumonia and acute bronchitis is crucial because of the mortality associated with pneumonia and of its specific management. Chest X-ray is a key exam for the diagnosis and should be performed on the basis of validated clinical signs that are however of weak diagnostic value. Clinical as well as radiological signs cannot be reliably used to identify the causative germ. Sputum examination, the search for pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigens are of good diagnostic value. An associated COPD may lead to an acute respiratory failure. Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis results from various causes but infection is involved in about 50% of the cases, mostly viral and most often due to a rhinovirus. Viral infection can be associated to bacterial infection and the most frequently isolated germs are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. Severity assessment relies on the value of basal FEV1 that is often non available. Therefore Afssaps suggests using a dyspnea index to assess exacerbation severity.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Housset, B.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b917e86414e580ebed97a3560e8d41a38c42ce7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130619.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X06001429; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X06001429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Therefore Afssaps"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the value","the basis","the diagnosis","the cases","the mortality associated with pneumonia","Viral infection can be associated to bacterial infection","the search for pneumococcal","Acute exacerbation","infection respiratoire basse","weak diagnostic value","good diagnostic value","the most frequently isolated germs","To discriminate between pneumonia","causes d\u0027exacerbation","Clinical as well as radiological signs cannot be reliably used to identify the causative","acute bronchitis is crucial because","dyspnea index to assess exacerbation severity","associated with fever","An associated COPD may lead to an acute respiratory failure","validated clinical signs that","basal FEV1 that is often","Abstract Lower respiratory tract infection is easily suggested","Chest X-ray is","most often","Streptococcus pneumoniae","signes respiratoires","Haemophilus influenzae","BPCO","signes infectieux","pneumocoque","\u00E9l\u00E9ment clef du diagnostic","diagnostic \u00E9tiologique fiable","fi\u00E8vre","catarrhalis","rhinovirus","chronic bronchitis results from various causes but infection is involved in about","should be performed","Sputum examination","mostly viral","expectoration mucopurulente","germes atypiques","radiographie de thorax","Severity assessment","appr\u00E9ciation de la gravit\u00E9","\u00E9l\u00E9ments cliniques","\u00E9l\u00E9ments d\u0027orientation","polypn\u00E9e sup\u00E9rieure","tachycardie sup\u00E9rieure","legionella urinary antigens","t\u00EAte des germes responsables","insuffisance respiratoire aigu\u00EB","cas de doute clinique","key exam","cough","however","Therefore Afssaps suggests using","base","toux","Agence fran\u00E7aise de s\u00E9curit\u00E9 sanitaire","risque de d\u00E9compensation","recherche d\u0027antig\u00E8nes urinaires","its specific management","suivi","available","raison de la mortalit\u00E9","pr\u00E9sence de bact\u00E9ries","bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive","connaissance du volume expiratoire maximal","prise","pneumonies","enjeu important","produits de sant\u00E9","origine infectieuse","foyer","matit\u00E9","indication","existence","bronchite","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","charge sp\u00E9cifique","valeur diagnostique","intensit\u00E9 de la dyspn\u00E9e","l\u00E9gionellose","analyse","revanche","param\u00E8tre","ordre"],"language":"fr"},

Temperature-sensitive mutations in SKP1 define two distinct phenotypic classes. skp1-4 mutants arrest predominantly as large budded cells with a G2 DNA content and short mitotic spindle, consistent with a role in kinetochore function. skp1-3 mutants, however, arrest predominantly as multiply budded cells with a G1 DNA content, suggesting an additional role during the G1/S phase. Identification of Skp1p homologs from C. elegans, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens indicates that SKP1 is evolutionarily highly conserved.

Immunosuppression can be caused by pathogens such as chicken infectious anemia virus, infectious bursal disease virus, reovirus, and some retroviruses (e.g., reticuloendotheliosis virus). Mycotoxins and stress, often caused by poor management practices, can also cause immunosuppression. The effects on the innate and acquired immune responses and the mechanisms by which mycotoxins, stress and infectious agents cause immunosuppression are discussed. Immunoevasion is a common ploy by which viruses neutralize or evade immune responses. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus have multiple genes, some of them host-derived, which interfere with effective innate or acquired immune responses. RNA viruses may escape acquired humoral and cellular immune responses by mutations in protective antigenic epitopes (e.g., avian influenza viruses), while accessory non-structural proteins or multi-functional structural proteins interfere with the interferon system (e.g., Newcastle disease virus).","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schat, Karel A.; Skinner, Michael A.","journal":"Avian Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27893ae01067049143a474350c5ed8cd93d30593.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150009.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123969651000169; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123969651000169","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mycotoxins"],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular immune responses","infectious bursal disease virus","Newcastle disease virus","reticuloendotheliosis virus","DNA viruses","RNA viruses","Subclinical immunosuppression","chicken infectious anemia virus","infectious agents","avian influenza viruses","stress","Mycotoxins","subsequent development of clinical disease","accessory non-structural proteins","multi-functional structural proteins","protective antigenic epitopes","mutations","interferon system","underestimated factor","herpesvirus","poxvirus","reovirus","pathogens","multiple genes","chickens","retroviruses","mechanisms","poor management practices","common ploy","Immunoevasion","host","effects"],"language":"en"},

This paper reports NMR structure determinations of the C-terminal domain (SUD-C) and of a two-domain construct (SUD-MC) containing the middle domain (SUD-M) and the C-terminal domain, and NMR data on the conformational states of the N-terminal domain (SUD-N) and the SUD-NM two-domain construct. Both SUD-N and SUD-NM are monomeric and globular in solution, and in SUD-NM there is high mobility in the two-residue interdomain linking sequence, with no preferred relative orientation of the two domains. SUD-C adopts a frataxin-like fold and has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNA-modifying enzymes. The structures of both SUD-M (previously determined) and SUD-C (from the present study) are maintained in SUD-MC, where the two domains are flexibly linked. Gel shift experiments showed that both SUD-C and SUD-MC bind to single-stranded RNA and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, whereby SUD-MC binds to a more restricted set of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-M. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with observation of the (15)N-labeled proteins further resulted in the delineation of the RNA binding sites, i.e., in SUD-M a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity, and in SUD-C several residues of an antiparallel \u03B2-sheet. Overall, the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving concerted actions of SUD-M and SUD-C, which result in specific RNA-binding that might be unique to the SUD, and thus to the SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Margaret A.; Chatterjee, Amarnath; Neuman, Benjamin W.; W\u00FCthrich, Kurt","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9582edf55cf71b2fb09e62f2f268fe778cf29189.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a727b4a6c7ef9a2df2a9fb909eadfc09ed11c8fa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4905527694d78d051ccafe15f482868a486b0bf8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2958096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493876/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283610005061; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.05.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283610005061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SUD-C","SUD-NM","SUD-MC binds","concerted actions of SUD","C-terminal domain","N-terminal domain","domain construct","middle domain","globular domains","DNA-binding domains of DNA","RNA binding sites","specific RNA-binding","NMR data","RNA sequences","SARS-CoV","purine bases","single-stranded RNA","present data","SARS-unique region","NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments","Gel shift experiments","pyrimidine bases","present study","paper reports NMR structure determinations","restricted set of purine","molecular mechanisms","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","evidence","observation","structural similarity","conformational states","nsp3","fold","residues","solution","short linker peptide segments","pronounced cavity","high mobility","preferred relative orientation","residue interdomain","delineation","frataxin","antiparallel \u03B2-sheet","surface area","enzymes","nonstructural protein","proteins","structures"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we discuss recent data on mechanisms of alteration of lipid metabolic pathways during infection by flaviviruses, with a focus on cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, which can be manipulated by the invading viruses to support replication, but can also be modulated by the host immune system itself, as a means to fight infection.","publish_time":"2018-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pombo, Joao Palma; Sanyal, Sumana","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2a4b60c4285348cbc44c501adc3dbdc4088870b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5994796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29915602/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lipid metabolic pathways","catabolic pathways","replication sites","hand","Cellular lipid homeostasis","recent data","recent evidence","host cells","invading viruses","host immune system","mechanisms of alteration","focus","flaviviruses","counter strategies","cholesterol","linked array of anabolic","fatty acid biosynthesis","membrane components","ATP","response","means","review","networks","interferon","flavivirus infections","antiviral environment"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this elective is to provide students with an opportunity to observe the health care and public health delivery systems in low-income countries, provide medical service and have a cross-cultural experience. Over the course of the past 35 years, 388 students have participated in this global health elective in more than 41 low-income countries. The most popular sites include the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, India, Kenya and Thailand. Overall, interest in this elective has persisted throughout the course of time, sometimes temporarily increasing or decreasing with outside factors, such as the events of 11 September 2001 and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. Recent annual applications for this elective have been as high as 44 out of a class of 200 students. Over the past 10 years, annual acceptance rates have varied, ranging from a low of 32 % in 2007\u20132008 to a high of 74 % in 2010\u20132011 and 2013\u20132014. Careful screening, including a written application, review of academic records and personal interviews has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable and dedicated students who have performed well at overseas sites. Student rated satisfaction levels with this elective are almost universally high, with most rating it the best experience of their medical school years. Students undergo extensive preparation prior to their travel overseas, including a review of individual health and safety issues, travel and lodging, and the nature of the host country culture, health care system and assignment site. Downstate medical students are especially experienced in cross-cultural understanding because of the unusual diversity of the patient population in Brooklyn, and the diversity of local hospital staff and the medical school class. The Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine has steadfastly supported this elective with both a philosophical commitment and financial grants to help defray costs since the very early years. The Dr. Michael and Lona B. Kenn\u00E9y Endowment, the Joshua H. Weiner endowment, and the LSK Foundation have also provided financial support for this elective. Throughout the course of this elective, overseas preceptors have willingly given of their time and institutional resources to make these experiences available and meaningful for our students.","publish_time":"2015-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruno, Denise Marie; Imperato, Pascal James","journal":"J Community Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7a67bad4d9f35ea6f98bf57ec599c81adf99d56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25564184/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-014-9981-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Michael","Lona B.

The genome was directly accessed from the stool sample of a patient in Beijing. Comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the sequence variations of 116 SARS-CoV genomes (including BJ202) available in the NCBI Gen-Bank. With the genome sequence of GZ02 as the reference, there were 41 polymorphic sites identified in BJ202 and a total of 278 polymorphic sites present in at least two of the 116 genomes. The distribution of the polymorphic sites was biased over the whole genome. Nearly half of the variations (50.4%, 140/278) clustered in the one third of the whole genome at the 3\u2032 end (19.0 kb-29.7 kb). Regions encoding Orf10\u201311, Orf3/4, E, M and S protein had the highest mutation rates. A total of 15 PCR products (about 6.0 kb of the genome) including 11 fragments containing 12 known polymorphic sites and 4 fragments without identified polymorphic sites were cloned and sequenced. Results showed that 3 unique polymorphic sites of BJ202 (positions 13 804, 15 031 and 20 792) along with 3 other polymorphic sites (26 428, 26 477 and 27 243) all contained 2 kinds of nucleotides. It is interesting to find that position 18379 which has not been identified to be polymorphic in any of the other 115 published SARS-CoV genomes is actually a polymorphic site. The nucleotide composition of this site is A (8) to G (6). Among 116 SARS-CoV genomes, 18 types of deletions and 2 insertions were identified. Most of them were related to a 300 bp region (27 700\u201328 000) which encodes parts of the putative ORF9 and ORF10\u201311. A phylogenetic tree illustrating the divergence of whole BJ202 genome from 115 other completely sequenced SARS-CoVs was also constructed.

Serological surveillance is the common monitoring method used in laboratory animals. A rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective high-throughput Luminex xMAP assay could be an attractive alternative to labor-intensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. In this study, recombinant proteins from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and rabbit rotavirus and whole viral lysates of Sendai virus were used as coating antigens in an xMAP assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against these pathogens. The xMAP assay showed high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay and inter-assay comparisons was less than 3% and 4%, respectively, indicating good repeatability and stability of the assay. The xMAP assay exhibited similar limits of detection for rabbit hemorrhagic virus and Sendai virus and was less sensitive for the detection of rabbit rotavirus when compared with commercial ELISA kits. A total of 52 clinical samples were tested simultaneously using both the xMAP assay and ELISA kits. The results obtained using these two methods were 100% coincident. In summary, the novel xMAP assay offers an alternative choice for rapid and sensitive high-throughput detection of antibodies in rabbit serum and can be used as a daily monitoring tool for laboratory animals.

The results of cross-virus-neutralization tests and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit of spike gene of these vaccine strains and other reference strains showed that strain LJL/110302 was of GI-19 lineage, whereas LLN/111169 was of the GI-1 lineage of the Conn serotype. Further comparative genomic analysis revealed that LLN/111169, an IBV strain with novel traits, originated from multiple recombination events (at least 3 recombination sites) between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. LLN/111169 was pathogenic to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. This is of prime importance because while IBV prevention measures worldwide are mainly dependent on modified live vaccine strains, our results showed that recombination between field and vaccine strains has produced a novel pathogenic IBV strain.

The validity of this classical conclusion has recently been questioned by the demonstration of axonal demyelination. In addition, axons are submitted to a profound alteration of their glial environment. This work was, therefore, undertaken to reassess axonoglial interactions over time after an excitotoxic lesion in the rat. Ultrastructural studies were carried out in the ventrobasal thalamus two days to 18 months after neuronal depletion by in situ injections of kainic acid. In some cases, lemniscal afferents were identified by using anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from the dorsal column nuclei. Two and four days after kainate injection, numerous dying axons displaying typical signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed in a neuropile characterized by the loss of neuronal somata and dendrites, an increase in number of microglia/macrophages and the disappearance of astrocytes. Ten and 12 days after kainate injection, degenerating axons were no longer observed although myelin degeneration of otherwise unaltered axons was ongoing with an accumulation of myelin remnants in the neuropile. At 16 and 20 days, the demyelination process was apparently complete and axons of different diameters were sometimes packed together. One and two months after kainate injection, the axonal environment changed again: remyelination of large-caliber axons occurred at the same time as reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and numerous Schwann cells appeared in the tissue. Schwann cell processes surrounded aggregates of axons of diverse calibers, ensheathed small ones and myelinated larger ones. Axons were also remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled lemniscal afferents could be myelinated by either of the two cell types. After three months, the neuropile exhibited an increase in number of hypertrophied astrocytes and the progressive loss of any other cellular or axonal element. At this stage, remaining Schwann cells were surrounded by a glia limitans formed by astrocytic processes. These data indicate that although excitotoxins are sparing the axons, they are having a profound and complex effect on the axonal environment. Demyelination occurs over the first weeks, accompanying the loss of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Axonal ensheathment and remyelination takes place in a second period, associated with the reappearance of oligodendrocytes and recruitment of numerous Schwann cells, while reactive astrocytes appear in the tissue at a slightly later time. Over the following months, astrocytes occupy a greater proportion of the neuron-depleted territory and other elements decrease in number. These successive stages in alteration of axonoglial interactions seem to evolve in parallel to the changes in density and terminal morphology that we described earlier for myelinated afferent fibers to the excitotoxic lesion.","publish_time":"1992-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dusart, I.; Marty, S.; Peschanski, M.","journal":"Neuroscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4462c1c009f0ac169dfa3d34817190c78ceb19c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229290478K; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/030645229290478K","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Schwann"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aggregates of axons","unaltered axons","caliber axons","degenerating axons","axons of passage","numerous dying axons","loss of astrocytes","axons of different diameters","reactive astrocytes","days","axonal environment","disappearance of astrocytes","number of hypertrophied astrocytes","kainate injection","Axonal ensheathment","neuropile","axonal element","demonstration of axonal demyelination","recruitment of numerous Schwann cells","remaining Schwann cells","Schwann cell processes","following months","reappearance of oligodendrocytes","myelinated afferent fibers","increase","horseradish peroxidase","myelinated larger ones","loss of neuronal somata","progressive loss","myelin degeneration","excitotoxic lesion","alteration of axonoglial interactions","profound alteration","number of microglia","glial environment","tissue","lemniscal afferents","later time","demyelination process","neuronal depletion","remyelination of large","astrocytic processes","Abstract Excitotoxins","cell types","ensheathed small ones","accumulation of myelin remnants","typical signs of Wallerian degeneration","diverse calibers","greater proportion","neuron-depleted territory","anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin","macrophages","dendrites","neurons","situ injections of kainic acid","glia limitans","changes","density","elements","dorsal column nuclei","successive stages","place","complex effect","terminal morphology","ventrobasal thalamus","period","weeks","validity","classical conclusion","cases","Ultrastructural studies","data","addition","work"],"language":"en"},

Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23\u00B77%), diabetes mellitus (16\u00B72%), coronary heart diseases (5\u00B78%), and cerebrovascular disease (2\u00B73%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4 The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4 Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5 ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. \u2022 View related content for this article If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Lei; Karakiulakis, George; Roth, Michael","journal":"The Lancet Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad3bfbf5daf646a4ba1be6495c8b83c797944577.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118626.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260020301168; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30116-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171062/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213260020301168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Xiaobo Yang"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","increased expression of ACE2","upregulation of ACE2","ACE2 polymorphisms","hypertension treatment","severe COVID","diabetes mellitus","ACE2-modulating medications","ACE inhibitors","comorbidities of hypertension","confirmed COVID","studies of patients","ARBs","increased risk of SARS","fatal COVID","severe disease","SARS-CoV","cerebrovascular diseases","type","angiotensin","infection","intensive care unit patients","cardiac diseases","inflammatory lung diseases","suitable alternative treatment","novel coronavirus disease","higher risk","coronary heart diseases","drugs","enzyme","distinctive comorbidities","frequent comorbidities","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","receptor blockers","epithelial cells","target cells","potential new therapy","antihypertensive calcium channel blockers","intestine","Human pathogenic coronaviruses","group","cancer","Xiaobo Yang","colleagues1","non-survivors","blood vessels","kidney","combination","cerebral stroke","activity","genetic predisposition","article","individual","evidence","conflict","inflammation","study2","related content","information","sensitivity","hypothesis","Asian populations","thiazolidinediones","hospital","data","PubMed search","ibuprofen","aspect"],"language":"en"},

Little was known about the performance of the assays for the detection of novel H1N1 in the background of seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and other circulating respiratory viruses. In addition, subtyping influenza A became critical for the identification of high risk and/or hospitalized patients with novel H1N1 infection and for monitoring the spread of the outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzed the performances of the BinaxNOW Influenza A\u0026B test (BinaxNOW), the 3M Rapid Detection Flu A \u002B B test (3MA \u002B B), direct immunofluorescence, R-Mix culture and the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) for the detection of seasonal influenza, novel H1N1 and other respiratory viruses. RVP was also evaluated for its ability to differentiate seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and novel H1N1. RESULTS: The sensitivities, specificities, PPVs and NPVs for the detection of novel H1N1, determined by comparing all four-test methods, were: rapid antigen: 17.8%, 93.6%, 77.4%, 47.9%; DFA: 46.7%, 94.5%, 91.3%, 58.9%; R-Mix culture: 88.9%, 100%, 100%, 87.9%; RVP: 97.8%, 100%, 100%, 97.3%. The individual sensitivities of BinaxNOW and 3MA \u002B B as compared to R-Mix culture for the detection of novel H1N1 were 9.6% and 40%, respectively. All unsubtypeable influenza A specimens identified by RVP and tested with the CDC novel H1N1 specific RT-PCR assay were confirmed to be novel H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen tests, DFA, R-Mix culture and the xTAG RVP test all detected the novel H1N1 strain, but with highly varied sensitivity. The RVP test provided the best diagnostic option as RVP demonstrated superior sensitivity for the detection of all influenza strains, including the novel H1N1, provided accurate influenza A subtyping and identified a significant number of additional respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2009-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ginocchio, Christine C.; Zhang, Frank; Manji, Ryhana; Arora, Suman; Bornfreund, Mark; Falk, Leon; Lotlikar, Madhavi; Kowerska, Margaret; Becker, George; Korologos, Diamanto; de Geronimo, Marcella; Crawford, James M.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172175.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540158/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.06.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","BinaxNOW Influenza A\u0026B","3M Rapid Detection Flu A   B","Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","RVP","DFA","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of novel H1N1","novel influenza","novel H1N1 infection","novel H1N1 strain","H1N1 outbreak","background of seasonal H1N1","detection of seasonal influenza","BinaxNOW Influenza","xTAG RVP test","B test","subtyping influenza","R-Mix culture","CDC novel H1N1 specific RT-PCR assay","accurate influenza","influenza strains","unsubtypeable influenza","Rapid Detection Flu","viral culture","Rapid antigen tests","DFA","test methods","circulating respiratory viruses","direct immunofluorescence","viral diagnostic tests","H3N2","individual sensitivities of BinaxNOW","Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","significant number of additional respiratory pathogens","superior sensitivity","varied sensitivity","STUDY DESIGN","best diagnostic option","NY City area","hospitalized patients","NPVs","total","identification of high risk","patient samples","specificities","PPVs","performances","CONCLUSIONS","ability","assays","response","spread","specimens","week period","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs. This publication is the first to report CD66c (CEACAM6) as a glycoprotein receptor for Influenza A virus. Significance Statement Cells are enclosed by a semipermeable membrane that allows selective exchange of biomolecules between cells and their surroundings. A set of specialized proteins in this semipermeable membrane, work like gatekeepers to the cell and regulate entry of these biomolecules. One class of such surface proteins is termed as receptors. Viruses bind to one or more of these receptors and manipulate gatekeepers for their own successful entry into host-cells. A membrane protein that influenza A virus (Flu virus) uses for entry into the cells was not discovered till date. This study reports for the first time, a receptor for influenza A virus, that was sought after by researchers for decades.

In this model, MAS represents the process of spatiotemporal interactions among individuals, and SWN describes the social relation network among agents. The model is composed of agent attribute definitions, agent movement rules, neighborhoods, construction of social relation network among agents and state transition rules. The construction of social relation network and agent state transition rules is essential for implementing the proposed model. The decay effects of infection \u201Cmemory\u201D, distance and social relation between agents are introduced into the model, which are unavailable in traditional models. The proposed model is used to simulate the transmission process of flu in Guangzhou City based on the swarm software platform.

However, respiratory pathogen transmission in such confined settings in the tropics has not been well studied. METHODS: Recruits in four successive Royal Thai Army basic training classes living in military barracks were monitored for the symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or upper respiratory illness (URI). Classes 1 and 2 were also monitored after basic training. Nasal/throat swabs from acute illnesses were collected and tested by influenza RT-PCR (all four classes). In addition, class 1 had multiplex PCR performed along with the analysis of bed locations within the barracks. RESULTS: Influenza-like illness/upper respiratory illness rates ranged from 4\u00B77 to 6\u00B79 per 100 recruit-weeks in the four classes and generally decreased during the course of basic training (P \u003C 0\u00B705 in three of four classes). Rates during basic training were 1\u00B77 (95% CI: 1\u00B729, 2\u00B729) and 2\u00B75 (95% CI: 1\u00B75, 4\u00B71) times higher than after basic training (classes 1 and 2, respectively). In class 1, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus were the most commonly identified respiratory pathogens; only one influenza PCR-positive infection was detected in all four classes. Bed locations of URI/ILI cases in class 1 tended to be in closer proximity to each other. CONCLUSION: Basic training recruits in military barracks in the tropics had high rates of acute respiratory illnesses with illness patterns consistent with external seeding followed by substantial internal transmission. Our findings may contribute to control measures in similar confined settings both within and outside the military.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levy, Jens W; Bhoomiboonchoo, Piraya; Simasathien, Sriluck; Salje, Henrik; Huang, Angkana; Rangsin, Ram; Jarman, Richard G; Fernandez, Stefan; Klungthong, Chonticha; Hussem, Kittinun; Gibbons, Robert V; Yoon, In-Kyu","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86c378531ecb4b4d351c844fc4e3e5c9cf49f269.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4605412.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26271648/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12345","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Royal Thai Army","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Basic training recruits","course of basic training","upper respiratory illness rates","successive Royal Thai Army basic training classes","respiratory pathogen transmission","spread of respiratory pathogens","high rates of acute respiratory illnesses","influenza RT-PCR","symptoms of influenza","illness patterns consistent","military barracks present conditions favorable","influenza PCR-positive infection","acute illnesses","New recruits","tropics","Bed locations of URI","CI","similar confined settings","analysis of bed locations","ILI cases","substantial internal transmission","external seeding","control measures","times higher","coronavirus","parainfluenza virus","Nasal","throat swabs","rhinovirus","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","findings","recruit-weeks","addition","RESULTS","closer proximity"],"language":"en"},

When influenza A virus subtype H5 or H9 was added to the QD-LFIAS, the QD-labeled antibodies specifically bound to the H5 or H9 subtype viruses and were then captured by the coating antibodies at test line 1 or 2 to form a sandwich complex. This complex produced a bright fluorescent band in response to 365 nm ultraviolet excitation. The intensity of fluorescence can be detected using an inexpensive, low-maintenance instrument, and the virus concentration directly correlates with the fluorescence intensity. The detection limit of the QD-LFIAS for influenza A virus subtype H5 was 0.016 HAU, and the detection limit of the QD-LFIAS for influenza A virus subtype H9 was 0.25 HAU.

For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. METHODS: The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM\u2013based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. RESULTS: Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%). CONCLUSION: Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to rely on an antibody-based rapid test for public health measures such as community screenings.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00F6hla, M.; Boesecke, C.; Schulte, B.; Diegmann, C.; Sib, E.; Richter, E.; Eschbach-Bludau, M.; Aldabbagh, S.; Marx, B.; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, A.-M.; Schmithausen, R.M.; Streeck, H.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fa9ceafcec7846f5b3e8800777aec7d781ddf93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165286.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620301141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334183/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620301141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based test","evaluated rapid test","test performance","qPCR-negative individuals","selected individuals","diagnosed individuals","repeated qPCR","potential symptomatic individuals","public health measures","known SARS-CoV","based system","effective public health containment measures","current SARS-CoV2 outbreak","community screenings","time span","low sensitivity","high-prevalence community setting","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","IgG","IgM","countless tests","gold standard","COVID","contacts","travellers","screening centre","hours","STUDY DESIGN","infection","METHODS","antibody","positivity","CONCLUSION","drops of blood","OBJECTIVE","contrast","RESULTS","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish \u2018baseline\u2019 values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter.

In order for a SARS-CoV like virus circulating in wild life for a very long time to infect the index case-patient, a number of conditions must be met, foremost among which is the encounter with humans and the presence in homo sapiens of a cellular receptor allowing the virus to bind. Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binds to the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This molecule is a peptidase expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells and other tissues, that regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Humans are not equal with respect to the expression levels of the cellular ACE2. Moreover, ACE2 polymorphisms were recently described in human populations. Here we review the most recent evidence that ACE2 expression and/or polymorphism could influence both the susceptibility of people to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease.

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 \u00D7 10(\u22125)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, \u003C30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct \u003E99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewandowski, Kuiama; Xu, Yifei; Pullan, Steven T.; Lumley, Sheila F.; Foster, Dona; Sanderson, Nicholas; Vaughan, Alison; Morgan, Marcus; Bright, Nicole; Kavanagh, James; Vipond, Richard; Carroll, Miles; Marriott, Anthony C.; Gooch, Karen E.; Andersson, Monique; Jeffery, Katie; Peto, Timothy E.

We investigated distinctive clinical features of HBoV-positive children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS AND RESULTS: During April 2007\u2013July 2009, for 402 hospitalized children younger than 2 years with LRTI, we prospectively examined virus genomes in nasopharyngeal swabs for HBoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus, and adenovirus. The HBoV genomes were identified in 34 patients (8.5%). Clinical and laboratory data of HBoV-positive and other virus/bacteria-negative patients (n = 18) were analyzed and compared with data of RSV-single positive patients (n = 99). The seasonal distribution of HBoV exhibits a concentration of cases during March\u2013September, with most RSV cases occurring during winter in Japan. The minimum age of HBoV-positive patients was 5 months, although 44 patients (44%) with RSV were younger than 6 months. The main clinical features were respiratory distress and hypoxia. Hypoxia advances within 3 days after onset. The mean oxygen saturation on arrival was 92.8%, which was significantly lower than that in patients with RSV (p \u003C 0.001). White blood cell counts were similar among groups. However, the percentage of neutrophils in white blood cells were significantly higher in HBoV-positive patients (62 vs. 45%, p \u003C 0.001). Their prognoses were good. Their hospital stays were 6.6 days. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV-single positive patients show several clinical characteristics, such as seasonality, age, hypoxia, and neutrophilia, which differ from those with RSV infection.","publish_time":"2010-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moriyama, Yoko; Hamada, Hiromichi; Okada, Mineyuki; Tsuchiya, Nozomi; Maru, Hiromi; Shirato, Yuri; Maeda, Yasuhiro; Hirose, Yosuke; Yoshida, Masaki; Omura, Yoh; Honda, Takafumi; Muto, Ayako; Hayashi, Kitami; Terai, Masaru","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c38d6ab050242d8a1552846481949dc6aa75690.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2908446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383526/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-010-1183-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV-positive patients","HBoV-single positive patients","HBoV genomes","RSV infection","distinctive clinical features of HBoV","positive children","minimum age of HBoV","laboratory data of HBoV","data of RSV","RSV cases","seasonal distribution of HBoV","bacteria-negative patients","main clinical features","Clinical characteristics of human bocavirus","virus genomes","respiratory syncytial virus","lower respiratory tract infection","respiratory distress","LRTI","Hypoxia advances","months","days","white blood cells","hospitalized children younger","White blood cell counts","concentration of cases","nasopharyngeal swabs","OBJECTIVE","rhinovirus","groups","percentage of neutrophils","metapneumovirus","years","seasonality","CONCLUSIONS","mean oxygen saturation","arrival","parainfluenzavirus","onset","winter","Japan","BACKGROUND","adenovirus","hospital stays","importance","neutrophilia","METHODS","RESULTS","prognoses"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, SIVAGM is as much inhibited by human IFITM2 as by IFITM3 of its own host African green monkeys. Our data further demonstrate that the entry of SIVAGM is impaired by human IFITM2 and that this inhibition is overcome by the cholesterol-binding compound amphotericin B that also overcomes IFITM inhibition of influenza A viruses.

The infection may have started with an unowned shelter kitten that was hospitalized during this same period for a severe atypical upper respiratory infection. The causative agent was isolated from blood and nasal swabs from two cats; the electron microscopic appearance was typical for FCV and capsid gene sequencing showed it to be genetically similar to other less pathogenic field strains. An identical disease syndrome was recreated in laboratory cats through oral inoculation with tissue culture grown virus. During the course of transmission studies in experimental cats, the agent was inadvertently spread by caretakers to an adjoining room containing a group of four normal adult cats. One of the four older cats was found dead and a second was moribund within 48\u201372h in spite of symptomatic treatment; lesions in these animals were similar to those of the field cats but with the added feature of severe pancreatitis. The mortality in field cats, deliberately infected laboratory cats, and inadvertently infected laboratory cats ranged from 33\u201350%. This new isolate of calicivirus, named FCV-Ari, was neutralized at negligible to low titer by antiserum against the universal FCV-F9 vaccine strain. Cats orally immunized with FCV-F9, and then challenge-exposed shortly thereafter with FCV-Ari, developed a milder self-limiting form of disease, indicating partial protection. However, all of the field cats, including the three that died, had been previously immunized with parenteral FCV-F9 vaccine. FCV-Ari caused a disease that was reminiscent of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease, a highly fatal calicivirus infection of older rabbits.","publish_time":"2000-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, N.

Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Bingbing; Peng, Wenbo; Huang, Jia; Zhang, Hang; Zhou, Yingsi; Yang, Xiali; Liu, Jing; Li, Zhijie; Xu, Chunlong; Xue, Mingxing; Yang, Hui; Huang, Pengyu","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eed0db625a4520c7ae52aefe10bae3417d31c7f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a8be6ba53508e988c2c8c153478ff615b0d77687.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.945014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CRISPR/Cas9"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9","serum PCSK9","family of RNA","mediated delivery of CasRx","potent RNA knockdown efficiency","Pcsk9 sgRNAs","regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes","targeted genes","simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes","CasRx system","RNA virus infection diseases","metabolic disorders","metabolism functions","mouse liver","permanent knock","activity of Cas13d","designed metabolism modulation","complex metabolism networks","various Cas13d subtypes","significant potential","pathogenic DNA","genome DNA","permanent modification","useful strategy","HEK293T cells","mammalian cells","effective strategy","mouse hepatocytes","CRISPR effectors","significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels","adeno-associated virus","emerging approaches of CRISPR","strategies","RfxCas13d","concept trial","successful proof","regulation of cellular RNAs","treatment","Cas9","disruption","disease modelings","sgRNA arrays","therapies","lncLstr","Pten","SARS-Cov","present work","AAV","MERS infections","study"],"language":"en"},

The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus.

METHODS: Seven COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up chest HRCT. The main CT features and semi-quantitative score which represent disease severity among different clinical types were evaluated. RESULT: On initial CT, the main abnormalities observed in common and severe cases respectively were pure ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by GGOs. Critical cases had multiple consolidation surrounded by wide range of GGOs distributed in the whole lung fields. The scope and density score in common (4.5 and 5), severe (9.5 and 9.5) and critical (19 and 12) cases were increased by gradient. On follow-up CT, common and severe types manifested as decreasing density of lesion, absorbed consolidation and GGOs. Critical cases showed progression of the disease. The extent and progression scores in common and severe patients were significantly decreased, while the range score of patients with critical disease reached the highest points, accompanied with an increase in the density score. CONCLUSION: CT scanning can accurately assess the severity of COVID-19, and help to monitor disease transformation during follow-up among different clinical conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Yuting; Guo, Dandan; Li, Chunping; Chen, Tianwu; Li, Rui","journal":"Radiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d029030ccc7b490349980f2de1585c3d8b6ae731.json; document_parses/pdf_json/383da859d095798ef07e6c5e6f3477fd781d663a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217764.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352621120300474?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352621120300474; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","critical disease","follow-up CT","severe cases","Critical cases","range score of patients","disease severity","severe types","initial CT","density score","different clinical types","disease transformation","CT scanning","severity of COVID","manifestations of coronavirus disease","follow-up chest HRCT","different clinical conditions","main CT features","wide range of GGOs","semi-quantitative score","patchy consolidation","multiple consolidation","decreasing density of lesion","main abnormalities","progression scores","pure ground glass opacities","Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage","high resolution computed tomography","METHODS","highest points","increase","extent","scope","OBJECTIVE","lung fields","CONCLUSION","RESULT","gradient"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of relevant international concern, and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in the majority of cases. However, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and other complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death. Several cutaneous immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, are therapeutically managed with biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs. The outbreak of COVID-19 affects the management of these chronic conditions, not only for those who are already receiving treatment but also for those who are about to start a new treatment to control their disease.

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 hours to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, \u223C100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kashir, Junaid; Yaqinuddin, Ahmed","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/caff1d8219b57b6ed9ca6be083d4e7e1a0fd977d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361529/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698772030596X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109786; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772030596X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of COVID","coronavirus detection","coronavirus RNA","successful detection","detection of SARS","LAMP assay protocols","accurate methods of early detection","coronavirus disease","early diagnosis of COVID","enhanced LAMP protocols","field diagnosis of COVID","successful application of LAMP assays","novel coronavirus","viral spread","effectiveness of LAMP methodology","conventional RT-PCR methods","copies of viral RNA template","SARS-CoV","robust assay","Studies","Disease Control","molecular assays","trained professionals","trained analysts","isothermal amplification","specific expensive items of equipment","diagnostic tests","expensive reagents","patient samples","clinical samples","subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence","requirement of specialized equipment","mass-diagnostic testing","method of nucleic acid amplification","real-time polymerase chain reaction","American Centers","various forms","effective deployment","Prevention","increased sensitivity","numerous improvements","mitigation strategies","associated financial pressures","CDCs","fold","best chance","combinations of containment","low levels","initial characterization","instruments","future","specificity","recent advancements","illness progression","cost reduction","current times","capacity","global health community","requirements","Loop","view","findings","combat","viability","results","population","arguments","hours","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Recently, the notion that positive selection during epidemics or longer periods of exposure to common infectious diseases may have had a major effect in modifying the constitution of the human genome is being interrogated at a large scale in many populations around the world. This positive selection from infectious diseases increases power to detect associations in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has transformed both the management of infectious diseases and continues to enable large-scale functional characterization of host resistance/susceptibility alleles and loci; a paradigm shift from single candidate gene studies. Application of genome sequencing technologies and genomics has enabled us to interrogate the host-pathogen interface for improving human health. Human populations are constantly locked in evolutionary arms races with pathogens; therefore, identification of common infectious disease-associated genomic variants/markers is important in therapeutic, vaccine development, and screening susceptible individuals in a population. This review describes a range of host-pathogen genomic loci that have been associated with disease susceptibility and resistant patterns in the era of HTS. We further highlight potential opportunities for these genetic markers.","publish_time":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mboowa, Gerald; Sserwadda, Ivan; Amujal, Marion; Namatovu, Norah","journal":"Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e6b644a4ef4abd5283c18ec18237ca58e0d52e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5884297.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1875217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29755620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common infectious diseases","human genome","management of infectious diseases","human health","Human populations","identification of common infectious disease","disease susceptibility","range of host","pathogen genomic loci","positive selection","host-pathogen interface","genome-wide association studies","Application of genome sequencing technologies","vaccine development","susceptibility alleles","genomic variants","genetic markers","major effect","large-scale functional characterization of host resistance","major global public health threats","High-throughput sequencing","single candidate gene studies","paradigm shift","longer periods of exposure","associations","malaria","epidemics","power","screening susceptible individuals","pathogens","evolutionary arms races","tuberculosis","TB","HTS","era of","resistant patterns","genomics","GWASs","constitution","potential opportunities","resource-poor settings","HIV","AIDS","large scale","notion","world","review"],"language":"en"},

Variability of influenza A within the probe target region mandated the development of a novel molecular beacon, the \u201CMega\u201D molecular beacon (MegaBeacon; MegB), for the detection of influenza A with this method. MegaBeacon is a mismatch-tolerant molecular beacon that is also a TaqMan(\u00AE) probe. The triplex method (3QPCR-MegB) was evaluated with influenza A isolates covering 18 HxNx combinations, two influenza B isolates, and five Japanese influenza C isolates, as well as influenza A, B and C synthetic DNA targets. One to ten viral RNA and cDNA genome equivalents were detected per PCR reaction for influenza A, B and C. Seventy-one human nasopharyngeal aspirates from respiratory infections yielded 30 influenza A, 11 influenza B and 0 influenza C with 3QPCR-MegB, where immunofluorescence (IF) found 28 influenza A and 10 influenza B. 3QPCR-MegB was more mismatch-tolerant than a variant PCR with an influenza A TaqMan(\u00AE) probe (3QPCR) and is a sensitive and rational method to detect influenza viruses of animal and human origin.

Two antigenic peptides of the S spike glycoprotein (TGEV-S) amino acids (aa) 363\u2013371 and 521\u2013531 of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were tandemly introduced in the loop-structured, variable region aa 202\u2013218 of the major ClpG subunit protein composing the bulk of CS31A. The resulting hybrid fibrillae with a 25 aa heterologous peptide were produced at the cell surface. Using a monoclonal antibody (Mab) specific for the TGEV epitopes, purified hybrid fibrillae were analysed in Western blotting under native conditions, which showed that the two viral epitopes were recognized immunologically as an integral part of the hybrid fibrillae, and therefore that they were antigenically active. The immunogenicity of the fusion construct was evaluated with live recombinant bacteria, purified hybrid ClpG monomers, and purified chimeric CS31A polymers. Whatever the form of hybrid used as antigen, intraperitoneally immunized outbred mice elicited serum anti-TGEV peptides antibodies (Abs) with significant titres and capable of recognizing native TGEV particles, indicating that the epitopes are exposed in an immunogenic conformation in all cases. However, virus neutralization titres were only obtained after immunization with either purified polymers or monomers. Furthermore, 4 months after an ultimate immunization with 20 \u03BCg of hybrid fibrillae mice developed a strong anamnestic Ab response against the two TGEV peptides following booster inoculation with virions. We conclude that CS31A fibrillae carrying a combination of TGEV epitopes as insert can induce an immunological memory in outbred animals infected with TGEV, and therefore that hybrid CS31A fibrillae may prove efficient as components of a subunit vaccine.","publish_time":"1997-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Der Vartanian, Maurice; Girardeau, Jean-Pierre; Martin, Christine; Rousset, Elodie; Chavarot, Michel; Laude, Hubert; Contrepois, Michel","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0926c977088b8de6cf4d688ca070b1c0bcea20eb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X96001727; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X96001727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hybrid CS31A fibrillae","TGEV-S","resulting hybrid fibrillae","combination of TGEV epitopes","Abstract CS31A fibrillae","\u03BCg of hybrid fibrillae mice","form of hybrid","native TGEV particles","hybrid ClpG monomers","bulk of CS31A","serum anti-TGEV peptides antibodies","chimeric CS31A polymers","viral epitopes","antigenic peptides","immunized outbred mice","aa heterologous peptide","variable region aa","virus neutralization titres","significant titres","outbred animals","major ClpG subunit protein","ultimate immunization","subunit vaccine","native conditions","S spike glycoprotein","cell surface of certain Escherichia coli strains","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","strong anamnestic Ab response","live recombinant bacteria","capsule","immunological memory","Mab","insert","components","Western blotting","fusion construct","heteropolymeric proteinaceous appendages","amino acids","loop-structured","material","booster inoculation","virions","monoclonal antibody","immunogenic conformation","cases","immunogenicity","months"],"language":"en"},

Investigations included physical, ophthalmologic and neurological examination as well as hematology, serum biochemistry, MRI of the head and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Results MRI changes included thickening of the sphenoid bone and a loss of normal bone marrow signal on T1W MRI. Enhancement of the sphenoid bones, ventral meninges and ventral surface of the brain was present using paramagnetic contrast medium. CSF analysis was abnormal in the two dogs with increased cellularity, neutrophilic pleocytosis, intracellular bacteria and increased total protein in one, and with lymphocytic pleocytosis in another. CSF analysis was normal in the cat. An underlying cause for the osteomyelitis could not be identified. The use of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics for 3\u20136 weeks combined with anti\u2010inflammatory medications proved effective. Full clinical recovery occurred with no relapse during the follow up time of 7 (ESS) and 4 (Domestic Long Haired) years.

We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 60.4%-96.6%], and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%-99.9%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (kappa coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p \u003C0.001). Conclusions Saliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pasomsub, Ekawat; Watcharananan, Siriorn P.; Boonyawat, Kochawan; Janchompoo, Pareena; Wongtabtim, Garanyuta; Suksuwan, Worramin; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek; Phuphuakrat, Angsana","journal":"Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72672e348a82ea86cf201634c7440dd5cd788ef7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422408/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20302780; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20302780?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","throat swab RT-PCR","saliva sample RT-PCR","outbreak of COVID","prevalence of COVID","non-invasive sample","Conclusions Saliva","potential use of saliva samples","non-invasive tool","agreement","specimens","results","simplicity of specimen collection","reference standard","alternative specimen","novel coronavirus","easy method","increasing number of pandemic coronavirus disease","care","persons","university hospital","acute respiratory infection clinic","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","good diagnostic performance","median","need","detection","specificity","Abstract Objectives","male","SARS-CoV","kappa coefficient","non-aerosol","sensitivity","patients","age","confidence interval","cases","pairs","analysis","Methods","years"],"language":"en"},

Although its replication is restricted to plants, CPMV binds to and enters mammalian cells, including endothelial cells and particularly tumor neovascular endothelium in vivo. This natural capacity has lead to the use of CPMV as a sensor for intravital imaging of vascular development. Binding of CPMV to endothelial cells occurs via interaction with a 54 kD cell-surface protein, but this protein has not previously been identified. Here we identify the CPMV binding protein as a cell-surface form of the intermediate filament vimentin. The CPMV-vimentin interaction was established using proteomic screens and confirmed by direct interaction of CPMV with purified vimentin, as well as inhibition in a vimentin-knockout cell line. Vimentin and CPMV were also co-localized in vascular endothelium of mouse and rat in vivo. Together these studies indicate that surface vimentin mediates binding and may lead to internalization of CPMV in vivo, establishing surface vimentin as an important vascular endothelial ligand for nanoparticle targeting to tumors. These results also establish vimentin as a ligand for picornaviruses in both the plant and animal kingdoms of life. Since bacterial pathogens and several other classes of viruses also bind to surface vimentin, these studies suggest a common role for surface vimentin in pathogen transmission.","publish_time":"2009-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koudelka, Kristopher J.; Destito, Giuseppe; Plummer, Emily M.; Trauger, Sunia A.; Siuzdak, Gary; Manchester, Marianne","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc4e3f1afdbc64641df9ffa7707910d13014d529.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2670497.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19412526/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface vimentin","CPMV-vimentin interaction","Binding of CPMV","purified vimentin","use of CPMV","CPMV binding protein","internalization of CPMV","direct interaction of CPMV","intermediate filament vimentin","vimentin-knockout cell line","cell-surface form","kD cell-surface protein","endothelial cells","important vascular endothelial ligand","vascular endothelium of mouse","mammalian cells","studies","intravital imaging of vascular development","plant comovirus","tumor neovascular endothelium","sensor","common role","nanoparticle","proteomic screens","inhibition","wide variety of biomedical","material science applications","pathogen transmission","classes of viruses","picornaviruses","animal kingdoms of life","Cowpea mosaic virus","picornavirus superfamily","rat","tumors","bacterial pathogens","natural capacity","replication","plants","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study we sequenced the genome of a newly identified coronavirus dominant in ducks (DdCoV), and performed a large-scale surveillance of coronaviruses in chickens and ducks using a conserved RT-PCR assay. The viral genome harbors a tandem repeat which is rare in vertebrate RNA viruses. The repeat is homologous to some proteins of various cellular organisms, but its origin remains unknown. Many substitutions, insertions, deletions, and some frameshifts and recombination events have occurred in the genome of the DdCoV, as compared with the coronavirus dominant in chickens (CdCoV). The distances between DdCoV and CdCoV are large enough to separate them into different species within the genus Gammacoronavirus. Our surveillance demonstrated that DdCoVs and CdCoVs belong to different lineages and occupy different ecological niches, further supporting that they should be classified into different species. Our surveillance also demonstrated that DdCoVs and CdCoVs are prevalent in live poultry markets in some regions of China.

In this study, we employed various computational approaches to identify epitopes which has the potential for vaccine development. By analyzing the immune parameters of the conserved sequences of G glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential epitopes which may be used as peptide vaccines. Using different B cell epitope prediction servers, four highly similar B cell epitopes were identified. Immunoinformatics analyses revealed that LAEDDTNAQKT is a highly flexible and accessible B-cell epitope to antibody. Highly similar putative CTL epitopes were analyzed for their binding with the HLA-C 12*03 molecule. Docking simulation assay revealed that LTDKIGTEI has significantly lower binding energy, which bolstered its potential as epitope-based vaccine design. Finally, cytotoxicity analysis has also justified their potential as promising epitope-based vaccine candidate. In sum, our computational analysis indicates that either LAEDDTNAQKT or LTDKIGTEI epitope holds a promise for the development of universal vaccine against all kinds of pathogenic Henipavirus.

DTMUV infection mainly results in significant decreases in egg production in egg-laying ducks within 1\u20132 weeks post infection. However, information on the comparative protein expression of host tissues in response to DTMUV infection is limited. In the present study, the cellular protein response to DTMUV infection in duck ovarian follicles was analyzed using nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed 131 differentially expressed proteins, among which 53 were up regulated and 78 were down regulated. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and mitochondrial pathway. Some selected proteins that were found to be regulated in DTMUV-infected tissues were screened by quantitative real-time PCR to examine their regulation at the transcriptional level, western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of some selected proteins on translational level. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the proteomic changes in duck ovarian follicles following DTMUV infection. The protein-related information obtained in this study may be useful to understand the host response to DTMUV infection and the inherent mechanism of DTMUV replication and pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Kaikai; Zhao, Dongmin; Liu, Yuzhuo; Liu, Qingtao; Huang, Xinmei; Yang, Jing; An, Fengjiao; Li, Yin","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f1a7bb419c2658dfd71663cc87efd03a38f1716.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4815560.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27066001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["DTMUV infection","DTMUV-infected tissues","cellular protein response","selected proteins","inherent mechanism of DTMUV replication","duck ovarian follicles","protein biosynthesis","host response","duck industry","identified proteins","protein-related information","comparative protein expression of host tissues","Duck Tembusu virus","proteomic changes","Quantitative proteomic analysis","present study","cellular structure","egg production","transcriptional level","translational level","regulation of essential processes","western blot analysis","quantitative real-time PCR","modification","integrity","nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry","RNA processing","vesicle transport","massive economic losses","signal transduction","significant decreases","emerging pathogenic flavivirus","ducks","pathogenicity","mitochondrial pathway","China","weeks","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Sporadic incidence precludes evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy. We assessed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill children with influenza\u2013MRSA pneumonia and evaluated antibiotic use. METHODS: We enrolled children (\u003C18 years) with influenza infection and respiratory failure across 34 pediatric intensive care units 11/2008\u20135/2016. We compared baseline characteristics, clinical courses, and therapies in children with MRSA coinfection, non-MRSA bacterial coinfection, and no bacterial coinfection. RESULTS: We enrolled 170 children (127 influenza A, 43 influenza B). Children with influenza\u2013MRSA pneumonia (N = 30, 87% previously healthy) were older than those with non-MRSA (N = 61) or no (N = 79) bacterial coinfections. Influenza\u2013MRSA was associated with increased leukopenia, acute lung injury, vasopressor use, extracorporeal life support, and mortality than either group (P \u2264 .0001). Influenza-related mortality was 40% with MRSA compared to 4.3% without (relative risk [RR], 9.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8\u201322.9). Of 29/30 children with MRSA who received vancomycin within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, mortality was 12.5% (N = 2/16) if treatment also included a second anti-MRSA antibiotic compared to 69.2% (N = 9/13) with vancomycin monotherapy (RR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.4, 21.3; P = .003). Vancomycin dosing did not influence initial trough levels; 78% were \u003C10 \u00B5g/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza\u2013MRSA coinfection is associated with high fatality in critically ill children.

Though medical applications remain the major area of application, biosensors are gradually penetrating a wide variety of non-medical areas. Earlier predictions indicated that the medical application was around 90% of the total biosensor market, which includes clinical applications for diabetes, cholesterol, and coagulation monitoring. However, medical applications of biosensors are now down to around 60%. These changes are atributed to the rapidly advancing technologies and to some serious business challenges. The biosensor field has expanded dramatically in the past 45 years or so since the first demonstration of a biosensor application in 1962. Self-diagnosis of blood glucose levels by diabetes sufferers, however, remains the dominant area of biosensor application. The increased investment in new laboratories is essential to permit the application research required for determining the commercial applicability of biosensors. Different trends and models for collaboration between different entities are being noticed at the present time. Some of these trends are presented here. Incubators are springing up wherein scholarly research at universities may be gradually turned into or groomed to becoming successful business ventures. In effect, the future expansion of biosensor markets will depend on the balance between market opportunities and technical and/or financial obstacles. Different examples of biosensor companies along with their product and what analyte it detects have been described.

The potential of DNA vaccines to act in presence of maternal antibodies, its stability and cost effectiveness and the non-requirement of cold chain have heightened the prospects. Even though great strides have been made in nucleic acid vaccination, still there are many areas that need further research for its wholesome practical implementation. Major areas of concern are vaccine delivery, designing of suitable vectors and cytotoxic T cell responses. Also, the induction of immune responses by DNA vaccines is inconclusive due to the lack of knowledge regarding the concentration of the protein expressed in vivo. Alternative delivery systems having higher transfection efficiency and the use of cytokines, as immunomodulators, needs to be further explored. Recently, efforts are being made to modulate and prolong the active life of dendritic cells, in order to make antigen presentation a more efficacious one.

In response to identified gaps in the region, the Palliative Care Integration Project (PCIP) was developed to improve continuity and decrease variability of care to palliative patients with cancer. The infrastructure for the project included multi-institutional and multisectoral representation on the Steering Committee and on the Development, Implementation and Evaluation Working Groups. After review of the literature, five Collaborative Care Plans and Symptom Management Guidelines were developed and integrated with validated assessment tools (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and Palliative Performance Scale). These project resources were implemented in the community, the palliative care unit, and the cancer center. Surveys were completed by frontline health professionals (defined as health professionals providing direct care), and two independent focus groups were conducted to capture information regarding: 1) the development of the project and 2) the processes of implementation and usefulness of the different components of the project. Over 90 individuals from more than 30 organizations were involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the PCIP. Approximately 600 regulated health professionals and allied health professionals who provided direct care, and over 200 family physicians and medical residents, received education/training on the use of the PCIP resources. Despite unanticipated challenges, frontline health professionals reported that the PCIP added value to their practice, particularly in the community sector. The PCIP showed that a network in which each organization had ownership and where no organization lost its autonomy, was an effective way to improve integration and coordination of care delivery.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dudgeon, Deborah J.; Knott, Christine; Chapman, Cheryl; Coulson, Kathy; Jeffery, Elizabeth; Preston, Sharon; Eichholz, Mary; Van Dijk, Janice P.; Smith, Anne","journal":"Journal of Pain and Symptom Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b152d34ef49084fab76230427c4cc77bf5d0f3ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19699607/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392409005995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392409005995; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2008.12.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Steering Committee","Collaborative Care","Symptom Management Guidelines","Edmonton Symptom Assessment System","PCIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["direct care","health care providers","variability of care","continuum of care","Palliative Care Integration Project","palliative care unit","delivery of optimal palliative care","frontline health professionals","coordination of care delivery","allied health professionals","regulated health professionals","Collaborative Care Plans","project resources","PCIP resources","palliative patients","Development","Palliative Performance Scale","processes of implementation","Evaluation","Edmonton Symptom Assessment System","cancer center","community sector","validated assessment tools","Symptom Management Guidelines","independent focus groups","coordinated approach","multisectoral representation","region","education","medical residents","training","Steering Committee","family physicians","effective way","usefulness","literature","practice","different components","unanticipated challenges","autonomy","ownership","infrastructure","gaps","information","network","value","continuity","Surveys","response","review","organizations","individuals"],"language":"en"},

While several studies identified specific particle characteristics driving respiratory toxicity of low-solubility and low-toxicity particles such as CNP, the major lung cell type, which initiates and drives that response, remains still uncertain. Since alveolar macrophages (AM) are known to effectively phagocytose inhaled particles and play a crucial role for the initiation of pulmonary inflammation caused by invading microbes, we aimed to determine their role for sterile stimuli such as CNP by profiling the primary alveolar cell compartments of the lung. We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 20 \u03BCg CNP by intratracheal instillation and comprehensively investigated the expression of the underlying mediators during a time span of 3 to 72 h in three different lung cell populations: CD45- (negative) structural cells, CD45\u002B (positive) leukocytes, and by BAL recovered cells. RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis revealed an acute inflammatory response characterized by the most prominent culmination of neutrophil granulocytes from 12 to 24 h after instillation, which declined to basal levels by day 7. As early as 3 h after CNP exposure 50 % of the AM revealed particle laden. BAL concentrations and lung gene expression profiles of TNF\u03B1, and the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1,-2 and-5 preceded the neutrophil recruitment and showed highest levels after 12 h of CNP exposure, pointing to a significant activation of the inflammation-evoking lung cells at this point of time. AM, isolated from lungs 3 to 12 h after CNP instillation, however, did not show a pro-inflammatory signature. On the contrary, gene expression analysis of different lung cell populations isolated 12 h after CNP instillation revealed CD45-, mainly representing alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells as major producer of inflammatory CXCL cytokines. Particularly by CD45- cells expressed Cxcl5 proved to be the most abundant chemokine, being 12 h after CNP exposure 24 (\u00B111) fold induced. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that AM are noninvolved in the initiation of the inflammatory response. ATII cells, which induced highest CXCL levels early on, might in contrast be the driver of acute neutrophilic inflammation upon pulmonary CNP exposure.

HAV has several unique biological characteristics that distinguish it from other members of this family. Recent and previous studies revealed that codon usage plays a key role in HAV replication and evolution. In this study, the patterns of synonymous codon usage in HAV have been studied through multivariate statistical methods on 30 complete open reading frames (ORFs) from the available 30 full-length HAV sequences. Effective number of codons (ENC) indicates that the overall extent of codon usage bias in HAV genomes is significant. The relative dinucleotide abundances suggest that codon usage in HAV can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. These factors strongly correlated with the first major axis of correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU). The distribution of the HAV ORFs along the plane defined by the first two major axes in COA showed that different genotypes are located at different places in the plane, suggesting that HAV codon usage is also reflecting an evolutionary process. It has been very recently described that fine-tuning translation kinetics selection also contributes to codon usage bias of HAV. The results of these studies suggest that HAV genomic biases are the result of the co-evolution of genome composition, controlled translation kinetics and probably the ability to escape the antiviral cell responses.","publish_time":"2011-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019 Andrea, Luc\u00EDa; Pint\u00F3, Rosa M.; Bosch, Albert; Musto, H\u00E9ctor; Cristina, Juan","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d386b3998bdd6f0979e6a7adacdc0cfcdc7c63e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172775.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.01.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211000311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296111/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211000311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV","COA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAV codon usage","codon usage bias of HAV","HAV ORFs","HAV genomes","HAV replication","HAV genomic biases","relative synonymous codon usage","full-length HAV sequences","patterns of synonymous codon usage","overall extent of codon usage bias","COA","plane","controlled translation kinetics","relative dinucleotide abundances","different genotypes","fine-tuning translation kinetics selection","different places","major axes","previous studies","underlying biases","dinucleotide frequencies","family Picornaviridae","co-evolution of genome composition","major axis of correspondence analysis","complete open reading frames","ability","key role","multivariate statistical methods","hepatotropic member","RSCU","unique biological characteristics","Effective number of codons","antiviral cell responses","virus","study","evolutionary process","members","Hepatitis","distribution","results","factors"],"language":"en"},

A T7 phage display cDNA library from N2a cells was constructed, and the library was screened with the soluble PHE-CoV S glycoproteins. We used a coimmunoprecipitation assay to show that only the NCAM was a binding partner of spike protein. We found that a soluble form of anti-NCAM antibody blocked association of the PHE-CoV with N2a cells. Furthermore, double-stranded siRNA targeted against NCAM inhibited PHE-CoV infection.

Infection from individual strains has conventionally been thought to be species-specific. Here we applied the Virochip, a pan-viral microarray, to identify a novel adenovirus (TMAdV, titi monkey adenovirus) as the cause of a deadly outbreak in a closed colony of New World monkeys (titi monkeys; Callicebus cupreus) at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Among 65 titi monkeys housed in a building, 23 (34%) developed upper respiratory symptoms that progressed to fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis, and 19 of 23 monkeys, or 83% of those infected, died or were humanely euthanized. Whole-genome sequencing of TMAdV revealed that this adenovirus is a new species and highly divergent, sharing \u003C57% pairwise nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses. Cultivation of TMAdV was successful in a human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, but not in primary or established monkey kidney cells. At the onset of the outbreak, the researcher in closest contact with the monkeys developed an acute respiratory illness, with symptoms persisting for 4 weeks, and had a convalescent serum sample seropositive for TMAdV. A clinically ill family member, despite having no contact with the CNPRC, also tested positive, and screening of a set of 81 random adult blood donors from the Western United States detected TMAdV-specific neutralizing antibodies in 2 individuals (2/81, or 2.5%). These findings raise the possibility of zoonotic infection by TMAdV and human-to-human transmission of the virus in the population. Given the unusually high case fatality rate from the outbreak (83%), it is unlikely that titi monkeys are the native host species for TMAdV, and the natural reservoir of the virus is still unknown. The discovery of TMAdV, a novel adenovirus with the capacity to infect both monkeys and humans, suggests that adenoviruses should be monitored closely as potential causes of cross-species outbreaks.","publish_time":"2011-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Eunice C.; Yagi, Shigeo; Kelly, Kristi R.; Mendoza, Sally P.; Maninger, Nicole; Rosenthal, Ann; Spinner, Abigail; Bales, Karen L.; Schnurr, David P.; Lerche, Nicholas W.; Chiu, Charles Y.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f81a3ef89c4144309cf86374440e2a3a8a0e095c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3136464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Research Center"],"locations":["Western United States"],"keyphrases":["titi monkeys","discovery of TMAdV","Cultivation of TMAdV","titi monkey adenovirus","genome sequencing of TMAdV","novel adenovirus","humans","Adenoviruses","TMAdV-specific neutralizing antibodies","closed colony of New World monkeys","new species","human transmission","deadly outbreak","species outbreaks","CNPRC","native host species","upper respiratory symptoms","closest contact","human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line","acute respiratory illness","possibility of zoonotic infection","established monkey kidney cells","Western United States","Callicebus cupreus","random adult blood donors","California National Primate Research Center","researcher","fulminant pneumonia","convalescent serum sample seropositive","wide range of clinical illnesses","potential causes of cross","pan-viral microarray","high case fatality rate","vertebrates","natural reservoir","capacity","Virochip","screening","individuals","findings","weeks","DNA viruses","hepatitis","ill family member","individual strains","population","nucleotide identity","onset","building"],"language":"en"},

The study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves, surgical masks, N95 respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap, as well as hand hygiene compliance rates. Results During the study, the use of personal protective equipment during MERS-CoV compared with theperiod before MERS-CoV increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P\u003C.0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient-days (P \u003C.0000001) for N95 masks.

Upon incorporation of CDs into the design of a polymeric vector, not only can the flexibility of the design be increased, but the development of a multifunctional carrier for genetic manipulation can also be facilitated.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Wing-Fu","journal":"Delivery of Therapeutics for Biogerontological Interventions","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdffb7dbef5e52f33089bd92d58af50e02041b37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150343.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128164853000052; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128164853000052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Technologies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of CDs","incorporation of CDs","genetic manipulation","versatility of polymeric vectors","design","delivery performance","previous chapter","nucleic acid delivery","high practical potential","promising application potential","controlled drug release","different areas","chiral separation of basic drugs","host","Abstract Technologies","metabolic pathways","development","multifunctional carrier","guest inclusion complexation","years","nonviral carriers","series of techniques","aging","flexibility","applications","cyclodextrins"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wei; Cui, Huaqian; Li, Kunwei; Fang, Yijie; Li, Shaolin","journal":"Pediatr Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abc71fcde4dd1badea9def9a14b2a42251e5c263.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080075.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162081/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CT scan","CT abnormality","included children","chest CT findings","COVID","days","years of age","positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","form of patchy ground-glass opacities","China","large tertiary-care hospital","modest lung abnormalities","small paediatric cohort","core clinical observations","reports","adults","treatment","onset of symptoms","months","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","period","BACKGROUND","Infection","MATERIALS","METHODS","admission","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peyronnet, V.; Sibiude, J.; Deruelle, P.; Huissoud, C.; Lescure, X.; Lucet, J.-C.; Mandelbrot, L.; Nisand, I.; Vayssi\u00E8re, C.; Yazpandanah, Y.; Luton, D.; Picone, O.","journal":"Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9cea735296902bab737d1a1dab469f87e60a5ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pregnant women","SARS-Covid","cases of newborns","proven cases of SARS","cases of respiratory distress","mild symptoms","in-depth analysis of cases","cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission","epidemic","knowledge","presence of symptoms","pregnancy","mild infectious syndrome","consequences of respiratory infections","newborns of infected mothers","management of possible","infectious diseases","neonatal transmission","Chinese data","possible digestive disorders","myalgia","headache","fever","cough","different degrees","neonatalogy","obstetrics","societies of gynecology","French protocol","higher risk","period","advancement","Induced prematurity","serious pulmonary pathologies","daily basis","death","vertical perpartum","influenza","new coronavirus","origin","China","proposals","subject","context","general population","end","continents"],"language":"en"},

This methodological review introduces unique taxonomies to synthesize over 80 AD algorithms based on these six themes: (1) CCU; (2) Physiologic Data Source; (3) Harvested data; (4) Data Analysis; (5) Clinical Evaluation; and (6) Clinical Implementation. Review results show that most published algorithms: (a) are designed for one specific type of CCU; (b) are validated on data harvested only from one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) monitor; (c) generate Signal Quality Indicators (SQI) that are not yet formalised for useful integration in clinical workflows; (d) operate either in standalone mode or coupled with CED or PD applications; (e) are rarely evaluated in real-time; and (f) are not implemented in clinical practice. In conclusion, it is recommended that AD algorithms conform to generic input and output interfaces with commonly defined data: (1) type; (2) frequency; (3) length; and (4) SQIs. This shall promote (a) reusability of algorithms across different CCU domains; (b) evaluation on different OEM monitor data; (c) fair comparison through formalised SQIs; (d) meaningful integration with other AD, CED and PD algorithms; and (e) real-time implementation in clinical workflows.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nizami, Shermeen; Green, James R.; McGregor, Carolyn","journal":"IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/862b1e02617c978e06fc34fdf46f5e3ca49faba6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23372087/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00086v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2013.2243724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Critical Care Units","Clinical Event Detection","CCU","Physiologic Data Source","Clinical Implementation","Original Equipment Manufacturer","Signal Quality Indicators","CED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of data","defined data","Data Analysis","AD algorithms","PD algorithms","Clinical Evaluation","clinical workflows","Clinical Implementation","Physiologic Data Source","different OEM monitor data","clinical practice","CED","Clinical Event Detection","reusability of algorithms","published algorithms","different CCU domains","specific type of CCU","formalised SQIs","PD applications","real-time implementation","meaningful integration","Artifact Detection","useful integration","methodological review","Review results","Signal Quality Indicators","fair comparison","Critical Care Units","output interfaces","generic input","techniques","impact of artifacts","Original Equipment Manufacturer","unique taxonomies","Parameter Derivation","standalone mode","themes","frequency","length","conclusion"],"language":"en"}]}

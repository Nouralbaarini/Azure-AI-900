Therefore, models were developed to predict high and low dengue incidence in order to provide timely forewarnings in the Philippines. METHODS: Model inputs were chosen based on studies indicating variables that may impact dengue incidence. The method first uses Fuzzy Association Rule Mining techniques to extract association rules from these historical epidemiological, environmental, and socio-economic data, as well as climate data indicating future weather patterns. Selection criteria were used to choose a subset of these rules for a classifier, thereby generating a Prediction Model. The models predicted high or low incidence of dengue in a Philippines province four weeks in advance. The threshold between high and low was determined relative to historical incidence data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Model accuracy is described by Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, and Specificity computed on test data not previously used to develop the model. Selecting a model using the F(0.5) measure, which gives PPV more importance than Sensitivity, gave these results: PPV = 0.780, NPV = 0.938, Sensitivity = 0.547, Specificity = 0.978. Using the F(3) measure, which gives Sensitivity more importance than PPV, the selected model had PPV = 0.778, NPV = 0.948, Sensitivity = 0.627, Specificity = 0.974. The decision as to which model has greater utility depends on how the predictions will be used in a particular situation. CONCLUSIONS: This method builds prediction models for future dengue incidence in the Philippines and is capable of being modified for use in different situations; for diseases other than dengue; and for regions beyond the Philippines. The Philippines dengue prediction models predicted high or low incidence of dengue four weeks in advance of an outbreak with high accuracy, as measured by PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, and Specificity.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buczak, Anna L.; Baugher, Benjamin; Babin, Steven M.; Ramac-Thomas, Liane C.; Guven, Erhan; Elbert, Yevgeniy; Koshute, Phillip T.; Velasco, John Mark S.; Roque, Vito G.; Tayag, Enrique A.; Yoon, In-Kyu; Lewis, Sheri H.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e572a3a154399f2b500b0f547a7252c94580acf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3983113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722434/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002771","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fuzzy Association Rule Mining","Positive Predictive Value","PPV"],"locations":["Philippines"],"keyphrases":["low dengue incidence","low incidence of dengue","PPV","Sensitivity","future dengue incidence","Philippines dengue prediction models","Model accuracy","historical incidence data","Accurate prediction of dengue incidence levels weeks","NPV","selected model","Model inputs","Specificity","high accuracy","advance","Philippines province","climate data","socio-economic data","test data","association rules","outbreak","importance","measure","Negative Predictive Value","Positive Predictive Value","future weather patterns","Fuzzy Association Rule Mining techniques","order","timely forewarnings","use","mortality","diseases","studies","classifier","BACKGROUND","results","different situations","greater utility","predictions","subset","morbidity","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","variables","neglected disease","METHODS","decision","threshold","regions","particular situation","Selection criteria"],"language":"en"},

The genus Torovirus, within the family Coronaviridae, is less well characterized, in part because toroviruses cannot yet be grown in cell culture (except for the Berne virus). In this study, we determined the sequence of the complete genome of Breda-1 (BoTV-1), a bovine torovirus. This is the first complete torovirus genome sequence to be reported. BoTV-1 RNA was amplified using long RT-PCR and the amplicons sequenced. The genome has a length of 28.475kb and consisted mainly of the replicase gene (\u223C20.2kb) which contains two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, respectively. Sequence analysis identified conserved domains within the predicted sequences of pp1a and pp1b. Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure prediction data suggest the presence of a 3C-like serine protease domain with similarity to the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease and a single papain-like cysteine protease domain with similarity to the picornavirus leader protease. The ADRP (APPR-1\u2033) domain \u2013 unique to the Coronaviridae \u2013 was also located in BoTV pp1a. In addition, several hydrophobic domains were identified that are typical of a nidovirus replicase. Within the pp1b sequence the polymerase and helicase domains were identified, as well as sequences predicted to be involved in ribosomal frameshifting, including the conserved slippery sequence UUUAAAC and two potential pseudoknot structures.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Draker, Ryan; Roper, Rachel L.; Petric, Martin; Tellier, Raymond","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3361db032c5bd76e9fb45c2178249b55e72fc62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114287.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170205002297; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170205002297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sequence alignments","Sequence analysis","complete torovirus genome sequence","serine protease domain","pp1b","BoTV pp1a","cysteine protease domain","conserved slippery sequence UUUAAAC","conserved domains","family Coronaviridae","predicted sequences of pp1a","similarity","picornavirus leader protease","hydrophobic domains","helicase domains","polyproteins pp1a","complete genome of Breda","genus Torovirus","bovine torovirus","HCoV-NL63","SARS-HCoV","nidovirus replicase","replicase gene","new human coronavirus","ORF1b","protein secondary structure prediction data","ORF1a","single papain","arterivirus","presence","recent discovery","potential pseudoknot structures","large overlapping ORFs","ribosomal frameshifting","long RT-PCR","cell culture","Berne virus","amplicons","outbreaks","Abstract Viruses","polymerase","APPR","addition","ADRP","toroviruses","length","study"],"language":"en"},

There is no vaccine for HRSV and anti-viral therapeutics are not broadly applicable. To investigate the effect of HRSV biology in children, nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from children with different viral loads and a combined high throughput RNAseq and label free quantitative proteomics approach was used to characterize the nucleic acid and proteins in these samples. HRSV proteins were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from infected children, and their abundance correlated with viral load (Ct value), confirming HRSV infection. Analysis of the HRSV genome indicated that the children were infected with sub-group A virus and that minor variants in nucleotide frequency occurred in discrete clusters along the HRSV genome, and within a patient clustered distinctly within the glycoprotein gene. Data from the samples were binned into four groups; no-HRSV infection (control), high viral load (Ct \u003C 20), medium viral load (Ct = 20\u201325), and low viral load (Ct \u003E 25). Cellular proteins associated with the anti-viral response (e.g., ISG15) were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and their abundance was correlated with viral load.

Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC50: 2.16 \u03BCg/mL) or after the polarization (EC50: 5.99 \u03BCg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells. Cephalandole B did not inhibit the IL-17A protein secretion. Nevertheless, both isolates notably inhibited IL-17A gene expression, especially cephalandole B, in a dose-dependent manner in Jukat cells with IL-17A luciferase reporter. Conclusions Indole alkaloids, indigodoles A, C, D, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to anti-IL 17A properties of Qing Dai. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated in this investigation for further promising anti-IL-17 lead drugs development.","publish_time":"2020-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Chia-Lin; Wang, Chien-Ming; Kuo, Yueh-Hsiung; Yen, Hung-Rong; Song, Ying-Chyi; Chou, Yu-Lun; Chen, Chao-Jung","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4a898a937cf15b27b4376fba9d51c79ed238304.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156250.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119334890; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119334890; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.112772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Qing Dai","Cephalandole"],"organizations":["TCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibited IL","promising anti-IL","properties of Qing Dai","bioactive components of Qing Dai","cephalandole B","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Qing Dai","Th17 cells","Th17 polarization","TCM","new indigodole D","protein production","\u03BCg","EC50","protein secretion","Th17 cell model","Conclusions Indole alkaloids","luciferase reporter assay","Jukat cells","gene expressions","structures of isolates","traditional fermentation process","famous traditional Chinese medicine","gels","column chromatography","IR spectra","dose-dependent manner","various clinical inflammatory diseases","RP","UV","size exclusion resin","NMR","indigodoles","ulcerative colitis","lead drugs development","possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles","methods Silica","psoriasis","investigation","indirubin","optical rotation","Materials","pure compounds","tryptanthrin","cytotoxicity","Strobilanthes cusia","Results","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods We screened 993 respiratory samples for HBoV by PCR among hospitalized children with SARI between September 2007 and March 2014. Four of HBoV1 samples were selected for complete genomes analysis by next-generation sequencing. Results The results show that 200 (20.1%) out of 993 samples were HBoV-positive, most of these HBoV belong to HBoV1 subtype (n = 197), HBoV2 (n = 1) and HBoV3 (n = 2) were also detected. Fifty (5.04%) of 993 SARI patient were detected as HBoV-positive only. Four HBoV1 genomes in this study were conserved and showed no significant difference among the nucleotide diversity from different regions. Analyses of evolutionary rates showed that NS1 exhibited the highest degree of conservation while the VP1 gene exhibited the fastest rate of evolution at 4.20 \u00D7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year. The nucleotide deletions and substitutions occurred in NP1 and VP1 represented novel molecular signatures enabling subtype differentiation between HBoVs.

The risk of infection and disease in an animal or animal population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host and host population, and behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Epidemiology, which is part of the science of population biology, attempts to meld these factors into a unified population-based perspective. The word epidemiology is widely used now no matter what host is concerned; the words endemic, epidemic, and pandemic are used to characterize disease states in human populations, and enzootic, epizootic, and panzootic are their equivalents in animal populations. By introducing quantitative measurements of disease trends, epidemiology has come to have a major role in advancing our understanding of the nature of diseases and in alerting and directing disease-control activities. Epidemiologic study is also effective in clarifying the role of viruses in the etiology of diseases, in understanding the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, in determining factors affecting host susceptibility, in unraveling modes of transmission, and in large-scale testing of vaccines and drugs. The case definition is a critical component of rates and proportions that should be standardized to allow comparison of disease occurrence in different populations and subpopulations. Criteria can be specified for confirmed, probable, and possible cases, depending on whether the selected criteria are pathognomonic for the viral disease of interest and whether laboratory results are available for all cases. Different case definitions can be specified at the individual animal and at the aggregate level.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Fenner\u0027s Veterinary Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751584000067; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751584000067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host population","viral disease","disease states","animal populations","environmental determinants of disease","comparison of disease occurrence","disease-control activities","host susceptibility","different populations","quantitative measurements of disease trends","human populations","individual animal","word epidemiology","ecological factors","virus transmission","distribution of diseases","science of population biology","nature of diseases","etiology of diseases","role of viruses","Publisher Summary Epidemiology","understanding","unified population-based perspective","Different case definitions","interaction of viruses","Epidemiologic study","possible cases","selected criteria","major role","unraveling modes of transmission","epizootic","enzootic","pandemic","panzootic","alerting","critical component of rates","laboratory results","large-scale testing of vaccines","words endemic","dynamics","equivalents","subpopulations","characteristics","drugs","proportions","epidemic","aggregate level","risk of infection","matter"],"language":"en"},

Here we focus on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alberti, Tommaso; Faranda, Davide","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fe441d86522a1868f681e618f6fddcb19329712.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10060v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemics peak","statistical predictions of COVID","real-time forecasts","available data","actual data","quality of data","results","long term extrapolation of epidemics counts","epidemic evolution of total COVID","statistical models","epidemic growth","large uncertainties","needs of compiling high-quality datasets of infections","real-time epidemiological projections","wide uncertainty ranges","fits of dynamical","Chinese provinces","fitting asymptotic distributions","early stages","Italian regions","non-linear nature","underlying dynamics","capabilities","regional level","asymptomatic patients","extreme care","delay","spread","virus","globe","case","Differences"],"language":"en"},

World Health Organization (WHO) was identified it as a global epidemic. Consensus occurred in the opinion that using Computerized Tomography (CT) techniques for early diagnosis of pandemic disease gives both fast and accurate results. It was stated by expert radiologists that COVID-19 displays different behaviours in CT images. In this study, a novel method was proposed as fusing and ranking deep features to detect COVID-19 in early phase. 16x16 (Subset-1) and 32x32 (Subset-2) patches were obtained from 150 CT images to generate sub-datasets.

These models, therefore, have significant influence on risk of societal harms.

When making claims about risk in safety-critical systems, it is common practice to produce an assurance case, which is a structured argument supported by evidence with the aim to assess how confident we should be in our risk-based decisions. We argue that any COVID-19 simulation model that is used to guide critical policy decisions would benefit from being supported with such a case to explain how, and to what extent, the evidence from the simulation can be relied on to substantiate policy conclusions.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carcione, Jose\u0027 M.; Santos, Juan E.; Bagaini, Claudio; Ba, Jing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/025d51d307167a6adb9ac83d76629ce4572bb803.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03575v10.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR","IFR"],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["infected individuals","exposed individuals","number of dead individuals","reported number of casualties","epidemic disease","infection fatality rate","days","times","IFR","higher incubation period","strong contagion rate","infected population","end","infection periods","infected people","basis of values","SEIR model","upper bounds","Northern Italy","wider range of lower","new coronavirus","knowledge","better fit","situation","date","reproduction ratio R0","Italian Region of Lombardy","rapid decrease","precise determination","parameters","predicted death toll","characteristics","different degrees of lockdown","constraints","literature","rates","case","example","peak"],"language":"en"},

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the US Department of Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA\u0027s stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehrotra, Sanjay; Rahimian, Hamed; Barah, Masoud; Luo, Fengqiao; Schantz, Karolina","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d787bd594ef5a64d465231012e04c7a6fdf41e43.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01318v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Federal Emergency Management Agency","FEMA","US Department of Homeland Security"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak demand","different states","available ventilator inventory","different times","patients","non-COVID","peak shortfall","allocation of ventilator inventory","different entities peaks","initial inventory","ventilator days","additional ventilators","total shortfall","severe demand scenario cases","pandemic","NY","critical resource","various degrees of shortfall","central agency","extreme case","stochastic optimization model","US Department of Homeland Security","Federal Emergency Management Agency","forecast confidence interval","average","FEMA\u0027s stockpile","risk-averse condition","quartile","paper","planning horizon","projected needs","results","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people\u0027s health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official bulletins and social media using Granger\u0027s causality showed that state bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also discussed. Our paper also introduces CoronaIndiaDataset2, the first social media based COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over 5.6 million national and 2.6 million state-level tweets.

This model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict the total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also given the opportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the simple diffusion model.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acioli, Paulo H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fda6079dc208546e3f7b6a7131bbdb66b2bca99.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11449v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exponential growth","simple diffusion model","diffusion constant","simple diffusion process","growth rate","Students","total number of cases","time series","function of time","population density","instructors","physics classroom","terms of mobility","COVID","mathematics","probability of transmission","models","parameters","manuscript","months","news","appearance","coronavirus","literature","infections","opportunity","pandemic","factors"],"language":"en"},

For droplet radii in the range 100 nm\u003CR\u003C60 {\\mu}m, evaporation can be described in the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion limited. Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate, the time-dependent droplet size and the sedimentation time, including the significant effect of evaporation cooling. Evaporation makes the time for large droplets to sediment much longer and thus significantly increases the viral air load. Using recent estimates for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sputum and droplet production rates while speaking, a single infected person that constantly speaks without a mouth cover produces a total air load of more than 10^4 virions. In a mid-size closed room, this leads to a viral inhalation frequency of at least 2.5 per minute.

In this context, there have been federal and state-level policy interventions aiming at mitigating the public health risks of this pandemic. These social distancing and work-from-home policies, which vary widely across states, have impacted the electricity sector, and economic productivity in general. As the U.S. begins to gradually resume some economic and social activities, it is imperative for policy makers and electric power operators to take a data-driven scientific approach to understanding and predicting the change of electricity consumption in the shorter and longer term. In this paper, we release a first-of-its-kind open access data hub, namely the Coronavirus Disease-Electricity Market Data Aggregation (COVID-EMDA), to track the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on electricity markets in the U.S. This ready-to-use data hub integrates generation, load and pricing data across all existing U.S. markets with COVID-19 case data, weather data, cellular phone location data and satellite imaging data into a compact format, and is updated daily to capture the evolving dynamics. Additionally, we perform rigorous statistical analysis of this data to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the electricity sector. Our analysis suggests a strong correlation between the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and a reduction in the total load, especially in the Northeast and Coastal regions of the U.S., which contains the majority of the U.S.COVID-19 case load. We also uncover significant spatial variations in the impact of COVID-19 on regional electricity markets, which may be indicative of differing social distancing policies and case loads.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruan, Guangchun; Wu, Dongqi; Zheng, Xiangtian; Sivaranjani, S.; Xie, Le; Zhong, Haiwang; Kang, Chongqing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bf758937cfee4a404b6335d21aba0130ebf8e3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06631v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

The outbreak of this disease has unsurprisingly led to huge volume of research within a short period of time surrounding this disease. It has also led to aggressive social media activity on twitter, Facebook, dedicated blogs, news reports and other online sites actively involved in discussing about the various aspects of and related to this disease. It becomes a useful and challenging exercise to draw from this huge volume of research, the key papers that form the research front, its influence in the research community, and other important research insights. Similarly, it becomes important to discern the key issues that influence the society concerning this disease. The paper is motivated by this. It attempts to distinguish which are the most influential papers, the key knowledge base and major topics surrounding the research covered by COVID-19. Further it attempts to capture the society\u0027s perception by discerning key topics that are trending online.

The Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, fractional-order operator is not local and consider the memory of the variables. Hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases growth.

A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yong; Yu, Xiangnan; Sun, HongGuang; Tick, Geoffrey R.; Wei, Wei; Jin, Bin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af9fa74295a96130db158a3e963623671a079286.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13901v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["China","United States","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["stochastic model","mitigating COVID","recovery dynamics of COVID","model results","time series of COVID","validated SEIR model","bimolecular reaction model","infection rate","recovery rates","evolution","China","spread","space dependent transmission","time-dependent Susceptible","infected people","maximum infected population","significant spatiotemporal variation","random walk particle tracking scheme","continuous improvement of screening techniques","Italy","intrinsic change","mixing","public hospital systems","Japan","United States","strict social distancing","high uncertainty","self-quarantine","non-pharmaceutical strategies","different countries","South Korea","various provinces","metropolises","lives","Preliminary tests","city lockdowns","predictions","coronavirus disease","pandemic","addition","months"],"language":"en"},

Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrong with a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio and mutation $h$-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is the most non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Phylogeography plays a major role in infectious disease surveillance, viral epidemiology and vaccine design. When conducting viral phylogeographic studies, researchers require the location of the infected host of the virus, which is often present in public databases such as GenBank. However, the geographic metadata in most GenBank records is not precise enough for many phylogeographic studies; therefore, researchers often need to search the articles linked to the records for more information, which can be a tedious process. Here, we describe two approaches for automatically detecting geographic location mentions in articles pertaining to virus-related GenBank records: a supervised sequence labeling approach with innovative features and a distant-supervision approach with novel noise- reduction methods. Evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard, our supervised sequence labeling and distant supervision approaches attained F-scores of 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.","publish_time":"2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weissenbacher, Davy; Sarker, Abeed; Tahsin, Tasnia; Scotch, Matthew; Gonzalez, Graciela","journal":"AMIA Jt Summits Transl Sci Proc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79b3b568e3410a49377a23263dc326927d54e187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5543364.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5543364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["researchers","virus-related GenBank records","viral phylogeographic studies","distant-supervision approach","supervised sequence labeling approach","distant supervision approaches","viral epidemiology","geographic location","articles","evolution of viral genetic sequences","geographic metadata","field of phylogeography","infectious disease surveillance","innovative features","spread","major role","novel noise- reduction methods","vaccine design","annotated gold standard","F-scores","infected host","public databases","information","tedious process"],"language":"en"},

Both proteins are presumably translated from a single subgenomic RNA. We have identified two translational strategies operating in pr12 gene expression. Internal initiation at the first and the second AUG codon of the pr12 coding sequence results in the synthesis of the 12K protein. In addition the protein is produced as a CP/12K transframe protein by ribosomal frameshifting. For these studies parts of the CP and pr12 coding sequences including the putative frameshift region were introduced into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase gene. Mutational analyses in conjunction with in vitro translation experiments identified a homopolymeric string of four adenosine nucleotides which together with a 3\u0027 flanking UGA stop codon were required for efficient frameshifting. The signal AAAAUGA is the first frameshift signal with a shifty stop codon to be analyzed in the eukaryotic system. Substitution of the four consecutive adenosine nucleotides by UUUU increased the efficiency of frameshifting, while substitution by GGGG or CCCC dramatically reduced the synthesis of the transframe protein. Also, UAA and UAG could replace the opal stop codon without effect on the frameshifting event, but mutation of UGA to the sense codon UGG inhibited transframe protein formation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting at the PVM signal is different from the one described by the \u0027simultaneous slippage\u0027 model in that only the string of four adenosine nucleotides represents the slippery sequence involved in a -1 P-site slippage.","publish_time":"1994-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gramstat, A; Pr\u00FCfer, D; Rohde, W","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVM RNA","UGA","UUUU","GGGG","CCCC","UAA","UAG","UGG","PVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["capsid protein CP","PVM signal","frameshifting event","efficiency of frameshifting","shifty stop codon","efficient frameshifting","sense codon UGG inhibited transframe protein formation","pr12 gene expression","mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting","frameshift signal","pr12 coding sequences","consecutive adenosine nucleotides","pr12 coding sequence results","synthesis","PVM RNA genome","signal AAAAUGA","Substitution","terminal gene cluster","beta-glucuronidase gene","mutation of UGA","homopolymeric string","flanking UGA","slippery sequence","internal position","Internal initiation","simultaneous slippage","putative frameshift region","single subgenomic RNA","P-site slippage","translation experiments","nucleic acid-binding","UUUU","conjunction","opal","translational strategies","GGGG","effect","potato virus","Mutational analyses","studies parts","model","CCCC","UAG","genes","UAA","findings","eukaryotic system","proteins","addition"],"language":"en"},

The signal, composed of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream pseudoknot, is similar in appearance to those identified in retroviral RNAs. We have examined whether the proposed BWYV signal functions in frameshifting in three translational systems, i.c. in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate or a wheat germ extract and in vivo in E. coli. The efficiency of the signal in the eukaryotic system is low but significant, as it responds strongly to changes in either the slip sequence or the pseudoknot. In contrast, in E. coli there is hardly any response to the same changes. Replacing the slip sequence to the typical prokaryotic signal AAAAAAG yields more than 5% frameshift in E. coli. In this organism the frameshifting is highly sensitive to changes in the slip sequence but only slightly to disruption of the pseudoknot. The eukaryotic assay systems are barely sensitive to changes in either AAAAAAG or in the pseudoknot structure in this construct. We conclude that eukaryotic frameshift signals are not recognized by prokaryotes. On the other hand the typical prokaryotic slip sequence AAAAAAG does not lead to significant frameshifting in the eukaryote. In contrast to recent reports on the closely related potato leafroll virus (PLRV) we show that the frameshifting in BWYV is pseudoknot-dependent.","publish_time":"1993-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia, A; van Duin, J; Pleij, C W","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC309131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BWYV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["changes","typical prokaryotic slip sequence AAAAAAG","typical prokaryotic signal AAAAAAG","significant frameshifting","downstream pseudoknot","pseudoknot structure","pseudoknot-dependent","coli","potential translational frameshift signal","proposed BWYV signal functions","heptanucleotide slippery sequence","eukaryotic frameshift signals","translational systems","eukaryotic assay systems","eukaryotic system","contrast","related potato leafroll virus","genomic RNA of beet western yellows virus","overlap region of open reading frames ORF2","appearance","PLRV","hand","wheat germ extract","reticulocyte lysate","recent reports","ORF3","disruption","retroviral RNAs","prokaryotes","construct","eukaryote","organism","response","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy, to guide the safe management of such patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mallick, R; Odejinmi, F; Clark, TJ","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b741ebc747e054216b184b572bbe130bb9d772bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","CO"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission of COVID","gynaecological procedures","confirmed COVID","patients","gynaecological laparoscopic surgery","worldwide impact of COVID","risks of SARS","viral transmission","cancer procedures","non-urgent cases","potential generation of SARS","countries","elective","experiences","China","creation of smoke","Italy","staffing","theatre staff","safe management","contaminated aerosols","use of energy devices","date evidence","leakage","resources","hospitals","aim","paper"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. RESULTS From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zainol Rashid, Z; Othman, S N; Abdul Samat, M N; Ali, U K; Wong, K K","journal":"The Malaysian journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of COVID","kits","IgG detection","RESULTS","performance data","IgG tests","Serology tests","diagnostic performance of rapid tests","rapid detection test","total antibody detection","IgM","serological assays","use of serology methods","immunochromatography principle","respiratory samples","plasma samples","world pandemic","preliminary data","specificity ranges","nucleic acid assays","separate test lines","Diagnosis of suspected cases","value of serological testing","World Health Organization","real-time PCR","various manufacturers","review of multiple reports","one-step method","appropriate interpretations","combination SARS-CoV","throat swab","RDT","colloidal gold","blood","serum","minutes","antibodies","INTRODUCTION","MATERIALS","outbreak","strengths","limitations","specific antigen","sensitivity","comprehensive evaluations","disease course","utility","monitoring","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, the elective surgical activity of the hospital was rapidly reduced and large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganised to admit and assist patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, the hospital became the regional referral hub for cardiovascular emergencies in order to keep ensuring a high level of health care to non-COVID-19 patients in northern Italy. In a few days, a COVID-19 emergency department was created, improving the general ward capacity to a total number of 279 beds dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds was increased from 28 to 72 (54 of them dedicated to patients with COVID-19, and 18 to cardiology and cardiac surgery hub emergencies), both converting pre-existing areas and creating new high technology spaces. All the involved health care personnel were rapidly trained to use personal protection equipment and to manage this particular category of patients both in general wards and ICUs.

The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies. The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020. OBJECTIVES To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented. RESULTS Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 \u00B1 20 years) males (65%). Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes. They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase. Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs. 12.9 vs. 9.8, P = 0.014). The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population. The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The mortality rate was 3.1. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system. We hope our findings will assist other providers and institutions in their care for these patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Itelman, Edward; Wasserstrum, Yishay; Segev, Amitai; Avaky, Chen; Negru, Liat; Cohen, Dor; Turpashvili, Natia; Anani, Sapir; Zilber, Eyal; Lasman, Nir; Athamna, Ahlam; Segal, Omer; Halevy, Tom; Sabiner, Yehuda; Donin, Yair; Abraham, Lital; Berdugo, Elisheva; Zarka, Adi; Greidinger, Dahlia; Agbaria, Muhamad; Kitany, Noor; Katorza, Eldad; Shenhav-Saltzman, Gilat; Segal, Gad","journal":"The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation","Sheba Medical Center"],"locations":["China","Israel"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","severe COVID","CONCLUSIONS COVID","rate of immune compromised patients","medical systems","severe disease","Sheba Medical Center","rate of deterioration","patient cohort","findings","virus","mortality rate","Israel","higher white blood cell counts","higher prevalence of arterial hypertension","largest center","clinical condition","absolute neutrophil counts","Low folic acid blood levels","havoc","healthcare professionals","cluster of pneumonia cases","paralyzing global economies","mean age","Wuhan","epidemiological data","cause","lactate dehydrogenase","diabetes","experiences","institutions","challenge","current analysis","World Health Organisation","years","China","providers","laboratory","METHODS","non-invasive oxygenation","hospitalization","OBJECTIVES","general population","males","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Reactivation of HBV refers to an increase in the HBV load caused by chemotherapy in a patient with HBV infection. Reactivation of HBV is classified into 2 categories: reactivation in a carrier and reactivation in a patient with resolved HBV infection. Because hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation is more likely to become severe and makes the treatment of original diseases difficult, it is most important to prevent the onset of hepatitis. The basic strategy for prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation associated with powerful chemotherapy regimens should follow the guidelines for the management of hepatitis B virus infection by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Risk of HBV reactivation is determined by HBV infection status and the degree of immunosuppression. HBV infection status is classified into chronic active hepatitis, inactive carrier, and resolved infection. This corresponds, in descending order, to the risk of reactivation. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection. HBsAg levels should be measured in all patients prior to commencement of treatment. In HBsAg-positive patients, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody, and HBV DNA levels should also be measured. In HBsAg-negative patients, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be measured. The next step for patients with resolved HBV infection is measurement of HBV DNA levels. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is 20 IU/mL or higher, as in inactive carriers, prophylactic therapy should be commenced before chemotherapy. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is less than 20 IU/mL, periodic monitoring of HBV DNA should be performed during and after chemotherapy. Preemptive therapy should be started immediately if the HBV DNA level ex- ceeds 20 IU/mL.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takikawa, Hajime","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho.

METHOD A retrospective, descriptive study of prospectively collected data in the Midland Trauma Registry in New Zealand. RESULTS Overall there was a reduction of 43% in all injury-related admissions with significant reductions seen in major injury (50% reduction), males (50% reduction) and children aged 0-14 years (48% reduction). Results for ethnicity and persons aged over 14 years were within 3% deviation of this overall 43% reduction. Injuries at home, particularly falls, predominate. CONCLUSION Despite the significant reduction in admissions during level 4 lockdown, hospitals should continue to provide full services until resource limitations are unavoidable. Immediate messaging is recommended to reduce rates of injury on the farm and at home, specifically falls prevention. Ongoing attention of road users to road safety is essential to reduce the incidence of preventable major injury.

This infection, which was declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, is particularly dangerous for dialysis patients, as they are frail and more vulnerable to infections due to the overlap of multiple pathologies. In patients with full-blown symptoms, there is a renal impairment of various degrees in 100% of the subjects observed. However, as Covid-19 is an emerging disease, more work is needed to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies. It is essential to avoid nosocomial spread; in order to control and reduce the rate of infections it is necessary to strengthen the management of medical and nursing personnel through the early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of patients undergoing dialysis treatment. We cover here a series of recommendations for the treatment of dialysis patients who are negative to the virus, and of those who are suspected or confirmed positive.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brioni, Elena; Leopaldi, Donato; Magnaghi, Cristiano; Franchetti, Rosalia; Granellini, Elisa; Pegoraro, Marisa; Gambirasio, Maria Cristina; Mazzacani, Paolo; Parisotto, Maria Teresa","journal":"Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of patients","treatment of dialysis patients","dialysis treatment","treatment strategies","Covid","early diagnosis","full-blown symptoms","rate of infections","emerging disease","acute respiratory distress syndrome","pneumonia","sepsis","myalgia","fatigue","isolation","nursing personnel","severe cases","World Health Organization","fever","global epidemic","management of medical","septic shock","variability of flu","renal impairment of various degrees","new coronavirus","cough","prevention","nosocomial spread","order","overlap of multiple pathologies","work","series of recommendations","subjects","death"],"language":"en"},

It is now possible to perform many laparoscopic gynecologic surgeries with minimal to no visible scars. This article reviews the use of 3mm ports and several reduced-port and single-port techniques for use in gynecologic surgery as well as vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES). We also discuss the advantages and challenges that physicians face regarding the adoption of these procedures into general practice. Lastly, we present our novel economic adaption in approach to reduced-port laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy versus traditional single-site laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy.

Design Case series of 73 patients. Setting Large tertiary hospital in Milan. Participants Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 20 February and 2 April 2020. Main outcome measures Demographic and daily clinical data were collected to identify predictors of early mortality. Results Of the 73 patients included in the study, most were male (83.6%), the median age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-69 years), and hypertension affected 52.9% of patients. Lymphocytopenia (median, 0.77 x 103 per mm3 ; IQR, 0.58-1.00 x 103 per mm3), hyperinflammation with C-reactive protein (median, 184.5 mg/dL; IQR, 108.2-269.1 mg/dL) and pro-coagulant status with D-dimer (median, 10.1 \u03BCg/m; IQR, 5.0-23.8 \u03BCg/m) were present. Median tidal volume was 6.7 mL/kg (IQR, 6.0-7.5 mL/kg), and median positive end-expiratory pressure was 12 cmH2O (IQR, 10-14 cmH2O). In the first 3 days, prone positioning (12-16 h) was used in 63.8% of patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in five patients (6.8%). After a median follow-up of 19.0 days (IQR, 15.0-27.0 days), 17 patients (23.3%) had died, 23 (31.5%) had been discharged from the ICU, and 33 (45.2%) were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22; P = 0.004) and hypertension (OR, 6.15; 95% CI, 1.75-29.11; P = 0.009) were associated with mortality, while early improvement in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio was associated with being discharged alive from the ICU (P = 0.002 for interaction). Conclusions Despite multiple advanced critical care interventions, COVID-19 ARDS was associated with prolonged ventilation and high short term mortality.

In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one\u0027s medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shelef, Leah; Schiff, Miriam; Zalsman, Gil","journal":"Harefuah","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical teams","medical condition","medical unit","medical staff","social support","risk factors","mental health","pandemic outbreak","psychological impact","mental symptoms","long-term impact","risk of contagion","protective factors","outbreak of COVID","up-to-date professional literature","World Health Organization","work-related risks","good team-spirit","depression","altruistic acceptance","infection","anxiety","enormous burden","superiors","negative perception","patients","quarantine","epidemics","isolation","present study","means of protection","stress","group","post-trauma","international emergency","Direct exposure","aim","evidence","importance","sense of control","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

The cleavage site was mapped by site directed mutagenesis between residues Asp-154 and Ala-155 of the muNS sequence. Although muNS and muNSC, but not muNSN, are able to form inclusions when expressed individually in transfected cells, only muNS is able to recruit specific ARV proteins to these structures. Furthermore, muNSC associates with ARV factories more weakly than muNS, sigmaNS and lambdaA. Finally, the inhibition of caspase activity in ARV-infected cells does not diminish ARV gene expression and replication, but drastically reduces muNS processing and the release and dissemination of progeny viral particles.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez-Grille, Javier; Busch, Lisa K.; Mart\u00EDnez-Costas, Jos\u00E9; Benavente, Javier","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/048e695fd08b58882554c0b6260cf8caa47c6528.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112042.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.04.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214002244; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214002244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["muNS processing","muNS sequence","ARV-infected cells","ARV factories","Abstract Avian reovirus non-structural protein muNS","transfected cells","ARV gene expression","specific ARV proteins","muNSC associates","termed muNSC","kDa carboxyterminal protein","infected chicken embryo fibroblast cells","course of avian reovirus infection","designated muNSN","cleavage site","kDa aminoterminal polypeptide","inhibition of caspase activity","release","replication","dissemination of progeny viral particles","residues Asp","mutagenesis","Ala","sigmaNS","inclusions","structures","protease","lambdaA","study"],"language":"en"},

We explored the relationship between polymorphisms and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) incidence with variables. We used a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, which is an expansion of logistic regression, for each type of steroid, primary disease, drug dose, applied duration, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers. There were significant correlations between the ABCB1 rs1045642 mutant and SONFH in the prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisone-use populations. The ABCB1 rs2032582 mutant homozygote had a protective effect in the methylprednisolone/prednisolone renal transplant population. For ApoB rs693, mutation increased the incidence of SONFH in prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisolone-use populations and renal transplant patients.

Redox signaling is a critical component of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and variety of other physiological functions. Early studies demonstrated that PRDXs regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of several cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress and antioxidant systems are important regulators of redox signaling regulated diseases. In addition, thiol-based redox systems through peroxiredoxins have been demonstrated to regulate several redox-dependent process related diseases. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding PRDXs in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting PRDXs. Moreover, we will suggest that PRDXs could be targets of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting PRDXs may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases.

The data shown indicate that upon intraperitoneal immunization with Cry1Ac, significant intestinal specific IgG cell responses were produced in the lamina propria, accompanied by an increased frequency of intestinal IgG\u002B lymphocytes and epithelial cells containing IgG. Considering that FcRn is the receptor responsible for the transport of IgG in neonatal intestinal epithelia, but it is developmentally downregulated in the rodent intestine, we analysed whether upon intestinal IgG induction, FcRn mRNA expression was induced in intestinal epithelial cells, of adult mice. Whereas in intestinal epithelia of unimmunized adult mice FcRn mRNA was not detected, in Cry1Ac immunized mice it was expressed, although the level was lower in comparison with that found in neonatal epithelia. Then using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence we confirmed that the expression of the protein FcRn was induced in the intestines of adult immunized mice especially in the large intestine. Finally, we found that Cry1Ac also increased FcRn expression in isolated intestinal epithelial cells stimulated in vitro. The outcomes suggest that the expression of FcRn in intestinal epithelium might be reactivated upon immunization, and possibly facilitate IgG transport.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verdin\u2010Ter\u00E1n, S.

To determine the origination and evolution of this isolated strain, we have carried out a complete genome sequencing of this strain. The genome of the ck/CH/IBTZ/2012 strain is 27,691 nucleotides in length and includes more than 10 open reading frames. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genomic sequences showed that ck/CH/IBTZ/2012 is mostly related to the LX4-like strains. However, sequence analysis based on the spike protein (S) gene sequences revealed that ck/CH/IBTZ/2012 possesses a distinct S gene setting it apart from the Massachusetts-type strains and LX4-type strains. The cleavage site within the spike protein (S) of ck/CH/IBTZ/2012 is HRRKR, which is different from the majority of the IBVs in China for their cleavage sits are HRRRR. Recombination analysis showed that ck/CH/IBTZ/2012 is a chimeric virus with a LX4-like backbone except S gene which might be from an unknown strain. Based on the data presented in this paper, it can be concluded that genetic changes due to adaptive evolution and recombination both contributed to the origin of strain ck/CH/IBTZ/2012, which belongs to a new genotype.

METHODS: Two inactive \u03B2-lactamase deletion fragments, bla(a) and bla(b), were fused to \u03B2-arrestin and GPCR, respectively. A stable cell line named HEK/293-\u03B22a2, which expressed two fusion proteins, GPCR/bla(b) and \u03B2-arrestin2/bla(a), was generated under antibiotic selection. A natural compound library of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fractionated samples from the ethanol extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs was used for high-throughput screening (HTS) of \u03B22-adrenoceptor (\u03B22AR) agonists against the cell line HEK/293-\u03B22a2. The interested hits were validated by the measurement of second-messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. RESULTS: The stable cell line HEK/293-\u03B22a2 responded to \u03B22AR agonist/antagonist in a dose-dependent manner. The EC(50) value obtained for isoproterenol was 15.5 nmol/L, and the IC(50) value obtained for propranolol was 51.9 nmol/L. Furthermore, HTS was performed to identify \u03B22AR agonists from the natural compound library we established. The Z\u2032 factor value was determined to be 0.68.

The urinary antigen test (UAT) is known to be useful for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of UAT in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) era. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases aged \u226519 years were reviewed retrospectively. This study evaluated the utility of Streptococcus pneumoniae UAT (BinaxNOW\u00AE assay) for diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP, and the relation of the UAT positive rate to age, comorbidities, pneumonia severity, and pneumococcal serotypes. Among 752 microbiologically identified CAP cases, S. pneumoniae (36.7%) was the most common isolate, and of those cases, 56.4% were positive for UAT. UAT positivity varied by pneumococcal serotype (serotype 3, 50%; 9V/9A, 85%; 11A/11E, 54%; 14, 36.4%; 19A, 50%; and 23F, 37.5%), and was significantly increased since 2012, two years after introduction of PCV13. The positive rate of UAT was significantly related to CRP level (P = 0.007) and lobar pneumonia (P = 0.006), but not to age, co-morbidities or prior antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, urinary antigen detection varied depending on the S. pneumoniae serotype. In the PCV13 era, the serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia may be changing, and the clinical usefulness of UAT needs to be monitored. The positive rate of UAT may be influenced by a localized bacterial burden and host reactions.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Min Joo; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Jeon, Ji Ho; Kang, Seong Hui; Jung, Eun Ju; Noh, Ji Yun; Kim, Woo Joo","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/924b87047028e1e55df1b901323bd03fb19e7d3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128949.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2015.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26212866/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X15001427; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X15001427","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["UAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UAT positive rate","positive rate of UAT","UAT positivity","serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia","diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP","pneumococcal serotypes","clinical usefulness of UAT","Abstract Early diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia","pneumonia severity","lobar pneumonia","utility of Streptococcus pneumoniae UAT","pneumoniae serotype","CAP cases","valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine","PCV13 era","age","introduction of PCV13","study","years","appropriate antibiotic therapy","prior antibiotic therapy","urinary antigen detection","urinary antigen test","assay","comorbidities","BinaxNOW","co-morbidities","relation","localized bacterial burden","host reactions","conclusion","CRP level","common isolate","Community"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Twenty-four patients hospitalized with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia at our hospital between September 2009 and January 2010 were included. The patients underwent thin-section CT 3 years after recovery. Abnormal pulmonary lesion patterns (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, parenchymal bands, air trapping, and reticulation) and evidence of fibrosis (architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing) were evaluated on follow-up thin-section CT. Patients were assigned to Group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and Group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Demographics, rate of mechanical ventilation therapy, rate of intensive care unit admission, cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose, laboratory tests results (maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine kinase [CK]), and peak radiographic opacification of 24 patients during the course of their illness in the hospital were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was present in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients and fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients. Patients in Group 1 (10/24; 41.7%) had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation therapy (Z = \u22122.340, P = 0.019), higher number of doses of cumulative prednisolone-equivalent (Z = \u22122.579, P = 0.010), higher maximum level of laboratory tests results (AST [Z = \u22122.140, P = 0.032], LDH [Z = \u22123.227, P = 0.001], and CK [Z = \u22123.345, P = 0.019]), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (Z = \u22122.743, P = 0.006) than patients in group 2 (14/24; 58.3%). CONCLUSIONS: H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia frequently is followed by long-term pulmonary sequelae, including fibrotic changes, in lung parenchyma. Patients who need more steroid therapy, need more mechanical ventilation therapy, had higher laboratory tests results (maximum levels of AST, LDH, and CK), and had higher peak opacification on chest radiographs during treatment are more likely to develop lung fibrosis.","publish_time":"2015-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Zhi-Heng; Sun, Xin; Xu, Long; Wu, Qi; Li, Li; Wu, Xian-Jie; Shao, Xu-Guang; Zhao, Xin-Qian; Wang, Jing-Hua; Ma, Long-Yan; Wang, Kai","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d24afd9ee025b53015824be203db539009964fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4834006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25836610/; https://doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.154285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","pulmonary fibrosis","CT evidence of fibrosis","higher laboratory tests results","higher peak opacification","lung fibrosis","higher rate of mechanical ventilation therapy","section CT","higher maximum level of laboratory tests results","H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia","LDH","maximum levels of AST","higher number of doses","long-term pulmonary sequelae","steroid therapy","peak radiographic opacification","chest radiographs","years","hospital","maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase","cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose","Abnormal pulmonary lesion patterns","parenchymal bands","Parenchymal abnormality","lung parenchyma","rate of intensive care unit admission","ground-glass opacity","consolidation","aspartate transaminase","fibrotic changes","paired inspiration-expiration","treatment","air trapping","architectural distortion","traction bronchiectasis","lactate dehydrogenase","research","reticulation","scans","tomography","influenza","honeycombing","course","CONCLUSIONS","Demographics","creatine kinase","affecting factors","illness","follow-up","recovery","BACKGROUND","aim","METHODS","groups"],"language":"en"},

During the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells, the miR-27b is notably down-regulated. Thus, we speculate that miR-27b is involved in regulating the process of apoptosis in PK-15 cells. In this study we demonstrated that the over-expression of miR-27b led to the inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis, reduction of Bax protein level, and decrease of caspase-3 and \u22129 activities. Conversely, silencing of miR-27b by miR-27b inhibitors enhanced apoptosis via up-regulating Bax expression and promoting the activities of caspase-3 and \u22129 in TGEV-infected cells. Subsequently, the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a candidate target of miR-27b predicted by bioinformatics search. We further identified that the miR-27b directly bound to the 3\u2032 UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and suppressed RUNX1 expression, which indicates RUNX1 is the direct target gene of miR-27b. The over-expression of RUNX1 increased apoptosis and knockdown RUNX1blocked apoptosis of viral-infected cells via regulating Bax expression and the activities of caspase-3 and \u22129. Our data reveal that miR-27b may repress the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, indicating that TGEV may induce apoptosis via down-regulating miR-27b and that miR-27b may act as a target for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2016-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaomin; Song, Xiangjun; Bai, Xiaoyuan; Fei, Naijiao; Huang, Yong; Zhao, Zhimin; Du, Qian; Zhang, Hongling; Zhang, Liang; Tong, Dewen","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b7a343a9ffffc005daf8a962cf9140f5dc8735.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4748701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26870610/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced apoptosis","over-expression of miR","silencing of miR","process of apoptosis","b inhibitors","candidate target of miR","over-expression of RUNX1 increased apoptosis","suppressed RUNX1 expression","Bax expression","direct target gene of miR","mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis","TGEV-infected cells","knockdown RUNX1blocked apoptosis of viral","TGEV infection","inhibition of TGEV","activities of caspase","UTR of RUNX1 mRNA","PK","key cause","reduction of Bax protein level","key role","regulation of virus","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","fatal diarrhea of piglets","results","runt-related transcription factor","coronaviridae family","pathological processes","miRNAs","bioinformatics search","microRNAs","therapeutic intervention","study","data"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine the epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics that distinguished cases of MERS contracted during outbreaks from those contracted sporadically (ie, non-outbreak) between 2012 and 2015 in Saudi Arabia. DESIGN: Data from the Saudi Ministry of Health of confirmed outbreak and non-outbreak cases of MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections from September 2012 through October 2015 were abstracted and analysed. Univariate and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and the time between disease onset and confirmation, onset and notification and onset and death were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1250 patients (aged 0\u2013109 years; mean, 50.825 years) were reported infected with MERS-CoV. Approximately two-thirds of all MERS cases were diagnosed in men for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Healthcare workers comprised 22% of all MERS cases for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Nosocomial infections comprised one-third of all Saudi MERS cases; however, nosocomial infections occurred more frequently in outbreak than non-outbreak cases (p\u003C0.001). Patients contracting MERS during an outbreak were significantly more likely to die of MERS (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To date, nosocomial infections have fuelled MERS outbreaks.

The types of infections that occur in PIDD patients are largely dictated by the nature of the immune deficiency, which can be defined by dysfunction of cellular or humoral defenses. An increasing number of PIDDs, including those with both cellular and humoral defects, have antibody deficiency as a major feature and can benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy as a result. In fact, the most common PIDDs worldwide are antibody deficiencies and include common variable immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper IgM syndrome, specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of these conditions, a thorough understanding of the specific infections for which these patients are at increased risk can hasten diagnosis and guide additional therapies. Moreover, the infection trends in some PIDD patients with profound defects of cellular immunity, such as autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (Job\u2019s/Buckley\u2019s Syndrome) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggest that select patients might benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy even if their immune deficiency is not limited to antibody defects.

The first 2\u20135 patients with ARIs were recruited in each hospital weekly from 2012 through 2015. The presence of respiratory viruses was screened by PCR assays. The prevalence of respiratory viruses was determined and compared between patients at different hospital settings. RESULTS: A total of 3487 hospitalized cases and 6437 outpatients/Emergency Department (ED) patients were enrolled. The most commonly detected viruses in the hospitalized cases were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 33.3%) in children less than two years old, adenoviruses (13.0%) in patients 15\u201334 years old, and influenza viruses (IFVs, 9.6%) in patients \u226565 years.

After controlling for the confounders caused by other viruses and covariates, adenoviruses (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.97, 99% confidence interval [99% CI]: 2.19\u20137.20) and RSV (aOR: 2.04, 99% CI: 1.34\u20133.11) were independently associated with increased hospitalization in children, as well as adenoviruses in adults (aOR: 2.14, 99% CI: 1.19\u20133.85). Additionally, co-infection of RSV with IFVs was associated with increased hospitalization in children (aOR: 12.20, 99% CI: 2.65\u201356.18). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of ARIs was associated with respiratory viruses in North China. RSV, adenoviruses, and co-infection of RSV and IFVs were more frequent in hospitalized children (or adenoviruses in adults), which might predict the severity of ARIs. Attending clinicians should be more vigilant of these infections.

To control spread and finally contain novel viruses, rapid identification and subsequent isolation of infected individuals and their contacts is of utmost importance. Next to methods for nucleic acid detection, validated serological assays are particularly important as the timeframe for antibody detection is less restricted. During the SARS-CoV epidemic a wide variety of serological diagnostic assays were established using multiple methods as well as different viral antigens. Even though the majority of the developed assays showed high sensitivity and specificity, numerous studies reported on cross-reactive antibodies to antigens from wide-spread common cold associated CoVs. In order to improve preparedness and responsiveness during future outbreaks of novel CoVs, information and problems regarding serological diagnosis that occurred during the SARS-CoV should be acknowledged. In this review we summarize the performance of different serological assays as well as the applicability of the two main applied antigens (spike and nucleocapsid protein) used during the SARS-CoV outbreak. We highlight challenges and potential pitfalls that occur when dealing with a novel emerging coronavirus like MERS-CoV. In addition we describe problems that might occur when animal sera are tested in serological assays for the identification of putative reservoirs. Finally, we give a recommendation for a serological testing scheme and outline necessary improvements that should be implemented for a better preparedness.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Benjamin; Drosten, Christian; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25c6b4df1a8e44244505536d61cf436e8bd75753.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114385.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670324/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214001257; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214001257","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV epidemic","SARS-CoV outbreak","performance of different serological assays","serological diagnosis","CoV challenges researchers","wide variety of serological diagnostic assays","developed assays","serological testing scheme","novel viruses","novel emerging coronavirus","future outbreaks of novel CoVs","different viral antigens","problems","spread","main applied antigens","Middle East respiratory syndrome","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","rapid identification","multiple methods","antibody detection","better preparedness","nucleic acid detection","identification of putative reservoirs","common cold associated CoVs","specificity","information","numerous studies","subsequent isolation of infected individuals","high sensitivity","responsiveness","cross-reactive antibodies","nucleocapsid protein","public health authorities","contacts","spike","timeframe","applicability","decade","necessary improvements","animal sera","occurrence","majority","recommendation","utmost importance","potential pitfalls","order","review","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital from January 2009 to March 2013. Study subjects included adults (aged \u226518 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had undergone laboratory tests for RVI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, defined as severity with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score \u226591. RESULTS: In total, 191 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were included for analysis and stratified into 2 groups: the severe group with a PSI score \u226591 (n = 99) and the non-severe group with a PSI score \u003C91 (n = 92). Preceding RVIs were detected in 48 patients, including influenza A virus (n = 20), influenza B virus (n = 4), parainfluenza viruses (n = 5), metapneumovirus (n = 4), rhinovirus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial viruses (n = 6), coronaviruses (n = 2), and mixed viral infections (n = 3).

As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the device, a proof of concept study consisting of $N=2$ runners performing a set of $5km$ running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the likelihood of suffering from RRIs.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manero, R.

The bottleneck will get worse by a factor of 20 (or more) once LSST comes on line. We need to fundamentally rethink the purpose of surveys for transients. Here, after undertaking a detailed investigation of this issue I offer some solutions. Going forward, astronomers will employ two different methodologies: (1) multi-band photometric method which is well suited to the study of very large, many tens of thousands, samples of faint transients; (2) spectral classifications of thousands of bright transients found in shallow and nightly cadenced wide-field photometry surveys and transients associated with galaxies in the local Universe. The latter program, in addition to unearthing new types of transients and offering astronomers opportunities to undertake extensive follow up of interesting transients, is needed to set the stage for the former. Specifically, I suggest a globally coordinated effort to spectrally classify a complete sample of bright supernovae (\u003C~19.5 mag) and transients within the local Universe (\u003C200 Mpc) The proposed program is within reach -- thanks to the on-going wide-field surveys, the development of novel spectrographs tuned for classification, great improvements in throughput of spectrographs and the increasing availability of robotic telescopes.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kulkarni, S.

This work proposes to treat automatic image meme generation as a translation process, and further present an end to end neural and probabilistic approach to generate an image-based meme for any given sentence using an encoder-decoder architecture. For a given input sentence, an image meme is generated by combining a meme template image and a text caption where the meme template image is selected from a set of popular candidates using a selection module, and the meme caption is generated by an encoder-decoder model. An encoder is used to map the selected meme template and the input sentence into a meme embedding and a decoder is used to decode the meme caption from the meme embedding. The generated natural language meme caption is conditioned on the input sentence and the selected meme template. The model learns the dependencies between the meme captions and the meme template images and generates new memes using the learned dependencies. The quality of the generated captions and the generated memes is evaluated through both automated and human evaluation. An experiment is designed to score how well the generated memes can represent the tweets from Twitter conversations. Experiments on Twitter data show the efficacy of the model in generating memes for sentences in online social interaction.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sadasivam, Aadhavan; Gunasekar, Kausic; Davulcu, Hasan; Yang, Yezhou","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62be11d830d59193c754c9e3ca5760c7dd6f089c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14571v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["meme captions","selected meme template","image-based meme","meme template images","automatic image meme generation","Image memes","generated memes","generated natural language meme caption","generated captions","given sentence","given input sentence","new memes","encoder-decoder model","text caption","encoder-decoder architecture","social media","Twitter data","social interaction","learned dependencies","Twitter conversations","selection module","blogs","efficacy","translation process","probabilistic approach","set of popular candidates","ideas","widespread tool","sentences","tweets","open messengers","people","Experiments","work","human evaluation","quality"],"language":"en"},

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves\u003E85% and\u003E90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirano, Hokuto; Koga, Kazuki; Takemoto, Kazuhiro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b66bea6b669148ec4cf5c498b59cc46bdd1e7c4d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11061v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nontargeted UAPs","COVID","vulnerability of DNN","representative DNN models","DNN failure","chest X-ray images","case of small UAPs","cases","targeted attacks","chest X-ray computed tomography imaging","need","input","based systems","results","screening","practical applications of DNNs","single perturbation","aided systems","iterative fine-tuning","average norm","task failure","image dataset","specific class","universal adversarial perturbation","given target class","simple iterative algorithms","deep neural networks","robustness","careful consideration","novel coronavirus disease","incorrect label","development of computer","success rates","epidemic","strategies","security concerns","expert radiologists","UPAs","classification tasks","diagnosis","number","bottleneck","example","patients"],"language":"en"},

Models for the transmission dynamics of rotavirus are critical both for estimating current burden from imperfect surveillance and for assessing potential effects of vaccine intervention strategies.

Additionally, a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the proportion of children with diarrhea who consulted at a health structure. Model fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model; thus, where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology an ensemble approach can account for that uncertainty. We compare our results across several variants of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates. Model-specific parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We then use Bayesian model averaging to generate ensemble estimates of the current dynamics, including estimates of $R_0$, the burden of infection in the region, as well as the impact of vaccination on both the short-term dynamics and the long-term reduction of rotavirus incidence under varying levels of coverage.

Many countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks\u0027 lockdown and are extending the period depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year later but on a lesser magnitude.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Sarmistha; Ghosh, Pramit; Sen, Bandana; Mukhopadhyay, Indranil","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1d3c14efa34936e72cfba581948293e4bbe69ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03126v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartlett"],"organizations":["SEIR","CCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ideal number of lockdown days","weeks\u0027 lockdown","CCS","infection","period of TTE days","disease dynamics","smaller lockdown phase","total number of susceptible population","country-specific expected time","country-specific estimate","size of quarantined population","day period of estimated communicability of COVID","SEIR model","current disease scenario","fixed time","certain threshold","given country-wise rates of death","Critical Community Size","extinction","recovery","year","Background","Restrictive mass quarantine","rise","place","small communities","important controlling measure","outbreak","cautionary note","lesser magnitude","parameters","Methods","Findings","countries","decision","Bartlett"],"language":"en"},

For low overall infection levels in the population, pooling of samples can drastically amplify the testing efficiency. Here we present a formula to estimate the optimal pooling size, the efficiency gain (tested persons per test), and the expected upper bound of missed infections in the pooled testing, all as a function of the populationwide infection levels and the false negative/positive rates of the currently used PCR tests. Assuming an infection level of 0.1 % and a false negative rate of 2 %, the optimal pool size is about 32, the efficiency gain is about 15 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 1 % the optimal pool size is 11, the efficiency gain is 5.1 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 10 % the optimal pool size reduces to about 4, the efficiency gain is about 1.7 tested persons per test. For infection levels of 30 % and higher there is no more benefit from pooling. To see to what extent replicates of the pooled tests improve the estimate of the maximal number of missed infections, we present all results for 1, 3, and 5 replicates.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanel, Rudolf; Thurner, Stefan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09944v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency gain","tested persons","optimal pooling size","optimal pool size","testing efficiency","populationwide infection levels","low overall infection levels","pooled tests","pooled testing","pooling of samples","estimate","maximal number of missed infections","acute shortage of tests","used PCR tests","false negative rate","expected upper bound of missed infections","extent replicates","national healthcare systems","positive rates","confirming SARS-CoV","current COVID19 crisis","function","results","formula","benefit"],"language":"en"},

By understanding the development trend of a regional epidemic, the epidemic can be controlled using the development policy. The common traditional mathematical differential equations and population prediction models have limitations for time series population prediction, and even have large estimation errors. To address this issue, we propose an improved method for predicting confirmed cases based on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) neural network. This work compared the deviation between the experimental results of the improved LSTM prediction model and the digital prediction models (such as Logistic and Hill equations) with the real data as reference. And this work uses the goodness of fitting to evaluate the fitting effect of the improvement.

Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system. However, few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments, in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens, and their conspecifics living in captivity. Wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens, but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations, suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species. Here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented. Importantly, the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations. Our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations, including total IgG and IgM, natural antibodies, and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas; there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas. The striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies, with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function, and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis.","publish_time":"2015-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flies, Andrew S.; Mansfield, Linda S.; Grant, Chris K.; Weldele, Mary L.; Holekamp, Kay E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5e971f5c6854bcf76a7963effbbd79e62becab0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4621877.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26444876/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild hyenas","captive hyenas","Wild spotted hyenas","wild population","captive environment","captive population of spotted hyenas","immune defenses","comparative studies of wild animals","immune function","wild hyena populations","natural savanna environment","vertebrate immune system","intensity of immune responses","natural antibodies","natural environments","Crocuta crocuta","striking differences","hygiene hypothesis","captivity","higher serum antibody concentrations","traditional immunology studies","myriad pathogens","pathogen control programs","wide array of potential pathogens","total IgG","induced mortality","proper development","duration","IgM","little evidence of disease","proximal mechanisms","bacterial killing capacity of sera","time","regulation","autoantibodies","links","onset","microbial exposure","immunological questions","progress","Evolutionary processes","conspecifics","species","testing","results","generations"],"language":"en"},

In humans, they are involved in transcription, X-chromosome inactivation, neurodegeneration and modulating PARP1 signalling, making them potential targets for therapeutic agents. Unfortunately, some aspects related to the substrate binding and catalysis of MacroD-like macrodomains still remain unclear, since mutation of the proposed catalytic aspartate does not completely abolish enzyme activity. Here, we present a functional and structural characterization of a macrodomain from the extremely halotolerant and alkaliphilic bacterium Oceanobacillus iheyensis (OiMacroD), related to hMacroD1/hMacroD2, shedding light on substrate binding and catalysis. The crystal structures of D40A, N30A and G37V mutants, and those with MES, ADPr and ADP bound, allowed us to identify five fixed water molecules that play a significant role in substrate binding. Closure of the \u03B26\u2013\u03B14 loop is revealed as essential not only for pyrophosphate recognition, but also for distal ribose orientation. In addition, a novel structural role for residue D40 is identified. Furthermore, it is revealed that OiMacroD not only catalyses the hydrolysis of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose but also reverses protein mono-ADP-ribosylation. Finally, mutant G37V supports the participation of a substrate-coordinated water molecule in catalysis that helps to select the proper substrate conformation.","publish_time":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zapata-P\u00E9rez, Rub\u00E9n; Gil-Ortiz, Fernando; Mart\u00EDnez-Mo\u00F1ino, Ana Bel\u00E9n; Garc\u00EDa-Saura, Antonio Gin\u00E9s; Juanhuix, Jordi; S\u00E1nchez-Ferrer, \u00C1lvaro","journal":"Open Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a49923d05f7decbdc6f0d8a3825fd2cfb6711775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5413906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446708/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160327","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["substrate binding","ADP-ribose","acetyl-ADP","proper substrate conformation","substrate-coordinated water molecule","catalysis of MacroD","protein mono-ADP","Macrodomains","OiMacroD","ADPr","novel structural role","distal ribose orientation","significant role","G37V mutants","structural characterization","mutant G37V","fixed water molecules","modulating PARP1 signalling","neurodegeneration","shedding light","potential targets","X-chromosome inactivation","alkaliphilic bacterium Oceanobacillus iheyensis","mutation","N30A","hMacroD2","participation","proposed catalytic aspartate","\u03B14 loop","transcription","crystal structures of D40A","hMacroD1","residue D40","hydrolysis of O","MES","ubiquitous conserved domains","pyrophosphate recognition","Closure","\u03B26","therapeutic agents","ribosylation","addition","metabolites","enzyme activity","aspects","humans"],"language":"en"},

Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs.

Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell. Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.

DESIGN: Experimental study to test effectiveness of personal protective equipment. METHODS: The nozzle of a spray gun was adjusted to angularly disperse a mist of colored dye that approximated a patient sneezing on a dimensionally accurate cardboard slit lamp model. We tested the designs of six commercially available breath shields, and one breath shield repurposed from a plastic container lid. Each breath shield was sprayed in a standardized fashion three times and the amount of overspray compared with no shield was quantified. The surface area that was sprayed was calculated using Adobe Photoshop\u2019s color range function. The average percentage of overspray of each breath shield was computed in comparison to the control. RESULTS: The breath shields ranged in surface area from 116-1254 cm(2) and the amount of overspray varied from 54% to virtually none. Larger breath shields offered better protection than smaller ones. Breath shields attached to the objective lens arm were a better barrier than those hung by the oculars of comparable size. A repurposed plastic lid breath shield was 513cm(2), was slightly curved toward the examiner\u2019s face, and allowed only 2% overspray. The largest breath shield (1254 cm(2)) hung near the oculars and prevented essentially all the overspray. CONCLUSION: The performance of different designs of breath shields is variable. Even high functioning shields should be used in conjunction with personal protective equipment including masks, goggles and gloves, and handwashing. Ideally patients should also wear a cloth mask during all slit lamp exams.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, John; Wang, Annie Y.; Ing, Edsel B.","journal":"Am J Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fc5451ad208c577bedaa833f62cb11956254c12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212996.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939420302348?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939420302348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Larger breath shields","available breath shields","largest breath shield","efficacy of slit lamp breath shields","repurposed plastic lid breath shield","performance of different designs of breath shields","high functioning shields","slit lamp exams","average percentage of overspray","surface area","accurate cardboard slit lamp model","effectiveness of personal protective equipment","plastic container lid","better protection","droplet spray","better barrier","spray gun","oculars of comparable size","goggles","masks","conjunction","patient sneezing","objective lens arm","cloth mask","Experimental study","smaller ones","Adobe Photoshop\u2019s color range function","gloves","mist of colored dye","standardized fashion","nozzle","simulated sneeze","CONCLUSION","times","comparison","handwashing","patients","METHODS","RESULTS","examiner\u2019s face","control"],"language":"en"},

However, no acute worsening of the respiratory status was found, determined as the presence of fever and upper respiratory symptoms or a recent change in at least two of the following: sputum volume or colour, cough intensity, increased malaise, increased dyspnea, loss of appetite, a decrease of FEV1 \u003E10% (modified Fuchs criteria). Conclusion In this pilot study chronic PA infection wasn\u0027t associated with a higher rate of viral detection and no immediate negative consequences of virus detection on the respiratory status of CF patients was observed.

There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. FINDINGS: A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at \u221280\u00B0C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. CONCLUSIONS: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV divergence.","publish_time":"2015-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Duengkae, Prateep; Rodpan, Apaporn; Kaewpom, Thongchai; Maneeorn, Patarapol; Kanchanasaka, Budsabong; Yingsakmongkon, Sangchai; Sittidetboripat, Nuntaporn; Chareesaen, Chaiyaporn; Khlangsap, Nathawat; Pidthong, Apisit; Leadprathom, Kumron; Ghai, Siriporn; Epstein, Jonathan H; Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J; Blair, Patrick J; Callahan, Michael V; Hemachudha, Thiravat","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4416284.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25884446/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0289-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hipposideros"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Thailand","Eastern Thailand"],"keyphrases":["CoV RNA","SARS-CoV","bat CoV lineages","different bat species","CoV divergence","new bat CoV reservoirs","Bats","endemic species","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV","characterization of additional CoV genes","different locations","Eastern Thailand","complex ecology of CoVs","zoonotic potential of CoVs","RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene","genetic lineage","RNA stabilization reagent","eastern regions of Thailand","rectal swabs","lineage D betacoronaviruses","lineage B betacoronavirus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","viral diversity","high diversity","phylogenetic data","Rhinolophus shameli","Hipposideros lekaguli","Taphozous melanopogon","standardized surveillance efforts","Scotophilus heathii","reactive consensus PCR primers","specific areas","Cynopterus sphinx","study","Megaderma lyra","diverse range of coronaviruses","human pathogens","wildlife","ice","fresh feces","alphacoronaviruses","total","provinces","date","Samples","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","specimens","analysis","hours","hosts"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID50virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99. The multiplex PCR developed in this study will be valuable for rapid identification, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological studies of these two serotypes of IBV infections.","publish_time":"1999-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, X.; Khan, M.

Although assays are designed to detect highly conserved genomic targets, mutations can influence test sensitivity. Most of the circulating viruses in the United States during the 2014\u20132015 season were associated with significant genetic drift; however, the effect on testing was unknown. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We compared the performance of Prodesse ProFlu\u002B/ProFAST\u002B (PFlu/PFAST), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP), cobas(\u00AE) Influenza A/B test (cIAB), and Xpert(\u00AE) Flu (Xpt) in a retrospective analysis of consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens received for a two-week period during the winter of 2015. Furthermore, limits of detection (LOD) were determined with six isolates of Flu. RESULTS: Of the 275 specimens, 63 were positive for FluA by PFAST, 60 were positive by RP, 58 were positive by cIAB and 52 were positive by Xpt. Only a subset of 135 specimens was tested by PFlu, of which 32 were positive. The sensitivity/specificity for PFAST, RP, cIAB, Xpt and PFlu was 100/99.1%, 96.7/99.5%, 91.8/99.1%, 85.2%/100%, and 75.6%/98.9%, respectively. LOD analyses demonstrated assay performance variations were strain associated. Specifically, PFlu\u2019s and cIAB\u2019s LODs were higher with A/Texas/50/2012-like and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strains, while Xpt\u2019s highest LOD was with the Swiss strain. CONCLUSIONS: Strain-associated assay performance variation is known to occur with other Flu test methods; hence, it is not surprising that such variation would be observed with molecular tests. Careful monitoring and reporting for strain-associated variances are warranted for all test methods.","publish_time":"2017-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stellrecht, Kathleen A.; Nattanmai, Seela M.; Butt, Jumshan; Maceira, Vincente P.; Espino, Alvin A.; Castro, Allan J.; Landes, Allen; Dresser, Nicolas; Butt, Shafiq A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8907b0e38da35bf1a9568f678679dfd476a2a9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173001.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217301567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600949/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217301567","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza A/B","LOD"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Flu test methods","PFAST","RP","Strain-associated assay performance variation","test sensitivity","strain-associated variances","Swiss strain","B test","isolates of Flu","assay performance variations","LOD analyses","influenza","testing","Xpt\u2019s highest LOD","performance of Prodesse ProFlu","retrospective analysis of consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens","Nucleic acid amplification assays","FilmArray Respiratory Panel","superior accuracy","mutations","reporting","method of choice","ProFAST","two-week period","conserved genomic targets","season","faster turnaround time","effect","BACKGROUND","strains","cobas","specificity","CONCLUSIONS","Xpert","significant genetic drift","FluA","cIAB\u2019s LODs","United States","Careful monitoring","circulating viruses","PFlu\u2019s","STUDY DESIGN","OBJECTIVES","Texas","winter","molecular tests","limits of detection","Switzerland","RESULTS","subset"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and safety of chloroquine that should be considered in light of use in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as \u2018loading doses\u2019 in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were \u003C 2.5 \u03BCmol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.

Importantly, TIGIT signaling is functionally linked to IL-10 expression, which has an effect on both virus control and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, whether TIGIT has a function in viral persistence or limiting tissue pathology is unclear. Here we report that TIGIT modulation effectively alters the phenotype and cytokine profile of T cells during influenza and chronic LCMV infection, but does not affect virus control in vivo. Instead, TIGIT has an important effect in limiting immune pathology in peripheral organs by inducing IL-10. Our data therefore identify a function of TIGIT in limiting immune pathology that is independent of viral clearance.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schorer, Michelle; Rakebrandt, Nikolas; Lambert, Katharina; Hunziker, Annika; Pallmer, Katharina; Oxenius, Annette; Kipar, Anja; Stertz, Silke; Joller, Nicole","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc1597af8d62d0c917db2647c6b908ad346d6142.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7062903.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15025-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of TIGIT","immune pathology","TIGIT modulation","TIGIT pathway","tissue pathology","virus control","chronic viral infection","T cell responses","T cell dysfunction","fundamental function","viral persistence","chronic LCMV infection","independent of viral clearance","cytokine profile of T cells","important effect","maintenance of tissue homeostasis","influenza","balance","phenotype","efficient effector functions","peripheral organs","Co-inhibitory pathways","expression","data"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare professionals should use personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures during resuscitation and may consider defibrillation before donning personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perkins, G.D.; Morley, P.T.; Nolan, J.P.; Soar, J.; Berg, K.; Olasveengen, T.; Wyckoff, M.; Greif, R.; Singletary, N.; Castren, M.; de Caen, A.; Wang, T.; Escalante, R.; Merchant, R.M.; Hazinski, M.; Kloeck, D.; Heriot, G.; Couper, K.; Neumar, R.","journal":"Resuscitation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6800b08f66c841bdabf70125e6980cfbb96e9fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194051.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300957220301738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371027/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957220301738?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chest compressions","personal protective equipment","procedures","potential","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","pandemic lay rescuers","benefits of early resuscitation","current COVID","public-access defibrillation","children","infants","addition","harm","Treatment recommendations","providers","Healthcare professionals","rescue breaths","Consensus","Science","aerosols"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from enterotoxemia suspected lambs were used for screening of C. perfringens cpa gene by LAMP. The specificity of the LAMP amplified products was tested by digesting with restriction enzyme XmnI for alpha toxin gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 samples screened 112 (93.3%) samples were positive by both LAMP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of cpa gene which indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. The enzyme produced single cut in 162 base pair amplified product of alpha toxin gene at 81 base pair resulting in a single band in gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: Both LAMP and PCR for detection of cpa gene indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. Standardization of LAMP reaction for amplification of epsilon and beta toxin genes will help to identify the C. perfringens toxin types from the clinical samples. The test could be a suitable alternative to the PCR in detection of toxin types without the help of sophisticated machinery like thermal cycler. Considering its simplicity in operation and high sensitivity, there is the potential use of this technique in clinical diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2016-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radhika, B.; Kumar, N.

However, data are limited as to whether ambient fine particles contribute to the transmission of influenza and if so, how the association is modified by weather conditions. Objectives We examined the relationship between ambient PM2.5 and influenza incidence at the national level in China and explored the associations at different temperatures. Methods Daily data on concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\u003C2.5\u03BCm (PM2.5) and influenza incidence counts were collected in 47 Chinese cities. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the city-specific PM2.5-influenza association, after controlling for potential confounders. Then, a random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool the effects at national level. In addition, stratified analyses were performed to examine modification effects of ambient temperature. Results For single lag models, the highest effect of ambient PM2.5 on influenza incidence appeared at lag day 2, with relative risk (RR) of 1.015 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004, 1.025) associated with a 10\u03BCg/m3 increase in PM2.5. For moving average lag models, the significant association was found at lag 2\u20133days, with RR of 1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). The RR of influenza transmission associated with PM2.5 was higher for cold compared with hot days. Overall, 10.7% of incident influenza cases may result from exposure to ambient PM2.5. Conclusions Ambient PM2.5 may increase the risk of exposure to influenza in China especially on cooler days. Control measures to reduce PM2.5 concentrations could potentially also be of benefit in lowering the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission of influenza in China.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Gongbo; Zhang, Wenyi; Li, Shanshan; Zhang, Yongming; Williams, Gail; Huxley, Rachel; Ren, Hongyan; Cao, Wei; Guo, Yuming","journal":"Environment International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6a192287ab14152f32dfa5c2a25537bcc71fe1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112570.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27745688/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412016305530; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412016305530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["influenza association","Conclusions Ambient PM2","RR of influenza transmission","highest effect of ambient PM2","influenza incidence counts","subsequent transmission of influenza","incident influenza cases","city-specific PM2","risk of exposure","China","ambient fine particles","risk factor","relative risk","lag day","modification effects of ambient temperature","single lag models","average lag models","significant association","national level","hot days","cooler days","concentrations of particulate matter","Methods Daily data","random-effect meta-analysis","air pollution","aerodynamic diameter","good evidence","vascular health outcomes","associations","\u03BCm","Abstract Background","stratified analyses","Results","benefit","relationship","different temperatures","Chinese cities","potential confounders","Control measures","Poisson regression model","addition","confidence interval","weather conditions","Objectives","\u03BCg","m3"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In the present study, the immune responses of BALB/c mice immunized via intranasal (i.n.) route with SARS DNA vaccine (pci-S) in a PEI/pci-S complex form have been examined. The size of the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles appeared to be around 194.7 \u00B1 99.3 nm, and the expression of the S mRNA and protein was confirmed in vitro. The mice immunized with i.n. PEI/pci-S nanoparticles produced significantly (P \u003C 0.05) higher S-specific IgG1 in the sera and mucosal secretory IgA in the lung wash than those in mice treated with pci-S alone. Compared to those in mice challenged with pci-S alone, the number of B220(\u002B )cells found in PEI/pci-S vaccinated mice was elevated.

This review highlights the deleterious action of ACE/Ang-II/AT1R axis and the beneficial role of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/MasR axis, as well as AT2R, in VILI and ARDS, and also discusses the possibility of targeting RAS components with pharmacological interventions to improve outcomes in ARDS.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Di; Chai, Xiao-qing; Magnussen, Costan G.; Zosky, Graeme R.; Shu, Shu-hua; Wei, Xin; Hu, Shan-shan","journal":"Pulmonary Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9969c4a278d78d1205c81461f4f3063fc0c7acc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110665.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553919301051; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2019.101833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376462/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553919301051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ACE/Ang-II","VILI","RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of ARDS","AT1R axis","MasR axis","VILI","beneficial role of ACE2","beneficial pharmacological therapies","pharmacological interventions","respiratory failure","dual role","mechanical lung ventilation","induced lung injury","deleterious action of ACE","acute respiratory distress syndrome","possibility of targeting RAS components","adequate gas exchange","ill patients","effective treatments","phenomenon of ventilator","increasing need","renin-angiotensin system","outcomes","AT2R","review","Recent studies","result"],"language":"en"},

Neurologic disorders included cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome, epilepsy, non-Down syndrome chromosomal abnormalities, and spinal cord abnormalities. We compared the epidemiology, etiology, and clinical outcomes of CAP in children with neurologic disorders with those with non-neurologic underlying conditions, and those with no underlying conditions using bivariate, age-stratified, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results From January 2010-June 2012, 2358 children with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled; 280 (11.9%) had a neurologic disorder (52.1% of these individuals also had non-neurologic underlying conditions), 934 (39.6%) had non-neurologic underlying conditions only, and 1144 (48.5%) had no underlying conditions. Children with neurologic disorders were older and more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission than children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and children with no underlying conditions; similar proportions were mechanically ventilated. In age-stratified analysis, children with neurologic disorders were less likely to have a pathogen detected than children with non-neurologic underlying conditions. In multivariate analysis, having a neurologic disorder was associated with ICU admission for children \u22652 years of age.

Many BEVS products include proteins and protein complexes that require expression from more than one gene. This review examines the expression strategies that have been used to this end and focuses on the distinguishing features between those that make use of single polycistronic baculovirus (co-expression) and those that use multiple monocistronic baculoviruses (co-infection). Three major areas in which researchers have been able to take advantage of co-expression/co-infection are addressed, including compound structure-function studies, insect cell functionality augmentation, and VLP production. The core of the review discusses the parameters of interest for co-infection and co-expression with time of infection (TOI) and multiplicity of infection (MOI) highlighted for the former and the choice of promoter for the latter.

In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an agent that has caused devastating losses in the international swine industry since the late 1980s. Using protein quantification and microscopy, we observed that PRRSV infection results in LC3-I/II conversion, an increased accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3-expressing cells, and a higher number of autophagosome-like double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells. Inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or small interfering RNAs targeting ATG7 and Beclin-1 led to a significant reduction in PRRSV titers and protein expression. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin resulted in increased viral replication. These results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces autophagy which, in turn, enhances viral replication efficiency.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Quangang; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Wang, Shaohua; Li, Ping; Li, Mao; Luo, Rui; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/256e782f7d1e9db7f899c577130575a3916ce474.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114478.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.11.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211004576; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211004576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased viral replication","Abstract Autophagy","role of autophagy","Inhibition of autophagy","induction of autophagy","viral replication efficiency","PRRSV infection results","PRRSV titers","replication of porcine reproductive","protein expression","protein quantification","increased accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3","cytoplasm of host cells","important functions","respiratory syndrome virus","double-membrane vesicles","conserved lysosome-dependent degradation pathway","international swine industry","small interfering RNAs","devastating losses","Beclin","significant reduction","rapamycin","turn","maintenance of cellular homeostasis","higher number of autophagosome","ATG7","agent","conversion","pathogenesis","microscopy","methyladenine","study"],"language":"en"},

Viral and host-related risk factors for severe disease have also not been clearly established. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether certain viral features of RSV and, or HRV are associated with severe ALRTI. STUDY DESIGN: RSV and HRV were studied in nasopharyngeal samples of infants by immunofluorescence, Luminex(\u00AE) and/or real-time RT-PCR assays. Quantitation and genotyping of RSV and HRV by PCR were done. RESULTS: Of 124 virus positive specimens, 74 (59.7%) had RSV; 22 (17.7%) HRV and 28 (22.6%) RSV-HRV co-infection. Hospitalization was required in 57/74 RSV infants (77.0%); in 10/22 HRV cases (45.5%) (p = 0.006) and in 15/28 co-infected by both viruses (53.6%) (p = 0.003). Severe cases were 33/74 (44.6%) RSV infections, 2/22 HRV cases (9.1%), (p \u003C 0.002) and 6/28 (21.4%) patients co-infected by RSV\u2013HRV (p \u003C 0.026). Three genotypes (NA1, B7, B9) of RSV circulated during the study. In 33 severe infants, NA1 was detected in 19 cases (57.6%); B7 in 13 (39.4%) and B9 in 1 (3.0%) (p \u003C 0.01; OR = 10.0). RSV loads were similar between outpatients and hospitalized infants (p = 0.7) and among different severities (p = 0.7). NA1 loads were higher than other strains (p = 0.049). Three geno-groups of HRV circulated homogeneously. CONCLUSION: In very young infants, RSV cause more severe disease than HRV. Co-infection does not increase the severity of illness. NA1 RSV genotype was associated with major frequency of hospitalization, severe respiratory disease and higher viral load.","publish_time":"2014-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luchsinger, Vivian; Ampuero, Sandra; Palomino, M.

However, the molecular basis for this biotype switch is unknown. We examined a furin cleavage site in the region between receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains of the spike of serotype 1 FCoV. FECV sequences were compared with FIPV sequences. All FECVs had a conserved furin cleavage motif. For FIPV, there was a correlation with the disease and \u003E1 substitution in the S1/S2 motif. Fluorogenic peptide assays confirmed that the substitutions modulate furin cleavage. We document a functionally relevant S1/S2 mutation that arises when FIP develops in a cat.

Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.","publish_time":"1989-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFarland, Henry F.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl","journal":"Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4851683684a154b0c8d985afb77165d01f8f49df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0090122989901165; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0090122989901165","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["devastating disease","principal demyelinating disease","mediated disease processes","infectious process","polygenic effect","genetic factors","single gene","strongest evidence","gene locus","immunological process","genetic makeup influences susceptibility","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","central nervous system","high risk areas","cases","people","environmental influence","major elements","important findings","etiology of","role","young adults","unpredictable course","research","present","discouraging","cause","prevalence","effective treatment","review","MS"],"language":"en"},

Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raha, Syamal; Mallick, Rahul; Basak, Sanjay; Duttaroy, Asim K.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3ac38168311484a0f86af3f72ea122618238329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199671.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720308136; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388476/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720308136?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood cells","B cells","functions of critical immune cells","T helper cells","Cu-deficient humans","infectious viruses","RNA viruses","pathogens","COVID","SARS","killing of infectious microbes","bronchitis virus","adaptive immunity","critical option","Abstract Copper","available data","cell-mediated immunity","immune system competent","potent capacity of contact","potent antiviral activities","human immunodeficiency virus type","enrichment of plasma copper levels","poliovirus","neutrophils natural killer","NK","double-stranded DNA","infections","HIV","exceptional susceptibility","production of specific antibodies","decreased number","hosts","essential micronutrient","therapeutic regime","viral infection","people","drugs","current outbreak","vaccine","macrophages"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a quantitative TaqMan PCR for detection and quantitation of canine and feline parvoviruses in serum and fecal samples was developed.

A standard curve was generated, and validation tests were performed using 10-fold serial dilutions of CPV-2 virus in CPV/FPLV-negative feces and CPV/FPLV-negative serum samples. As a result, the 100% detection limit of the PCR was 18 copies of the viral genome per \u03BCl of serum and fecal sample. All canine parvovirus types as well as FPLV were detected.

Abstract Lymphocytopenia is defined by a lymphocyte count less than 1500/mm3 in adults and less than 4500/mm3 in children before the age of 8 months. Lymphocytopenia can be global or selectively affect a peculiar lymphocyte subpopulation. The patient\u0027s age, the context as well as the associated clinical manifestations and treatment prescribed must be taken into account in order to identify the etiology of lymphocytopenia. In adults, lymphocytopenia can be caused by: (1) insufficient thymic output (primary immune deficiencies, corticosteroid treatment, zinc deficiency, etc.), (2) increased lymphocyte catabolism (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant, HIV infection, systemic lupus, etc.), (3) modified lymphocyte distribution (viral infections, septic shock, extensive burns, splenomegaly, granulomatosis, etc.), (4) multifactorial or unknown etiology (end-stage renal disease, lymphoid malignancies, solid tumor, ethnicity, etc.). In children, in addition to these etiologies, other immune deficiencies may be responsible for severe lymphocytopenia (thymocytes apoptosis, cytokine deficiencies, altered B-cell and T-cell receptor synthesis, signal transduction and cellular interactions deficiencies). Idiopathic CD4\u002B lymphocytopenia is a rare disorder. It is defined by a persisting lymphocyte CD4\u002B count less or equal to 300/mm3 or less or equal to 20% of total lymphocytes in the absence of alternative diagnosis. Clinical symptoms can be absent or include opportunistic infections, auto-immune manifestations, lymphoma or solid tumors. Treatment is similar to that of HIV-infected patients and sometimes relies on specific immunotherapy even though clinical benefit has not been evaluated.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00E9gent, A.; Kluger, N.; B\u00E9rezn\u00E9, A.; Lassoued, K.; Mouthon, L.","journal":"La Revue de M\u00E9decine Interne","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3eaa251331677ae3d74bd310f4bade125209ea58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115373.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0248866312004894; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0248866312004894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mm3 or less or equal to","mm3 in adults","total lymphocytes in the absence","mm3 in children before the age","lymphop\u00E9nie CD4","Lymphocytopenia can be global","lymphocytopenia can be caused","severe lymphocytopenia","persisting lymphocyte CD4","Abstract Lymphocytopenia is defined","immune manifestations","in addition to these etiologies","The patient\u0027s age","less than","r\u00E9cepteurs des lymphocytes","lymphocytes totaux","adulte","Treatment is similar to that","the context as well as the associated clinical manifestations","treatment prescribed must be taken into account in order to identify the etiology","primary immune deficiencies","Clinical symptoms can be absent","other immune deficiencies may be responsible","cytokine deficiencies","infections virales","viral infections","d\u00E9faut de la transduction","Idiopathic CD4","cellular interactions deficiencies","peculiar lymphocyte subpopulation","modified lymphocyte distribution","increased lymphocyte catabolism","lymphocytes circulants inf\u00E9rieur","It is defined","corticosteroid treatment","include opportunistic infections","HIV infection","d\u00E9faut de synth\u00E8se","signal transduction","d\u00E9ficits immunitaires primitifs","VIH","absence de diagnostic alternatif","diagnostic \u00E9tiologique","enfant","manifestations clinicobiologiques associ\u00E9es","d\u00E9faut des pr\u00E9curseurs thymiques","infected patients","unknown etiology","zinc deficiency","sympt\u00F4mes auto","insuffisance de production","solid tumors","systemic lupus","interactions cellulaires","rare disorder","\u00E9tiologies multifactorielles","lupus syst\u00E9mique","affection rare","specific immunotherapy even though clinical benefit","cell receptor synthesis","insuffisance r\u00E9nale chronique","charge des patients infect\u00E9s","selectively affect","h\u00E9mopathies lympho\u00EFdes","lymphoid malignancies","end-stage renal disease","septic shock","thymocytes apoptosis","sometimes","immunosuppressant","choc septique","chemotherapy","expression s\u00E9v\u00E8re","br\u00FBlures \u00E9tendues","extensive burns","d\u00E9ficit cytokinique","chimioth\u00E9rapie","radiotherapy","corticoth\u00E9rapie","insufficient thymic output","tumeur solide","traitements immunosuppresseurs","alternative diagnosis","radioth\u00E9rapie","hyperspl\u00E9nisme","splenomegaly","prise","altered","carence","lymphoma","causes ethniques","particulier cytop\u00E9nies","immunoth\u00E9rapie sp\u00E9cifique","ethnicity","contexte","months","exc\u00E8s de catabolisme","population lymphocytaire particuli\u00E8re","b\u00E9n\u00E9fice clinique","granulomatoses","granulomatosis","recours","multifactorial","\u00E2ge","evaluated","modification de la r\u00E9partition","germes opportunistes","n\u00E9oplasies","lymphop\u00E9nies","\u00E9limination","mois"],"language":"fr"},

Because of the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for supporting HBV infection efficiently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection remain incompletely understood. Duck heptatitis B virus (DHBV) can naturally infect primary duck hepatocytes (PDHs) that provide valuable model systems for studying hepadnavirus infection in vitro. In this report, we explored global changes in cellular protein expression in DHBV infected PDHs by two-dimension gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: The effects of hepadnavirus infection on hepatocytes were investigated in DHBV infected PDHs by the 2-DE analysis. Proteomic profile of PDHs infected with DHBV were analyzed at 24, 72 and 120 h post-infection by comparing with uninfected PDHs, and 75 differentially expressed protein spots were revealed by 2-DE analysis. Among the selected protein spots, 51 spots were identified corresponding to 42 proteins by MS/MS analysis; most of them were matched to orthologous proteins of Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos or other avian species, including alpha-enolase, lamin A, aconitase 2, cofilin-2 and annexin A2, etc. The down-regulated expression of beta-actin and annexin A2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and potential roles of some differentially expressed proteins in the virus-infected cells have been discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed proteins of DHBV infected PDHs revealed by 2-DE, are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress responses and cytoskeleton processes etc, providing the insight to understanding of interactions between hepadnavirus and hepatocytes and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yanfeng; Ben, Haijing; Qu, Su; Zhou, Xinwen; Yan, Liang; Xu, Bin; Zhou, Shuangcheng; Lou, Qiang; Ye, Rong; Zhou, Tianlun; Yang, Pengyuan; Qu, Di","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6af49373c566eac05d2609e3474e847157cafb3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2904733.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-8-28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anas","Differentially"],"organizations":["HBV","DHBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins of DHBV infected PDHs","HBV infection","effects of hepadnavirus infection","MS analysis","molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection","uninfected PDHs","virus-infected cells","h post-infection","Proteomic profile of PDHs","molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus pathogenesis","cellular protein expression","selected protein spots","orthologous proteins of Gallus gallus","major cause of liver infection","primary duck hepatocytes","annexin A2","Hepatitis B virus","Duck heptatitis B virus","Western blot analysis","carbohydrate metabolism","MALDI-TOF","amino acid metabolism","regulated expression of beta","TOF tandem mass spectrometry","stress responses","Anas platyrhynchos","appropriate cell culture system","avian species","cytoskeleton processes","global changes","valuable model systems","actin","potential roles","alpha-enolase","lamin","lack","cofilin","insight","human","BACKGROUND","dimension gel electrophoresis","interactions","aconitase","RESULTS","report","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the suckler calf is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment. The efficacy and economical viability of vaccination against respiratory disease in calves remains unclear.","publish_time":"2011-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorenz, Ingrid; Earley, Bernadette; Gilmore, John; Hogan, Ian; Kennedy, Emer; More, Simon J","journal":"Ir Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8abf33baca8c7abbbf6ca5f56b404b79f658dd26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3220626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018053/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-0481-64-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of pneumonia","weaned suckler calves","time of weaning","Early signs of pneumonia","respiratory disease","successful group housing of calves","suckler calf","decreased risk of disease","early onset of treatment","disease prevention","relevant risk factors","key risk factors","pre-weaned calf","calf health","review series","subsequent adequate duration of treatment","economical viability of vaccination","greater management challenges","environmental change","subsequent morbidity","vaccination programmes","multiple stressors","additional stressors","groups stable","increased respiratory rate","equal age groups","economic viability of cattle operations","transport","painful husbandry procedures","nutrition","success of therapy","major impact","effective approaches","castration","aetiology","fever","preconditioning","sound","particular reference","important factor","dehorning","cumulative effects","Calfhood diseases","mortality","feedlot","diagnosis","efficacy","shelter","Special emphasis","reduction","depression","birth","studies","paper"],"language":"en"},

The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 \u00C5 resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in \u201Cdown\u201D positions. The binding of the \u201Cdown\u201D CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 \u00C5 resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the \u201Cdown\u201D position by different angles to an \u201Cup\u201D position. The \u201Cup\u201D CTD1 exposes the receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gui, Miao; Song, Wenfei; Zhou, Haixia; Xu, Jingwei; Chen, Silian; Xiang, Ye; Wang, Xinquan","journal":"Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ebc09cec2a54ebc2629bf09e02a6c19493fc750.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5223232.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2016.152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28008928/; https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016152.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor binding","binding of SARS","SARS-CoV receptor ACE2","receptor-binding site","infection of SARS","SARS-CoV surface spike trimer","new human coronavirus SARS-CoV","receptor-binding C-terminal domain","global outbreak of SARS","S1 subunits","different conformational states","CTD1s","Conformations","intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer","form trimer spikes","new insights","ACE2 engagement","S2 subunits","different angles","conformational change","\u00C5 resolutions","inactive state","viral surface glycoproteins","single-particle cryo-electron microscopy","envelope","betacoronaviruses","antibodies","steric clashes","ectodomain structures","virions","positions","RBD","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

We described the characteristics of Epi-Aids conducted during 2005\u20132014 and summarized the publication outcome of Epi-Aid related scientific information products. METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of all Epi-Aids conducted during January 1, 2005\u2013December 31, 2014; investigations were categorized by health topic and geographic distribution. We highlighted investigations of substantial public health importance, e.g., multistate investigations and investigations of epidemics and pandemics. We identified the Epi-Aid publication outcome by searching PubMed for Epi-Aid related publications, which included Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWRs) and peer-reviewed publications with an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer (EISO) as a coauthor. We calculated publication timeliness and categorized publications by journal impact factor. RESULTS: During the study period, 698 EISOs and their collaborators participated in 807 Epi-Aids throughout the United States and globally. Approximately 81 Epi-Aids were conducted annually (range, 62\u2013104); 632 (78.3%) were infectious disease-related; 161 (20.0%) were international, supporting 68 countries. As of June 2015, EISOs, in collaboration with partners, published 131 MMWRs and 280 scientific manuscripts on the basis of the 807 Epi-Aids conducted during the study period; 394 (48.8%) Epi-Aids resulted in publications in 80 peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: EISOs play a critical role in conducting Epi-Aids, which require qualified field epidemiologists who can rapidly respond to requests for assistance during public health emergencies. Publications based on Epi-Aids share new knowledge with the scientific community, furthering progress of public health science and practice.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coronado, F\u00E1tima; Chen, Guan M.; Bosch, Stacey A.; Eaton, Danice K.","journal":"J Epidemiol Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e612cdb92d11fa37a9c7f74d629062bc66b9fdfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178019.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.19104/jepm.2016.116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Epi-Aids","characteristics of Epi","Epi-Aid related publications","publication outcome of Epi","Epi-Aid publication outcome","categorized publications","public health organizations","public health emergencies","investigations of substantial public health importance","peer-reviewed publications","health topic","multistate investigations","investigations of epidemics","EISOs","epidemiologic assistance investigations","furthering progress of public health science","MMWRs","scientific community","scientific manuscripts","publication timeliness","infectious disease-related","study period","scientific information products","peer-reviewed journals","Disease Control","Morbidity","PubMed","Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer","important mechanism","Prevention","new knowledge","Centers","Mortality Weekly Reports","journal impact factor","requests","critical role","practice","descriptive analysis","basis","collaborators","qualified field epidemiologists","CONCLUSIONS","geographic distribution","collaboration","partners","pandemics","United States","METHODS","coauthor","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","countries","range"],"language":"en"},

In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-\u0394ORF3-RFP. icPEDV-\u0394ORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-\u0394ORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A.

In addition to specific antiviral agents, massive vaccination is thought to be the most effective way of controlling the transmission. To understand the prevaccination status of certain risk groups, this study compared the baseline sero-prevalence of antibodies to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus among hospital staff with different contact risks and that of the general population. Methods A total of 295 serum samples from hospital staff and 244 control serum samples from people who came for physical check-up (control group) were collected between October 2009 and November 2009 before the massive vaccination campaign. The hospital staff was divided into first-line risk personnel (group 1) and second-line risk personnel (group 2) according to their potential contact risks. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were conducted to determine the individual serological status. The seropositive rate (SPR, defined as the proportion with HI titer \u2265 1:40) of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus and its geometric mean titer (GMT) were calculated and compared among the different groups. Results The mean ages and sex ratio (% male) of the hospital staff and control groups were 36.9 \u00B1 10.6 years and 52.0 \u00B1 12.6 years, and 24.4% and 57.6%, respectively. The SPR of the antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was significantly higher than that of the control group (20.0% vs. 2.9%, p \u003C 0.001). Furthermore, the SPR antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of group 1 were significantly higher than that of group 2 (30.8% vs. 12.6%, p \u003C 0.001). However, the GMT of antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus of the hospital staff was not significantly different from that of the control group (p = 0.925). Conclusion The SPR of antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the hospital staff was higher than that in the general population, reflecting a higher contact risk. Prevaccination surveillance of the immune status of different risk groups may help to prioritize which groups should be vaccinated first.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Yu-Jiun; Lee, Chia-Ling; Hwang, Shinn-Jang; Fung, Chang-Phone; Wang, Fu-Der; Yen, David H.T.; Tsai, Cheng-Hsien; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Lee, Shou-Dong","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcc3b8063446069a3d8e2fb5288f4178d6ce74b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490110700034; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1726-4901(10)70003-4; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490110700034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20171584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital staff","H1N1 influenza virus of group","SPR antibodies","SPR of antibodies","control groups","different groups","GMT of antibodies","higher contact risk","immune status of different risk groups","prevaccination status of certain risk groups","control serum samples","different contact risks","line risk personnel","pandemic","potential contact risks","general population","HI titer","years","geometric mean titer","individual serological status","massive vaccination campaign","mean ages","Prevaccination surveillance","study","specific antiviral agents","people","male","baseline sero-prevalence","physical check-up","tests","addition","sex ratio","total","Hemagglutination-inhibition","Methods","proportion","effective way","transmission","seropositive rate","Conclusion","world"],"language":"en"},

First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chick\u2019s infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV \u002B IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection. In conclusion, co-infection of chicks with AIV and IBV, simultaneously or sequentially, affected the clinical signs, the virus replication dynamics as well as the internal organ integrity. The results proposed that infection with heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rim, Aouini; Nacira, Laamiri; Jihene, Nsiri; Said, Salhi; Khaled, Miled; Ahmed, Rejab; Abdeljelil, Ghram","journal":"Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45aeabc5383c393a7d31d1a94973aaf59eb3d47b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112602.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2019.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300117/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957119301109; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957119301109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIV","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AIV IBV","AIV H9N2 infection","IBV co-infection","mixed AIV","IBV genomes","Quantitative results of AIV","inoculated virus","heterologous virus","virus replication dynamics","infectious bronchitis virus","co-infection of chicks","replication interference of avian influenza virus","days","low pathogenic avian influenza virus","case of super-infection","inoculated chicks","avian infectious bronchitis","qRT-PCR","decreased viral growth","vaccine strain","histopathological analyses of internal organs","vaccine application","ELISA test","quantitative reverse transcription","viral copy numbers","ELISA antibody levels","internal organ integrity","H9N2 Tunisian isolate","polymerase chain reaction","competent cells","temporary competition","cell receptors","sera of chick\u2019s infected","H120","interferences","dual infections","specific antibodies","viruses","interaction","clinical signs","likely interferon","histopathology examination","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Recently, based on our model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) model, we suggested specific molecular mechanisms used by different viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to modulate the host immune response mediated by members of the family of multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). This family includes T cell receptor (TCR) that is critically involved in immune diseases such as autoimmune arthritis. In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis. Using the SCHOOL approach and the SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence, we rationally designed a novel immunomodulatory peptide that targets TCR. We showed that this peptide ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice and protects against bone and cartilage damage. Incorporation of the peptide into self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human high density lipoproteins significantly increases peptide dosage efficacy. Together, our data further confirm that viral immune evasion strategies that target MIRRs can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities.","publish_time":"2016-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Zu T.; Sigalov, Alexander B.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf001dd7a7e2e974fa974607ccbcd9a2de960d2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4923882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep28672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model of immune","immune diseases","host immune response","viral immune evasion strategies","host antiviral immune responses","peptide dosage efficacy","novel immunomodulatory peptide","SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence","family of multichain immune recognition receptors","different viruses","MIRRs","therapeutic strategies","numerous strategies","TCR","co-evolution of viruses","autoimmune arthritis","SCHOOL approach","collagen-induced arthritis","native human high density lipoproteins","self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","order","members","specific molecular mechanisms","J mice","DBA","hosts","bone","evidence","support","T cell receptor","Chain HOmoOLigomerization","present study","similar functionalities","Incorporation","data","cartilage damage","successful infection","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan, China in December, 2019, can cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. We present the relevant autopsy findings of the first patient known to have died from COVID19 pneumonia in Spain, carried out on the 14th of February, 2020, in our hospital (Hospital Arnau de Vilanova-Lliria, Valencia). Histological examination revealed changes typical of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in both the exudative and proliferative phase of acute lung injury.

If these attitudes can be associated with various factors among the general public (e.g. social norms, lack of knowledge), it is also important to understand the attitude of scientists who study bats. Such reflexive information on the researchers community itself could indeed help designing adequate mixed communication tools aimed at protecting bats and their ecosystems, as well as humans living in their vicinity that could be exposed to their pathogens. Thus, we conducted an online survey targeting researchers who spend a part of their research activity studying bats. Our aim was to determine (1) how they perceive their object of study, (2) how they perceive the representation of bats in the media and by the general population, (3) how they protect themselves against pathogen infections during their research practices, and (4) their perceptions of the causes underlying the decline in bat populations worldwide. From the 587 completed responses (response rate of 28%) having a worldwide distribution, the heterogeneity of the scientists\u2019 perception of their own object of study was highlighted. In the majority of cases, this depended on the type of research they conducted (i.e. laboratory versus field studies) as well as their research speciality. Our study revealed a high level of personal protection equipment being utilised against pathogens during scientific practices, although the role bats play as reservoirs for a number of emerging pathogens remains poorly known. Our results also disclosed the unanimity among specialists in attributing a direct role for humans in the global decline of bat populations, mainly via environmental change, deforestation, and agriculture intensification. Overall, the present study suggests the need for better communication regarding bats and their biology, their role within the scientific community, as well as in the general public population. As a consequence, increased knowledge regarding scientists\u2019 perceptions of bats should improve the role scientists play in influencing the perception of bats by the general public.","publish_time":"2016-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bo\u00EBte, Christophe; Morand, Serge","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/352fc70d79c0668a5a7583538fe0167c1fd785d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5104368.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832185/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165969","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role bats","perception of bats","representation of bats","scientists\u2019 perceptions of bats","object of study","role scientists","humans","general public population","research practices","general population","present study","direct role","type of research","research activity","research speciality","scientific community","conflicting perceptions","scientific practices","researchers community","global decline of bat populations","number of emerging pathogens","better communication","increased knowledge","lack of knowledge","attitude of scientists","worldwide distribution","adequate mixed communication tools","help","environmental change","high level of personal protection equipment","social norms","need","reservoirs","biology","deforestation","specialists","heterogeneity","various factors","consequence","causes","media","agriculture intensification","completed responses","response rate","unanimity","laboratory","reflexive information","pathogen infections","field studies","results","attitudes","online survey","affection","ecosystems","majority of cases","vicinity","aim"],"language":"en"},

Summary The burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is global and major. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile are the most frequent associated pathogens. Infection control measures are crucial but not sufficient to stem the burden of HAIs. Due to antimicrobial resistance, lack of therapeutic options for treatment of totally-drug resistant organism is also observed. Therefore, alternative strategies to antimicrobial drugs are urgently needed to prevent and treat HAI. Among these strategies, vaccines and passive immunization are probably one of the most attractive. In this review, we will discuss licensed and non-licensed vaccines for HAIs at-risk patients and HCWs to prevent HAI. The benefit of Influenza and rotavirus vaccines in patients to prevent these viral IAS is reviewed. The development of an S. aureus vaccine, previously associated to failures, seem to be complicated. These failures allow however a better knowledge of S. aureus immunity. For C. difficile, the goal of obtaining a preventive vaccine seems to be near. Development of vaccines to prevent gram negative bacteria involved in IAS remain challenging and confined in early phases of development. Vaccination of at risk patients is however challenging due to the poor immune response to vaccines usually obtained. Therefore, immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial to prevent IAS as it is associated to herd immunity. We also review here the benefit of HCWs immunization against measles, pertussis, influenza, varicella and hepatitis B to prevent HAIs.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagneux-Brunon, A.; Lucht, F.; Launay, O.; Berthelot, P.; Botelho-Nevers, E.","journal":"Journal des Anti-infectieux","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d47571c5fb1cc24518b398efffd9e17c19aa3026.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210654517300285; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210654517300285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["L\u2019antibior\u00E9sistance"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["IAS virales","HCWs to prevent HAI","is crucial to prevent IAS as it is associated to herd immunity","to antimicrobial resistance","The development","vaccination des patients","urgently needed to prevent","rotavirus vaccines in patients to prevent these viral IAS is reviewed","sufficient to stem the burden","previously associated to failures","to the poor immune response to vaccines usually obtained","the goal","seem to be complicated","vaccines to prevent gram negative bacteria involved in IAS remain challenging","vaccination des soignants","alternative strategies to antimicrobial drugs","the most attractive","Summary The burden","aureus vaccine","Staphylococcus aureus","aureus immunity","preventive vaccine seems to be near","licensed vaccines","is global","the most frequent associated pathogens","at risk patients is however challenging","associated infections","We also review here the benefit","Clostridium difficile","int\u00E9r\u00EAt de la vaccination grippale","passive immunization","In this review","HCWs immunization against measles","drug resistant organism is also observed","Influenza","These failures allow however","Among these strategies","Escherichia coli","Therefore","vaccins disponibles","d\u00E9veloppement clinique","mise","point","\u00E9checs","confined in early phases","crucial but","we will discuss licensed","healthcare workers","treat HAI","infections associ\u00E9es","immunisation passive","vaccin pr\u00E9ventif","bact\u00E9ries gram n\u00E9gatif responsables","totally","obtaining","treatment","therapeutic options","pertussis","better knowledge","lack","varicella","probably","Infection control measures","soins","hepatitis","prise","impasses th\u00E9rapeutiques","hygi\u00E8ne hospitali\u00E8re","grippe","coqueluche","rougeole","v\u00E9ritable probl\u00E8me de sant\u00E9 publique","risques","antibioth\u00E9rapie","charge","mesures","varicelle","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","disposition","probl\u00E8mes de r\u00E9ponse vaccinale","h\u00E9patite","strat\u00E9gies alternatives","connaissances","effet de groupe","immunit\u00E9","major","antibior\u00E9sistance","origine"],"language":"fr"},

Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Longxian; Li, Gaolei; Chen, Jinhui; Liang, Xinle; Li, Yudong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36de3ee78cde435f98b7ad3d04652748895254e9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6d0127f985edbe088bc279865bef25a31f54a066.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.969006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV RaTG13","sequenced SARS-CoV","different SARS-CoV","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","evolution of SARS","comparison of SARS","evolution mechanism of SARS","related coronavirus strains","nucleotide mutations","ratio of nucleotide substitutions","amino acid substitutions of spike gene","Bat-SARSr","elevated synonymous mutations","WIV04","positive selection","comparisons","single-stranded RNA genome","ratios of non-synonymous","synonymous substitution rates","amino acid change","sites of spike protein","result of neutral evolution","beta-coronavirus lineage B","positive-polarity","mutation signature","deactivity of RNA","mutation pattern","stronger purifying selection","dN","comprehensive genomic analysis","viral pathogenicity","dS","small impact","evolutionary mechanisms","family coronaviridae","C transition","codon usage","stringent selective pressure","member","adaptation","hosts","results","coronaviruses","range","nCoV","exoribonuclease","ExoN"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, we investigated its association with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the impact of PTSD diagnosis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in HCV infected subjects. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 127 HCV-infected outpatients recruited at a University Hospital in Salvador, Brazil. All subjects answered an orally-administered questionnaire to gather clinical and socio-demographic data. We investigated traumatic experiences and the subject\u0027s perception of the disease using the Trauma History Questionnaire. PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses were assessed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Brazilian Version 5.0.0 (M.I.N.I. PLUS). HRQoL was assessed using Short-Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: Approximately 38.6% of the patients considered hepatitis C to be a traumatic experience. Of these, 60.7% had a PTSD diagnosis. PTSD was associated with significant impairment in quality of life for individuals in seven SF-36 domains as shown bymultivariate analysis: Role-Physical (\u03B2: \u221224.85; 95% CI: \u221242.08; \u22127.61), Bodily Pain (\u03B2: \u221219.36; 95% CI: \u221231.28; \u22127.45), General Health (\u03B2: \u221220.79; 95% CI: \u221229.65; \u221211.92), Vitality (\u03B2: \u221211.92; 95% CI: \u221220.74; \u22123.1), Social Functioning (\u03B2: \u221234.73; 95% CI: \u221246.79; \u221222.68), Role-Emotional (\u03B2: \u221226.07; 95% CI: \u221244.61; \u22127.53), Mental Health (\u03B2: \u221217.46; 95% CI: \u221224.38; \u221210.54).

We hypothesized that such an excessive response to respiratory tract viral infection is caused by host factors reflected in pre-existing increased bronchial responsiveness. Objective We sought to compare bronchial responsiveness and lung function in 1-month-old neonates who later develop acute severe bronchiolitis with those who do not. Methods We measured infant lung function (n = 402) and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (n = 363) using the raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique before any respiratory symptoms in 1-month-old neonates from the Copenhagen Prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood birth cohort born to mothers with asthma. The children were prospectively monitored for respiratory symptoms and given a diagnosis of acute severe bronchiolitis according to a fixed algorithm. Results Thirty-four (8.5%) infants had acute severe bronchiolitis before 2 years of age, 21 (62%) were hospitalized, and 23 (67%) of the cases were associated with respiratory syncytial virus. Children who later had acute severe bronchiolitis irrespective of viral species had a 2.5-fold increased responsiveness to methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure [PD15]) at age 1 month compared with control subjects (median PD15 in cases vs control subjects, 0.13 vs 0.33 \u03BCmol; P = .01), whereas differences in baseline airflow were not significant for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, \u22120.18 vs \u22120.01; P = .36) and forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, \u22120.37 vs \u22120.09; P = .13).

In in vitro cultures canine coronaviruses generally induce extensive cell death, however nature of the events leading to cell death remains largely unknown. We analysed the induction of cytopathic effect by CCoV in a canine fibrosarcoma cell line (A-72) in order to characterize the apoptotic effect in homologous cell system. Following CCoV infection A-72 cell line, which is permissive to CCoV, showed reduced growth rate, as detected by MTT assay, a standard colorimetric assay for measuring cellular proliferation, and underwent to apoptotic death. Starting from 24h after CCoV infection, cells morphology appeared dramatically changed, with cells rounding and detachment from culture surface. Morphologic and biochemical features of apoptosis, such as blebbing of the plasma membrane, translocation of phosphatidilserine to cell surface and annexin V positive staining, nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic bodies formation and DNA laddering, were detected in CCoV-infected cells. Propidium iodide staining of infected culture indicated the appearance of hypodiploid DNA peak corresponding to apoptotic cell population. Commonly to other animal coronavirus infection caspase-3 is likely to contribute to the execution phase of apoptosis induced by CCoV in A-72 cells since we found activation of enzymatic activity as well as procaspase-3 activating cleavage. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental as it causes cell and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory responses. Therefore in the case of CCoV associated gastroenteritis, apoptosis of epithelial mucosa cells may be responsible for pathology induced by CCoV infection.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruggieri, A.; Di Trani, L.; Gatto, I.; Franco, M.; Vignolo, E.; Bedini, B.; Elia, G.; Buonavoglia, C.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/844f3130ada716092ea078d26dc1bfed153ca025.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117493.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506005001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506005001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCoV infection","CCoV-infected cells","cell surface","case of CCoV","apoptotic cell population","Apoptotic death of infected cells","extensive cell death","apoptotic effect","canine fibrosarcoma cell line","cells morphology","homologous cell system","apoptosis of epithelial mucosa cells","apoptotic bodies formation","culture surface","Abstract Canine coronavirus","animal coronavirus infection caspase","Propidium iodide staining of infected culture","cultures canine coronaviruses","execution phase of apoptosis","biochemical features of apoptosis","DNA laddering","MTT assay","standard colorimetric assay","induction of cytopathic effect","annexin V positive staining","appearance of hypodiploid DNA peak","nuclear fragmentation","translocation of phosphatidilserine","severe enteritis","gastroenteritis","mild enteric illness","cellular proliferation","countries","blebbing","pathology","nature","reduced growth rate","plasma membrane","tissue destruction","procaspase","dogs","events","young pups","activation of enzymatic activity","inflammatory responses","detachment","activating cleavage","order"],"language":"en"},

SARS and MERS are manifested as severe atypical pneumonia associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans. The majority of studies carried out in SARS-CoV-infected humans and animals attribute a dysregulated/exuberant innate response as a leading contributor to SARS-CoV-mediated pathology. A decade after the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic, we do not have any approved preventive or therapeutic agents available in case of re-emergence of SARS-CoV or other related viruses. A strong neutralizing antibody response generated against the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is completely protective in the susceptible host. However, neutralizing antibody titers and the memory B cell response are short-lived in SARS-recovered patients and the antibody will target primary homologous strain. Interestingly, the acute phase of SARS in humans is associated with a severe reduction in the number of T cells in the blood. Surprisingly, only a limited number of studies have explored the role of the T cell-mediated adaptive immune response in respiratory coronavirus pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of anti-virus CD4 and CD8 T cells during respiratory coronavirus infections with a special emphasis on emerging coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Immunologic Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/048cc369889b330c580b3b1aee464cb07cc675f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4125530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-014-8534-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845462/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12026-014-8534-z.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","glycoprotein of SARS","SARS epidemic","MERS-CoV","acute phase of SARS","respiratory coronavirus infections","respiratory coronavirus pathogenesis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","Emerging respiratory coronaviruses","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","strong neutralizing antibody response","infected humans","number of T cells","CD8 T cells","adaptive immune response","memory B cell response","exuberant innate response","severe reduction","antibody titers","emerging coronaviruses","severe atypical pneumonia","limited number of studies","majority of studies","mediated pathology","role of anti-virus CD4","therapeutic agents available","case of re-emergence","leading contributor","high morbidity","animals","special emphasis","spike","approved preventive","potential biological threats","mortality","patients","primary homologous strain","blood","related viruses","susceptible host","review","decade"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the role of different particle size fractions with respect to respiratory health in Beijing, China. METHODS: Data on particle size distributions from 3 nm to 1 \u03BCm; PM(10) (PM \u2264 10 \u03BCm), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and sulfur dioxide concentrations; and meteorologic variables were collected daily from March 2004 to December 2006. Concurrently, daily counts of emergency room visits (ERV) for respiratory diseases were obtained from the Peking University Third Hospital. We estimated pollutant effects in single- and two-pollutant generalized additive models, controlling for meteorologic and other time-varying covariates. Time-delayed associations were estimated using polynomial distributed lag, cumulative effects, and single lag models. RESULTS: Associations of respiratory ERV with NO(2) concentrations and 100\u20131,000 nm particle number or surface area concentrations were of similar magnitude\u2014that is, approximately 5% increase in respiratory ERV with an interquartile range increase in air pollution concentration. In general, particles \u003C 50 nm were not positively associated with ERV, whereas particles 50\u2013100 nm were adversely associated with respiratory ERV, both being fractions of ultrafine particles. Effect estimates from two-pollutant models were most consistent for NO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Present levels of air pollution in Beijing were adversely associated with respiratory ERV. NO(2) concentrations seemed to be a better surrogate for evaluating overall respiratory health effects of ambient air pollution than PM(10) or particle number concentrations in Beijing.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leitte, Arne Marian; Schlink, Uwe; Herbarth, Olf; Wiedensohler, Alfred; Pan, Xiao-Chuan; Hu, Min; Richter, Matthia; Wehner, Birgit; Tuch, Thomas; Wu, Zhijun; Yang, Minjuan; Liu, Liqun; Breitner, Susanne; Cyrys, Josef; Peters, Annette; Wichmann, H.-Erich; Franck, Ulrich","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3574701bdaf6c4d408e9abe2d4176e058fc5208.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3080933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118783/; https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1002203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["Associations of respiratory ERV","respiratory morbidity","respiratory diseases","particle number concentrations","PM","respiratory health effects of ambient air pollution","nm particle number","Beijing","pollutant effects","sulfur dioxide concentrations","pollutant models","surface area concentrations","concentrations of particulate matter","particle size distributions","air pollution concentration","single lag models","cumulative effects","Present levels of air pollution","role of different particle size fractions","additive models","\u03BCm","ultrafine particles","Time-delayed associations","meteorologic variables","nitrogen dioxide","interquartile range increase","polynomial distributed lag","time-varying covariates","daily counts of emergency room visits","respect","better surrogate","link","similar magnitude","METHODS","Data","CONCLUSIONS","Peking University","study","Effect estimates","China","RESULTS","numerous studies","OBJECTIVES","aim","Hospital","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Promoting respiratory hygiene may reduce infection transmission. This formative research explored community perceptions about respiratory infections. METHODS: We conducted 34 in-depth interviews and 16 focus group discussions with community members and school children to explore respiratory hygiene related perceptions, practices, and social norms in an urban and a rural setting. We conducted unstructured observations on respiratory hygiene practices in public markets. RESULTS: Informants were not familiar with the term \u0022respiratory infection\u0022; most named diseases that had no relation to respiratory dysfunction. Informants reported that their community identified a number of \u0027good behaviors\u0027 related to respiratory hygiene, but they also noted, and we observed, that very few people practiced these. All informants cited hot/cold weather changes or using cold water as causes for catching cold. They associated transmission of respiratory infections with close contact with a sick person\u0027s breath, cough droplets, or spit; sharing a sick person\u0027s utensils and food. Informants suggested that avoiding such contact was the most effective method to prevent respiratory infection. Although informants perceived that handwashing after coughing or sneezing might prevent illness, they felt this was not typically feasible or practical. CONCLUSION: Community perceptions of respiratory infections include both concerns with imbalances between hot and cold, and with person-to-person transmission. Many people were aware of measures that could prevent respiratory infection, but did not practice them. Interventions that leverage community understanding of person-to-person transmission and that encourage the practice of their identified \u0027good behaviors\u0027 related to respiratory hygiene may reduce respiratory disease transmission.","publish_time":"2011-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nizame, Fosiul A; Nasreen, Sharifa; Unicomb, Leanne; Southern, Dorothy; Gurley, Emily S; Arman, Shaila; Kadir, Mohammad A; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Luby, Stephen P; Winch, Peter J","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ed7e985c1bef92952d4626090ac1c31c9566a23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3276487.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22136080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["transmission of respiratory infections","respiratory dysfunction","respiratory hygiene practices","respiratory disease transmission","Community perceptions of respiratory infections","respiratory hygiene related perceptions","Informants","infection transmission","person transmission","community members","cold water","cold weather changes","good behaviors\u0027","hot","people","sick person\u0027s breath","sick person\u0027s utensils","close contact","school children","focus group discussions","spit","concerns","leading cause of childhood deaths","in-depth interviews","cough droplets","social norms","imbalances","unstructured observations","public markets","named diseases","formative research","Bangladesh","relation","causes","effective method","term","CONCLUSION","aware of measures","food","number","BACKGROUND","rural setting","sneezing","METHODS","handwashing","RESULTS","Interventions","illness"],"language":"en"},

However, there is little evidence of porcine GCRV infections or of their genetic diversity in South Korea. We examined 137 diarrheic fecal specimens from 55 farms collected from six provinces. RT-PCR utilizing primer pairs specific for the GCRV VP6 gene detected GCRV-positive reactions in 36 (26.2%) diarrheic fecal samples. Of these, 17 samples (12.4%) tested positive for porcine GCRVs alone and 19 samples (13.8%) were also positive for other pathogens. Other enteric pathogens except for GCRV were detected in 64 feces samples (46.7%) and no enteric pathogens were evident in 37 feces samples (27.0%). Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses of GCRV partial VP6 gene between 23 Korean and other known porcine GCRVs demonstrated that Korean strains belonged to the porcine lineage. Furthermore, one Korean porcine strain shared the highest nucleotide (89.7\u201389.0%) and deduced amino acid sequence (92.9\u201393.9%) identities with bovine GCRV strains and was placed in the bovine GCRV lineage indicative of bovine origin. In conclusion, porcine GCRV infections are widespread in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. The infecting porcine GCRVs mostly belong to the porcine lineage with the exception of one bovine-like GCRV, which possibly originated from bovine GCRV due to interspecies transmission.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeong, Young-Ju; Park, Sang-Ik; Hosmillo, Myra; Shin, Dong-Jun; Chun, Young-Hyun; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Kang, Shien-Young; Woo, Sang-Kyu; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, Gye-Yeop; Kang, Mun-Il; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a3b7a523852b2547e7ca38a08c4b8392e7762ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117287.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509001539; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.03.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362434/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509001539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GCRV"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["bovine GCRV strains","porcine lineage","GCRV VP6 gene","GCRV-positive reactions","known porcine GCRVs","infecting porcine GCRVs","little evidence of porcine GCRV infections","bovine GCRV lineage indicative of bovine origin","Korean porcine strain","feces samples","diarrheic fecal samples","sequence homology analyses of GCRV partial VP6 gene","Korean strains","enteric pathogens","possible zoonotic role of GCRVs","South Korea","diarrheic fecal specimens","cause acute diarrhea","deduced amino acid sequence","piglets","primer pairs specific","humans","Abstract Group C rotaviruses","genetic diversity","animals","RT-PCR","farms","highest nucleotide","conclusion","exception","interspecies transmission","identities","provinces"],"language":"en"},

Admissions associated with proven influenza and parainfluenza infections accounted for 2% of PICU annual admissions. There was only one death in 2003. 51% of these patients required ventilatory support, 45% received systemic corticosteroids, and 91% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Bacterial co-infections were identified in 25% of these patients. The incidence of influenza admissions had not increased significantly in 2009 (H1N1 pandemic) when compared with 2003 (SARS epidemic) (p = 0.3). There were only two PICU cases of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 and both survived. The annual incidence of severe PICU cases of influenza and parainfluenza were 0.94 and 0.88 per 100,000 children per annum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic H1N1, influenza and parainfluenza viruses may be associated with significant childhood morbidity and PICU admissions.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Ting Fan; Cheung, Kam Lau; Ng, Pak Cheung; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung","journal":"Indian J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b31dbe1ca814b75475067715939c8ec944a17753.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20882437/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-010-0197-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parainfluenza admissions","proven influenza","incidence of influenza admissions","influenza B","parainfluenza infections","PICU admissions","parainfluenza viruses","Parainfluenza type","PICU annual admissions","annual incidence of severe PICU cases of influenza","laboratory proven diagnosis of influenza","PICU cases of pandemic H1N1","commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection","H1N1 pandemic","young children","patients","median age of children","significant childhood morbidity","Bacterial co-infections","pediatric intensive care unit","initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage","vs","ventilatory support","systemic corticosteroids","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Retrospective study","SARS epidemic","RESULTS","year period","OBJECTIVES","annum","death"],"language":"en"},

The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods : A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results : We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions : The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiao; Zhu, Xiaobin; Fu, Shuai; Hu, Yugang; Li, Xiaoning; Xiao, Jinsong","journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd8930bc2412e84aab6ccb45060aaa0b43cd800a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720307928; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720307928?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["depression of HCW","Stress levels of HCW","psychological levels of HCW","depression levels","psychological stress","situation of HCW","Depression scale","prevalence of stress","levels of contact history","Hospital Anxiety","symptoms of anxiety","high percentages of HCW","Perceived Stress Scale","independent risk factors","COVID","psychological morbidities","psychological intervention targets","job titles","different gender","degrees of protective measures","epidemic","China","Psychology related factors","intermediate title","intervention service","female participants","correlation","outbreak","pneumonia","PSS","multiple centers","years of work experience","healthcare workers","new coronavirus","respondents","cross-sectional survey","Methods","Abstract Background","Wuhan","present study","Conclusions","SARS","effective responses","Results"],"language":"en"},

The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex.

The viral nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the ORF1 polyprotein induce vesical clusters harboring the viral replication sites. Little is known so far about the ultrastructure of these replication organelles or the contribution of individual NS proteins to their biogenesis. We compared the ultrastructural changes induced by expression of norovirus ORF1 polyproteins with those induced upon infection with murine norovirus (MNV). Characteristic membrane alterations induced by ORF1 expression resembled those found in MNV infected cells, consisting of vesicle accumulations likely built from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which included single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs). In-depth analysis using electron tomography suggested that MMVs originate through the enwrapping of SMVs with tubular structures similar to mechanisms reported for picornaviruses. Expression of GII.4 NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 fused to GFP revealed distinct membrane alterations when analyzed by correlative light and electron microscopy. Expression of NS1-2 induced proliferation of smooth ER membranes forming long tubular structures that were affected by mutations in the active center of the putative NS1-2 hydrolase domain. NS3 was associated with ER membranes around lipid droplets (LDs) and induced the formation of convoluted membranes, which were even more pronounced in case of NS4. Interestingly, NS4 was the only GII.4 protein capable of inducing SMV and DMV formation when expressed individually. Our work provides the first ultrastructural analysis of norovirus GII.4 induced vesicle clusters and suggests that their morphology and biogenesis is most similar to picornaviruses. We further identified NS4 as a key factor in the formation of membrane alterations of huNoV and provide models of the putative membrane topologies of NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 to guide future studies.","publish_time":"2017-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doerflinger, Sylvie Y.; Cortese, Mirko; Romero-Brey, In\u00E9s; Menne, Zach; Tubiana, Thibault; Schenk, Christian; White, Peter A.; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Bressanelli, St\u00E9phane; Hansman, Grant S.; Lohmann, Volker","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/935756bf06b19a49b630e94159b2099e9b582268.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5678787.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFP","SMV","DMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Expression of NS1","Expression of GII","formation of membrane alterations of huNoV","multi membrane vesicles","double membrane vesicles","single membrane vesicles","distinct membrane alterations","Characteristic membrane alterations","putative membrane topologies of NS1","ORF1 expression","induced vesicle clusters","putative NS1","NS3","case of NS4","induced proliferation of smooth ER membranes","expression of norovirus ORF1 polyproteins","ultrastructural analysis of norovirus GII","formation of convoluted membranes","tubular structures similar","DMV formation","murine norovirus","MMVs","biogenesis","picornaviruses","viral replication sites","vesical clusters","enwrapping of SMVs","vesicle accumulations","contribution of individual NS proteins","replication organelles","In-depth analysis","electron tomography","ultrastructural changes","electron microscopy","MNV infected cells","DMVs","models","protein capable of inducing SMV","correlative light","frequent cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis","genogroup","infection","LDs","mechanisms","GFP","key factor","mutations","endoplasmic reticulum","active center","lipid droplets","morphology","genotype","hydrolase domain","future studies","Human noroviruses","ultrastructure","work","variants"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted as part of the calf component of the National Animal Health Monitoring System\u0027s Dairy 2014 study, which included 104 dairy operations in 13 states. The calf component was an 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning; data were collected on 2,545 calves. The percentage morbidity for all calves enrolled in the study was 33.9%. Backward elimination model selection was used after univariate screening to determine which management practices and environmental factors significantly affected morbidity and mortality. The final morbidity model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, ventilation type, and average temperature-humidity index (THI) during the preweaning period. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower predicted risk of morbidity than calves with a lower birth weight. An increase in serum IgG concentration was associated with decreased morbidity. Calves housed in positive- or cross-ventilated systems had a 2.2 times higher odds of developing disease compared with calves housed in natural ventilation systems. Average THI during the preweaning period was inversely correlated with morbidity; as THI increased, the predicted morbidity risk decreased. The percent mortality for all calves enrolled in the study was 5.0%. The final mortality model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, amount of fat/day in the liquid diet, and morbidity. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower risk of mortality. An increase in serum IgG concentration decreased the risk of mortality. The odds of mortality were 3.1 times higher in calves fed \u22640.15 kg of fat/d in the liquid diet compared with calves fed \u22650.22 kg of fat/d. The odds of mortality were 4.7 times higher in calves that experienced any disease throughout the preweaning period than in calves with no disease. In summary, morbidity and mortality were both associated with birth weight and serum IgG concentration. Additionally, morbidity was associated with ventilation type and average monthly THI, and mortality was associated with amount of fat per day in the liquid diet and morbidity.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Urie, N.

These methods have had a positive impact in the field of virology and helped to further our knowledge of how viruses invade cells. Nearly all positive-strand RNA viruses propagate their viral genomes in part through intracellular membranes. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, accumulates viral RNA that forms replication complexes (RCs) in infected cells. In this study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), we dissected PRRSV-induced membrane structures in infected cells and determined the correlations between PRRSV particles and vesicles stimulated by PRRSV to understand the structural and dynamic aspects of PRRSV infection. METHODS: We identified the appropriate time point by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The co-localization of viruses and organelles was determined by immunofluorescence and immune-electron microscopy (IEM). The ultrastructure of cells infected by PRRSV was observed using EM and electron tomography (ET). RESULTS: In our study, we found that PRRSV dsRNA was located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagosomes; in addition, the N protein was located at the mitochondria, ER and autophagosomes. Vesicles induced by PRRSV appeared at 16 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) and increased in size with time during the infection period. In addition, our findings demonstrated that the virus vesicles originated from the ER, and these two organelle structures connected with each other to form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) that provided a site for virus replication and assembly. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that membrane vesicles induced by PRRSV were derived from the ER. The vesicles may provide a location for PRRSV replication and assembly.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wei; Chen, Keren; Zhang, Xueqing; Guo, Chunhe; Chen, Yaosheng; Liu, Xiaohong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14ae1c8c866fcbdad5e965f296a90a8cbf41f689.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6057628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30040832/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200919","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV replication","PRRSV dsRNA","PRRSV particles","PRRSV-induced membrane structures","virus vesicles","virus-infected cells","dynamic aspects of PRRSV infection","virus replication","membrane vesicles","ultrastructure of cells","viral RNA","viral genomes","viral invasion","respiratory syndrome virus","immunofluorescence","replication complexes","immune-electron microscopy","positive-strand RNA viruses","electron tomography","organelle structures","autophagosomes","infection period","study","assembly","addition","methods","RESULTS","appearance of specialized structures","co-localization of viruses","hours post-infection","positive impact","appropriate time point","TCID50","organelles","RCs","correlations","qRT-PCR","tissue culture infectious dose","endoplasmic reticulum","mitochondria","site","Arterivirus","location","imaging techniques","field of virology","N protein","RVN","Western blotting","intracellular membranes","size","IEM","knowledge","findings","reticulovesicular network","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In September 2003, prior to these recommendations, eight HCWs at a Pennsylvania tertiary-care hospital developed respiratory symptoms after exposure to an infant with pertussis. We observed that HCWs did not routinely wear masks while caring for patients with cough illness. Anticipating the new recommendations and in an effort to understand potential barriers for implementation, we evaluated perceptions of mask use among HCWs in this hospital. METHODS: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with two groups of nurses and one group of physicians (n1=4, n2=6, n3=9). Based on the discussions, we developed a structured, self-administered questionnaire for distribution to all HCWs present during two consecutive hospital shifts. RESULTS: Overall, 96 of 120 (80%) HCWs responded. Forty-nine (51%) respondents viewed coughing patients as potentially contagious to other patients and HCWs, and 67 (70%) believed that they and their patients would be protected against droplet infections by masks. Forty-three (45%) HCWs perceived obstacles to using mask. Masks were considered a barrier to a trusting provider-patient relationship: 20 HCWs felt that a provider in a mask increased worries among patients, and 26 thought that the mask was a barrier to communicating with patients. Thirty respondents indicated that wearing a mask was uncomfortable and/or a burden. HCWs were less likely to perceive obstacles if they recognized a risk for patient-to-patient transmission (27/35 versus 31/61; P=0.0095). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest several potential barriers among HCWs to mask use, despite a recent pertussis outbreak in the hospital. HCWs may benefit from education regarding the risk of nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens such as SARS, influenza, and pertussis. Patients should be educated on the benefits of HCW mask use and its association with quality medical care.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calugar\u2217, A.; Oakes, L.; Ahmed, A.; Jahre, J.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the scientific output of dengue research in Arab countries relative to that worldwide by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: The standardized search approach based on the use of the the keyword \u201Cdengue\u201D in the title, abstract, and keyword field was used to get research output related to dengue at a global level. All data related to dengue were collected from the past to December 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 19,581 dengue-related documents identified in the Scopus database. The results show that the study of dengue exhibits an overall upward trend from 1872 to 2015 with peak publications in 2014. The leading countries in dengue research were the USA (4,709; 24.05 %), India (1,942; 9.92 %), Brazil (1,530; 7.81 %), Thailand (1,260; 6.43 %), the UK (1,129; 5.77 %), and France (1,087; 5.55 %). Only 226 (1.16 % of the overall global research effort in the dengue field) articles were published from the Arab region. The total number of citations for all publications was 352,710, with an average of 18.0 citations per publication. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 186. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the most productive country in Arab region with 102 documents representing 45.1 %. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 27. The USA was Arab\u2019s most main cooperative partner (46, 20.4 %), followed by India (36, 15.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of literature related to dengue research has considerably increased over the last decade. This bibliometric analysis has demonstrated the leading role that the USA, India, Brazil, Thailand, the UK, and France play in dengue research. The Arab world produced fewer publications related to dengue with lower quality than other world countries.","publish_time":"2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d09812aba24146255e664c9ed4ed7d5dcd9e3b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4859974.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0534-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27154247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","USA"],"locations":["Asia","Americas","Africa","Thailand","France","Saudi Arabia","India","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["dengue field","study of dengue","dengue-related documents","scientific output of dengue research","research output","overall global research effort","USA","world countries","leading countries","Arab countries relative","Arab world","Arab region","India","extracted data","keyword field","fewer publications","peak publications","h-index","UK","Thailand","bibliometric analysis","Brazil","RESULTS","total number of citations","leading role","global level","France play","overall upward trend","western Pacific","southeast Africa","Americas","lower quality","KSA","transmission","use","title","articles","productive country","eastern Mediterranean regions","re-emerging arboviral infection","standardized search approach","widespread public health problem","Arab\u2019s","main cooperative partner","Asia","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","METHODS","average","BACKGROUND","Scopus database","literature","CONCLUSIONS","aim","past","decade"],"language":"en"},

The aberrant activity of proteases can lead to various diseases; consequently, host proteases have been the focus of intense investigation as potential therapeutic targets. A wide range of viruses encode proteases which play an essential role in viral replication and, therefore, constitute attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics. There are numerous examples of successful drug development targeting cellular and viral proteases, including antivirals against human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. Most FDA-approved antiviral agents are peptidomimetics and macrocyclic compounds that interact with the active site of a targeted protease. Norovirus proteases are cysteine proteases that contain a chymotrypsin-like fold in their 3D structures. This review focuses on our group\u2019s efforts related to the development of norovirus protease inhibitors as potential anti-norovirus therapeutics. These protease inhibitors are rationally designed transition-state inhibitors encompassing dipeptidyl, tripeptidyl and macrocyclic compounds. Highly effective inhibitors validated in X-ray co-crystallization, enzyme and cell-based assays, as well as an animal model, were generated by launching an optimization campaign utilizing the initial hit compounds. A prodrug approach was also explored to improve the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the identified inhibitors.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Kim, Yunjeong; Lovell, Scott; Rathnayake, Athri D.; Groutas, William C.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bf3d561863300dbcb9ba92ad94807dfb8775f7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6410195.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Norovirus proteases","viral proteases","host proteases","cysteine proteases","development of norovirus protease inhibitors","effective inhibitors","identified inhibitors","aberrant activity of proteases","macrocyclic compounds","development of antiviral therapeutics","designed transition-state inhibitors","potential anti-norovirus therapeutics","targeted protease","potential therapeutic targets","initial hit compounds","wide range of viruses","viral replication","antiviral agents","attractive targets","numerous examples of successful drug development","human immunodeficiency virus","hepatitis C virus","major enzyme group","wide variety of biological processes","antivirals","life forms","important roles","X-ray co-crystallization","focus of intense investigation","peptidomimetics","cell-based assays","active site","essential role","various diseases","optimization campaign","group\u2019s efforts","fold","FDA","mammalians","PK","chymotrypsin","D structures","pharmacokinetics","review","animal model","prodrug approach"],"language":"en"},

To further investigate the possible roles of S2 in SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis and pathogenesis of SARS, we characterized the host expression profiles induced upon S2 over-expression in Vero E6 cells by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Possible activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in S2 expressing cells was suggested, as evidenced by the up-regulation of cytochrome c and down-regulation of the Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic members.

Despite the tremendous value conferred by currently available vaccines toward public health, the implementation of additional vaccine platforms is also of key importance. In fact, currently available vaccines possess shortcomings, such as inefficient triggering of a cell-mediated immune response and the lack of protective mucosal immunity. In this regard, recent work has been focused on vaccine delivery systems, as an alternative to injectable vaccines, to increase antigen stability and improve overall immunogenicity. In particular, novel strategies based on edible or intradermal vaccine formulations have been demonstrated to trigger both a systemic and mucosal immune response. These novel vaccination delivery systems offer several advantages over the injectable preparations including self-administration, reduced cost, stability, and elimination of a cold chain. In this review, the latest findings and accomplishments regarding edible and intradermal vaccines are described in the context of the system used for immunogen expression, their molecular features and capacity to induce a protective systemic and mucosal response.","publish_time":"2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Criscuolo, E.; Caputo, V.; Diotti, R.

The aim of this study was to design and validate a questionnaire to measure the attitude of hospital staff toward work attendance during an influenza pandemic. METHOD: An online questionnaire was designed and electronically distributed to the staff of a teaching medical institution in the United Kingdom. The questionnaire was designed de novo following discussions with colleagues at Imperial College and with reference to the literature on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. The questionnaire included 15 independent fact variables and 33 dependent measure variables. A total of 367 responses were received in this survey. RESULTS: The data from the measurement variables were not normally distributed. Three different methods (standardized residuals, Mahalanobis distance and Cook\u0027s distance) were used to identify the outliers. In all, 19 respondents (5.17%) were identified as outliers and were excluded. The responses to this questionnaire had a wide range of missing data, from 1 to 74 cases in the measured variables. To improve the quality of the data, missing value analysis, using Expectation Maximization Algorithm (EMA) with a non-normal distribution model, was applied to the responses. The collected data were checked for homoscedasticity and multicollinearity of the variables. These tests suggested that some of the questions should be merged. In the last step, the reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated. This process showed that three questions reduced the reliability of the questionnaire. Removing those questions helped to achieve the desired level of reliability. CONCLUSION: With the changes proposed in this article, the questionnaire for measuring staff attitudes concerning pandemic influenza can be converted to a standardized and validated questionnaire to properly measure the expectations and attendance of healthcare staff in the event of pandemic flu.","publish_time":"2012-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naghavi, Seyed Hamid Reza; Shabestari, Omid; Roudsari, Abdul V.; Harrison, John","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f9fa006a1bca13cf8c83d29118ff4f067fd5e19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102719.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2011.11.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034111001365; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034111001365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cook"],"organizations":["Imperial College","Expectation Maximization Algorithm"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["validated questionnaire","online questionnaire","attendance of healthcare staff","attitude of healthcare staff","staff attitudes","measurement variables","measured variables","dependent measure variables","questions","responses","attitude of hospital staff","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","collected data","independent fact variables","healthcare sector","wide range of missing data","outliers","event of pandemic flu","desired level of reliability","Mahalanobis distance","standardized residuals","work attendance","Cook\u0027s distance","missing value analysis","crucial factors","EMA","sickness","severe acute respiratory syndrome","literature","emergency preparedness","Expectation Maximization Algorithm","colleagues","Imperial College","reference","SARS","teaching medical institution","discussions","expectations","resource allocation","different methods","non-normal distribution model","pandemics","rate of absence","United Kingdom","epidemic","higher workload","novo","homoscedasticity","quality","cases","multicollinearity","article","changes","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","step","aim","study","CONCLUSION","total","survey","tests","process","respondents"],"language":"en"},

Infrared thermography (IRT) is a fast, passive, non-contact and non-invasive alternative to conventional clinical thermometers for monitoring body temperature. Besides, IRT can also map body surface temperature remotely. Last five decades witnessed a steady increase in the utility of thermal imaging cameras to obtain correlations between the thermal physiology and skin temperature. IRT has been successfully used in diagnosis of breast cancer, diabetes neuropathy and peripheral vascular disorders. It has also been used to detect problems associated with gynecology, kidney transplantation, dermatology, heart, neonatal physiology, fever screening and brain imaging. With the advent of modern infrared cameras, data acquisition and processing techniques, it is now possible to have real time high resolution thermographic images, which is likely to surge further research in this field. The present efforts are focused on automatic analysis of temperature distribution of regions of interest and their statistical analysis for detection of abnormalities. This critical review focuses on advances in the area of medical IRT. The basics of IRT, essential theoretical background, the procedures adopted for various measurements and applications of IRT in various medical fields are discussed in this review. Besides background information is provided for beginners for better understanding of the subject.","publish_time":"2012-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lahiri, B.

The enzymatic activity and three-dimensional structure of some Endou proteins have been previously reported. However, their molecular structure and gene expression patterns during embryogenesis remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we took zebrafish (Danio rerio) endouC as the model to study molecular structure and gene expression dynamics at different developmental stages. Zebrafish endouC cDNA contains 930 base pairs encoding 309 amino acid residues, sharing 27%, 27%, 27%, and 25% identity with that of human, mouse, chicken and frog, respectively. A phylogenetic tree showed that zebrafish EndouA was clustered with vertebrate Endou groups, while zebrafish EndouB and EndouC were found to belong to a unique monophyletic group. Furthermore, the endouC transcript was detected in one-cell embryos, suggesting that it is a maternal gene. While the endouC transcript was only weakly present at early developmental stages, its expression was greatly increased in embryos from 18 to 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) and then decreased after 72 hpf. Finally, endouC was ubiquitously expressed throughout the whole embryo during early embryogenesis, but its expression was enriched in brain, eyes and fin buds from 24 to 96 hpf.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hung-Chieh; Fu, Chuan-Yang; Zeng, Chih-Wei; Tsai, Huai-Jen","journal":"Gene Expression Patterns","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91a27c0a3a3ae3d932c2e154ec9a672a0e97631d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118454.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2017.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567133X17300960; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567133X17300960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endouC transcript","Zebrafish endouC cDNA","hpf","gene expression dynamics","gene expression patterns","molecular structure","zebrafish EndouA","zebrafish EndouB","Abstract Endou proteins","vertebrate Endou groups","three-dimensional structure","early developmental stages","early embryogenesis","maternal gene","different developmental stages","Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family of enzymes","weakly present","cell embryos","present high sequence homology","base pairs","model","founding member XendoU domain","human","mouse","amino acid residues","fin buds","brain","eyes","Danio rerio","h post-fertilization","enzymatic activity","chicken","frog","phylogenetic tree","unique monophyletic group","identity"],"language":"en"},

There are numerous serotypes and variants, which do not confer cross protection resulting in failure of currently used IBV vaccines. Although variant IBV isolates with major genetic differences have been subjected to comparative studies, it is unknown whether minor genetic differences in IBV variants within a serotype are different in terms of pathogenesis and eliciting host responses. Two Massachusetts (Mass) variant IBV isolates recovered from commercial layer flocks in the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK) were compared genetically and evaluated for their pathogenicity, tissue distribution and ability to recruit and replicate in macrophages. RESULTS: Although whole genome sequencing of these two Mass IBV isolates showed low similarity with the M41 vaccinal strain, they had an identical nucleotide sequence at open reading frames (ORFs) 3a, 3b, envelop (E), matrix (M), 5a and 5b. The rest of the ORFs of these 2 IBV isolates showed 99.9% nucleotide similarity. However, upon experimental infection, we found that the IBV isolate originating from AB was different to the one that originated in SK due to higher tracheal lesion scores and lower lung viral replication and lower genome loads in cecal tonsils. Nevertheless, both IBV isolates elicited host responses characterized by significant macrophage recruitment to the respiratory tract and there was evidence that both IBV isolates replicated within tracheal and lung macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study shows that Mass variant IBV isolates, although possessing minor genetic variations, can lead to significant differences in pathogenicity in young chickens. Further studies are required to investigate the pathogenicity of these two Mass variant IBV isolates in laying hens.

Vaccination with LBSap induced a prominent type 1 immune response that was characterized by increased levels of interleukin (IL-) 12 and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) upon stimulation with soluble vaccine antigen. Importantly, results showed that this type of responsiveness was sustained after challenge infection; at day 90 and 885 after L. chagasi challenge infection, PBMCs from LBSap vaccinated dogs produced more IL-12, IFN-\u03B3 and concomitant nitric oxide (NO) when stimulated with Leishmania antigens as compared to PBMCs from respective control groups (saponin, LB- treated, or non-treated control dogs). Moreover, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B2 decreased in the supernatant of SLcA-stimulated PBMCs in the LBSap group at 90 days.

Endogenous viral elements in host genomes provide separate evidence that viruses similar to many major contemporary groups circulated 100 million years ago or earlier. In this Opinion article, we argue that the extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences is best explained by a niche-filling model in which fitness optimization is rapidly achieved in their specific hosts. Whereas short-term substitution rates reflect the accumulation of tolerated sequence changes within adapted genomes, longer-term rates increasingly resemble those of their hosts as the evolving niche moulds and effectively imprisons the virus in co-adapted virus\u2013host relationships. Contrastingly, viruses that jump hosts undergo strong and stringent adaptive selection as they maximize their fit to their new niche. This adaptive capability may paradoxically create evolutionary stasis in long-term host relationships. While viruses can evolve and adapt rapidly, their hosts may ultimately shape their longer-term evolution.","publish_time":"2018-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simmonds, Peter; Aiewsakun, Pakorn; Katzourakis, Aris","journal":"Nat Rev Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50d939826e1c19d2a624b0d42f8f30788b983973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518814/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0120-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host genomes","viruses similar","specific hosts","co-adapted virus","adapted genomes","long-term host relationships","longer-term rates","new niche","years","niche-filling model","evolving niche moulds","extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences","Recent discoveries of contemporary genotypes of hepatitis B virus","adaptive capability","longer-term evolution","major contemporary groups","short-term substitution rates","stringent adaptive selection","ancient human remains","parvovirus B19","accumulation of tolerated sequence changes","separate evidence","evolutionary stasis","little genetic change","Endogenous viral elements","fitness optimization","Opinion article"],"language":"en"},

This production environment could add stressors affecting the health and growth of animals. Major stressors can include environment (air quality and temperature), nutrition, and infection. These stressors can reduce growth performance and alter immune systems at systemic and local levels including the gastrointestinal tract. Heat stress increases the permeability, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in the gut. Nutritional stress from fasting, antinutritional compounds, and toxins induces the leakage and destruction of the tight junction proteins in the gut. Fasting is shown to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas deoxynivalenol increases the recruitment of intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines and the level of lymphocytes in the gut. Pathogenic and viral infections such as Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus can lead to loosening the intestinal epithelial barrier. On the other hand, supplementation of Lactobacillus or Saccharaomyces reduced infectious stress by ETEC. It was noted that major stressors altered the permeability of intestinal barriers and profiles of genes and proteins of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mucosal system in pigs. However, it is not sufficient to fully explain the mechanism of the gut immune system in pigs under stress conditions. Correlation and interaction of gut and systemic immune system under major stressors should be better defined to overcome aforementioned obstacles.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, In Kyu; Kye, Yoon Chul; Kim, Girak; Kim, Han Wool; Gu, Min Jeong; Umboh, Johnny; Maaruf, Kartini; Kim, Sung Woo; Yun, Cheol-Heui","journal":"Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/818b42cf815357fc1ee73a17caa5dfef24c55027.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4932560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27189643/; https://doi.org/10.5713/ajas.16.0118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Major stressors","gut immune system","proteins of pro-inflammatory cytokines","oxidative stress","infectious stress","Nutritional stress","stress conditions","Heat stress","interaction of gut","recruitment of intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines","systemic immune system","inflammatory responses","production environment","immune systems","mucosal system","permeability of intestinal barriers","ETEC","pigs","production efficiency","fasting","intestinal epithelial barrier","Modern livestock production","growth performance","growth of animals","tight junction proteins","chemokines","profiles of genes","coli","local levels","Saccharaomyces","deoxynivalenol","antinutritional compounds","air quality","leakage","temperature","toxins","destruction","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","level of lymphocytes","supplementation of Lactobacillus","viral infections","health","mechanism","gastrointestinal tract","hand","Correlation","aforementioned obstacles"],"language":"en"},

Q\u03B2 belongs to the family of Leviviridae and is found throughout the world (bacterial isolates and sewage). The genome of Q\u03B2 is about 4.2 kb, coding for four proteins. This genome is surrounded by 180 copies of coat proteins (capsomers) each comprised of 132 residues of amino acids. The other proteins, the subunit II (\u03B2) of a replicase, the maturation protein (A(2)) and the read-through or minor coat protein (A(1)), play a key role in phage infection. With the replicase protein, which lacks proofreading activity, as well as its short replication time, and high population size, Q\u03B2 phage has attractive features for in vitro evolution. The A(1) protein gene shares the same initiation codon with the coat protein gene and is produced during translation when the coat protein\u2019s UGA stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan. Thus, A(1) is termed the read-through protein. This RNA phage platform technology not only serves to display foreign peptides but is also exceptionally suited to address questions about in vitro evolution. The C-terminus of A(1) protein confers to this RNA phage platform an exceptional feature of not only a linker for foreign peptide to be displayed also a model for evolution. This platform was used to present a peptide library of the G-H loop of the capsid region P1 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) called VP1 protein. The library was exposed on the exterior surface of Q\u03B2 phages, evolved and selected with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SD6 of the FMDV. These hybrid phages could principally be good candidates for FMDV vaccine development. Separately, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epitopes was fused with the A(1) proteins and exposed on the Q\u03B2 phage exterior surface. The engineered phages with MPER epitopes were recognized by anti-MPER specific antibodies. This system could be used to overcome the challenge of effective presentation of MPER to the immune system. A key portion of this linear epitope could be randomized and evolved with the Q\u03B2 system. Overall, antigens and epitopes of RNA viruses relevant to public health can be randomized, evolved and selected in pools using the proposed Q\u03B2 model to overcome their plasticity and the challenge of vaccine development. Major epitopes of a particular virus can be engineered or displayed on the Q\u03B2 phage surface and used for vaccine efficacy evaluation, thus avoiding the use of live viruses.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singleton, Rana L.; Sanders, Carrie A.; Jones, Kevin; Thorington, Bobby; Egbo, Timothy; Coats, Mamie T.; Waffo, Alain Bopda","journal":"Methods Protoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc3262c27f701261cfc1b27bc0495f6bd8b3e3fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6526423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164561/; https://doi.org/10.3390/mps1020018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV","MPER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Q\u03B2 phage surface","Q\u03B2 system","genome of Q\u03B2","Q\u03B2 phage exterior surface","replicase protein","read-through protein","coat protein gene","VP1 protein","maturation protein","minor coat protein","exterior surface of Q\u03B2 phages","MPER epitopes","proposed Q\u03B2 model","phage infection","RNA phage platform technology","copies of coat proteins","evolution","epitopes of RNA viruses relevant","FMDV vaccine development","Major epitopes","engineered phages","challenge of vaccine development","challenge of effective presentation of MPER","anti-MPER specific antibodies","initiation codon","particular virus","coat protein\u2019s UGA","peptide library","hybrid phages","immune system","single-stranded RNA bacteriophage","mouth disease virus","vaccine efficacy evaluation","human immunodeficiency virus type","codon triplet","monoclonal antibodies","key portion","key role","foreign peptides","capsid region P1","use of live viruses","membrane proximal external region","high population size","G-H loop","foot","good candidates","plasticity","attractive features","short replication time","HIV","translation","exceptional feature","public health","low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan","world","linker","mAbs","SD6","capsomers","antigens","proofreading activity","bacterial isolates","sewage","nm icosahedral shell","linear epitope","nucleotides","pools","family of Leviviridae","residues of amino acids","address questions","subunit","coding","C-terminus"],"language":"en"},

The only current therapeutic option is maintenance of a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which implies substantial burden for CD patients. Different treatment regimes might be feasible, including masking of toxic celiac peptides with blocking antibodies or fragments thereof. The objective of this study was therefore to select and produce a recombinant avian single-chain fragment variable (scFv) directed against peptic-tryptic digested gliadin (PT-Gliadin) and related celiac toxic entities. RESULTS: Gluten-free raised chicken of same age were immunized with PT-Gliadin. Chicken splenic lymphocytes, selected with antigen-coated magnetic beads, served as RNA source for the generation of cDNA. Chicken V(H) and V(L) genes were amplified from the cDNA by PCR to generate full-length scFv constructs consisting of V(H) and V(L) fragments joined by a linker sequence. ScFv constructs were ligated in a prokaryotic expression vector, which provides a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. ScFvs from several bacterial clones were expressed in soluble form and crude cell lysates screened for binding to PT-Gliadin by ELISA. We identified an enriched scFv motif, which showed reactivity to PT-Gliadin. One selected scFv candidate was expressed and purified to homogeneity. Polyclonal anti-PT-Gliadin IgY, purified from egg yolk of immunized chicken, served as control. ScFv binds in a dose-dependent manner to PT-Gliadin, comparable to IgY. Furthermore, IgY competitively displaces scFv from PT-Gliadin and natural wheat flour digest, indicating a common epitope of scFv and IgY. ScFv was tested for reactivity to different gastric digested dietary grain flours. ScFv detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range, while rye is detected to a lesser extent. Notably, barley and cereals which are part of the gluten-free diet, like corn and rice, are not detected by scFv. Similarly, the pseudo-grain amaranth, used as gluten-free alternative, is not targeted by scFv. This data indicate that scFv specifically recognizes toxic cereal peptides relevant in CD. CONCLUSION: ScFv can be of benefit for future CD treatment regimes.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stadlmann, Valerie; Harant, Hanna; Korschineck, Irina; Hermann, Marcela; Forster, Florian; Missbichler, Albert","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c75ed4c49d52ac5862313eb9d22cad197df1c138.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4666168.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0223-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26625857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common epitope of scFv","full-length scFv constructs","selected scFv candidate","enriched scFv motif","Polyclonal anti-PT-Gliadin","Chicken V","dietary gluten","Gluten-free raised chicken","gluten-free alternative","peptic-tryptic digested gliadin","Celiac disease","CD patients","strict life-long gluten-free diet","masking of toxic celiac peptides","related celiac toxic entities","future CD treatment regimes","reactivity","Different treatment regimes","Chicken splenic lymphocytes","fragments","egg yolk of immunized chicken","toxic cereal peptides relevant","different gastric digested dietary grain flours","binding affinities","khorasan wheat","related prolamins","generation of cDNA","pseudo-grain amaranth","natural wheat flour digest","small intestinal inflammatory disease","soluble form","maintenance","recombinant avian single-chain fragment variable","benefit","crude cell lysates","blocking antibodies","rye","RNA source","high nanomolar range","antigen","substantial burden","age","dose-dependent manner","bacterial clones","magnetic beads","current therapeutic option","PCR","corn","rice","RESULTS","prokaryotic expression vector","C-terminal hexahistidine tag","BACKGROUND","ELISA","lesser extent","ScFvs","linker sequence","cereals","control","genes","CONCLUSION","data","objective","study","barley","homogeneity"],"language":"en"},

This preliminary prospective study aimed to assess whether urine metabolomic analysis can be used to identify children with bronchiolitis who are at risk of developing recurrent wheezing. METHODS: Fifty-two infants \u003C1 year old treated in the emergency department at University Hospital of Padova for acute bronchiolitis were enrolled (77% tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Follow-up visits were conducted for 2 years after the episode of bronchiolitis. Untargeted metabolomic analyses based on mass spectrometry were performed on urine samples collected from infants with acute bronchiolitis. Data modeling was based on univariate and multivariate data analyses. RESULTS: We distinguished children with and those without postbronchiolitis recurrent wheeze, defined as \u22653 episodes of physician-diagnosed wheezing. Pathway overrepresentation analysis pointed to a major involvement of the citric acid cycle (P \u003C .001) and some amino acids (lysine, cysteine, and methionine; P \u2264 .015) in differentiating between these 2 groups of children. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing that metabolomic profiling of urine specimens from infants with bronchiolitis can be used to identify children at increased risk of developing recurrent wheezing.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barlotta, Alessia; Pirillo, Paola; Stocchero, Matteo; Donato, Filippo; Giordano, Giuseppe; Bont, Louis; Zanconato, Stefania; Carraro, Silvia; Baraldi, Eugenio","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1168eacbf2cb706b7350ac3d2a107c0d849968eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107429.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bronchiolitis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute bronchiolitis","infants","recurrent wheezing","episode of bronchiolitis","urine metabolomic analysis","groups of children","urine samples","metabolomic profiling of urine specimens","Untargeted metabolomic analyses","increased risk","greater risk","postbronchiolitis recurrent wheeze","multivariate data analyses","Data modeling","Pathway overrepresentation analysis","preliminary prospective study","major involvement","University Hospital of Padova","emergency department","mass spectrometry","cysteine","citric acid cycle","univariate","year old","lysine","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","years","amino acids","available tools","methionine","differentiating","episodes of physician","Follow-up visits","METHODS","condition","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, in 2014, human coronavirus (HCoV) caused not only upper respiratory infections but also LRTIs more commonly than in other years. Therefore, we sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and severity of illnesses associated with HCoV infections at a single center in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV respiratory specimens between October 2014 and December 2014 who were admitted to Severance Children\u2019s Hospital at Yonsei University Medical Center for LRTI. Charts of the patients with HCoV infection were reviewed and compared with RSV infection. RESULTS: During the study period, HCoV was the third most common respiratory virus and accounted for 13.7% of infections. Coinfection was detected in 43.8% of children with HCoV. Interestingly, one patient had both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. Mild pneumonia was most common (60.4%) with HCoV, and when combined with RSV, resulted in bronchiolitis. Two patients required care in the intensive care unit. However, compared with that of RSV infection, the disease course HCoV was short. CONCLUSION: Infections caused by HCoVs are common, and can cause LRTIs. During an epidemic season, clinicians should be given special consideration thereto. When combined with other medical conditions, such as neurologic or cardiologic diseases, intensive care unit (ICU) care may be necessary.","publish_time":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Kyu Yeun; Han, Song Yi; Kim, Ho-Seong; Cheong, Hyang-Min; Kim, Sung Soon; Kim, Dong Soo","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2011e171a1664541e88ec5333849781130565135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5122634.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2017.58.1.174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27873511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Korea","Republic"],"keyphrases":["HCoV infections","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-NL63","positive HCoV respiratory specimens","disease course HCoV","upper respiratory infections","common respiratory virus","RSV infection","lower respiratory tract infections","patients","LRTIs","intensive care unit","respiratory syncytial virus","common pathogen","Yonsei University Medical Center","single center","medical conditions","Republic of Korea","winter season","epidemic season","cardiologic diseases","ICU","Severance Children\u2019s Hospital","outcomes","severity of illnesses","clinical characteristics","clinicians","late autumn","epidemiology","study period","HCoVs","Charts","special consideration","RESULTS","PURPOSE","METHODS","Mild pneumonia","CONCLUSION","human coronavirus","MATERIALS","years","bronchiolitis","Coinfection"],"language":"en"},

The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manczinger, M\u00E1t\u00E9; Boross, G\u00E1bor; Kem\u00E9ny, Lajos; M\u00FCller, Viktor; Lenz, Tobias L.; Papp, Bal\u00E1zs; P\u00E1l, Csaba","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e9a78b8f365405455eb60c2645de7bd7359e7a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6372212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["promiscuous MHC molecules","promiscuous MHC class","Certain MHC molecules","immune response","promiscuity level of MHC class","geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level","adaptive immune system","generalist adaptive immune recognition","pathogen load","human genome","pathogen diversity","human evolution","human populations","pathogen-rich geographical regions","broader range of pathogens","infectious diseases","neuropsychiatric diseases","disease associations","generalist antigen presentation","corresponding genomic region","wider range of epitopes","implications","autoimmune disorders","cancers","groups of proteins","humans","tolerance","elevated epitope-binding repertoire","medical genetics","major histocompatibility complex","switch","specialist","positive selection","Central players","DRB1 alleles","peptide segments","functional implication","self-peptides","molecular positions","epidemiology","rapid manner","work","lines of evidence","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, genome replication of enteroviruses occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles (ROs). Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03B2 (PI4KB) is required by all enteroviruses for RO formation. The enteroviral 3A protein recruits PI4KB to ROs, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) in PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication using ACBD3 knockout (ACBD3(KO)) cells. ACBD3 knockout impaired replication of representative viruses from four enterovirus species and two rhinovirus species. PI4KB recruitment was not observed in the absence of ACBD3. The lack of ACBD3 also affected the localization of individually expressed 3A, causing 3A to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the Golgi. Reconstitution of wild-type (wt) ACBD3 restored PI4KB recruitment and 3A localization, while an ACBD3 mutant that cannot bind to PI4KB restored 3A localization, but not virus replication. Consistently, reconstitution of a PI4KB mutant that cannot bind ACBD3 failed to restore virus replication in PI4KB(KO) cells. Finally, by reconstituting ACBD3 mutants lacking specific domains in ACBD3(KO) cells, we show that acyl-coenzyme A binding (ACB) and charged-amino-acid region (CAR) domains are dispensable for 3A-mediated PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication.

There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and R(t) exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination.

Surprisingly, little is known about antibiotic use in children as compared to adults with RTI. This prospective study aimed to determine antibiotic misuse in children and adults with RTI, using an expert panel reference standard, in order to prioritise the target age population for antibiotic stewardship interventions. We recruited children and adults who presented at the emergency department or were hospitalised with clinical presentation of RTI in The Netherlands and Israel. A panel of three experienced physicians adjudicated a reference standard diagnosis (i.e. bacterial or viral infection) for all the patients using all available clinical and laboratory information, including a 28-day follow-up assessment. The cohort included 284 children and 232 adults with RTI (median age, 1.3 years and 64.5 years, respectively). The proportion of viral infections was larger in children than in adults (209(74%) versus 89(38%), p \u003C 0.001). In case of viral RTI, antibiotics were prescribed (i.e. overuse) less frequently in children than in adults (77/209 (37%) versus 74/89 (83%), p \u003C 0.001). One (1%) child and three (2%) adults with bacterial infection were not treated with antibiotics (i.e. underuse); all were mild cases. This international, prospective study confirms major antibiotic overuse in patients with RTI. Viral infection is more common in children, but antibiotic overuse is more frequent in adults with viral RTI. Together, these findings support the need for effective interventions to decrease antibiotic overuse in RTI patients of all ages.

During infection, their genomes are carried in capsids across the membranes of host cells to sites of virion production by exploiting cellular behaviour and resources to guide and achieve all aspects of delivery and the downstream virus manufacturing process. Successful entry hinges on execution of a precisely tuned viral uncoating program where incoming capsids disassemble in consecutive steps to ensure that genomes are released at the right time, and in the right place for replication to occur. Each step of disassembly is cell-assisted, involving individual pathways that transmit signals to regulate discrete functions, but at the same time, these signalling pathways are organized into larger networks, which communicate back and forth in complex ways in response to the presence of virus. In this review, we consider the elegant strategy by which adenoviruses (AdVs) target and navigate cellular networks to initiate the production of progeny virions. There are many remarkable aspects about the AdV entry program; for example, the virus gains targeted control of a large well-defined local network neighbourhood by coupling several interacting processes (including endocytosis, autophagy and microtubule trafficking) around a collective reference state centred on the interactional topology and multifunctional nature of protein VI. Understanding the network targeting activity of protein VI, as well as other built-in mechanisms that allow AdV particles to be efficient at navigating the subsystems of the cell, can be used to improve viral vectors, but also has potential to be incorporated for use in entirely novel delivery systems.","publish_time":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flatt, Justin W.; Butcher, Sarah J.","journal":"Open Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba5bd045c1bf42ba77162118e5150b2e2b415268.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ed4d4c0c8e8a99060cb7347585bbbeff3c823193.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6395880.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395880/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AdV entry program","cellular networks","presence of virus","aspects of delivery","right time","genomes","network targeting activity of protein VI","incoming capsids","tuned viral uncoating program","multifunctional nature of protein VI","AdV particles","cellular behaviour","downstream virus manufacturing process","signalling pathways","remarkable aspects","individual pathways","larger networks","viral vectors","right place","sites of virion production","production of progeny virions","Successful entry hinges","novel delivery systems","large well-defined local network neighbourhood","interactional topology","targeted control","AdVs","execution","example","microtubule trafficking","interacting processes","collective reference state","membranes of host cells","endocytosis","autophagy","obligatory parasites","consecutive steps","elegant strategy","advantage of intracellular niches","adenoviruses","signals","response","resources","built-in mechanisms","complex ways","potential","discrete functions","review","step of disassembly","subsystems","replication","infection"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to describe the use of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) as a clinical tool in a tertiary Paediatric Intensive Care unit.

This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. METHOD: Using a retrospective population-based cohort study linking ED records to birth and perinatal records, we examined presentation rates for metropolitan, rural and remote Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from 469 589 births. We used ED diagnosis information to categorise presentations into ARI groups and calculated age-specific rates. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate association between risk factors and frequency of ARI presentation. RESULTS: Overall, 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged \u003C12 months in the Great Southern (1233 per 1000 child-years) and Pilbara regions (1088 per 1000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children \u003C12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1000 child-years, respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups \u003C5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, caesarean delivery and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas. CONCLUSION: One in four ED presentations in WA children are for ARIs, representing a significant out-of-hospital burden with some evidence of geographical disparity. Planned linkages with hospital discharge and laboratory detection data will aid in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of ARI diagnoses in ED.","publish_time":"2019-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnes, Rosanne; Blyth, Christopher C; de Klerk, Nicholas; Lee, Wei Hao; Borland, Meredith L; Richmond, Peter; Lim, Faye J; Fathima, Parveen; Moore, Hannah C","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fab9d6fcfd7daca9ed2e0f89c2433955d34e553.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8d732d6fc180c5be5a7c49cd8d8cf49332d24b39.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8d612e0c4433db428f3e06657888d5296a43b653.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Western Australian","ED","ARI"],"locations":["Southwest","Kimberley"],"keyphrases":["non-Aboriginal children","WA children","presentation rates","ARI groups","ED presentations","highest rates","child-years","ED records","frequency of ARI presentation","remote WA","burden of ARIs","remote areas","specificity of ARI diagnoses","calculated age-specific rates","hospital burden","ED diagnosis information","age groups","risk factors","months","EDs","perinatal records","hospital discharge","Kimberley region","lower socio-economic areas","retrospective population-based cohort study","residence","acute respiratory infections","caesarean delivery","laboratory detection data","association","Studies","prematurity","male","Planned linkages","emergency department","INTRODUCTION","sensitivity","Pilbara regions","time","evidence of geographical disparity","Southwest","births","Negative binomial regression","METHOD","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for diagnoses, clinical course, chest X-ray findings, laboratory data, and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: All nine patients were misdiagnosed at the outpatient department between 07/2009 and 07/2017. They were diagnosed with septicemia and hemophagocytic syndrome, sepsis and hemophagocytic syndrome, severe infection, hepatitis and hemophagocytic syndrome, or upper respiratory tract infection. Among the nine patients, hepatic function examination showed decreased albumin and elevated C-reactive protein levels in all patients; alanine aminotransferase was increased and platelets were decreased in eight patients. Weil-Felix reaction was positive in three of nine patients. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated positive IgM antibody and EB virus-IgM in all nine patients; Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody was positive in seven patients. All nine patients underwent chest computed tomography; no abnormality was found in two patients. Patch shadow with increased density was found in seven patients, including four patients with right pleural effusion and two with bilateral pleural effusion. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in all nine patients and hemophagocytic cells were seen. The nine misdiagnosed cases were given multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics either successively or concomitantly before and after admission, but no effective antibiotics against Orientis tsutsugamushi were applied. After diagnosis was corrected to scrub typhus, five patients were switched to chloramphenicol and dexamethasone, two patients were given azithromycin and dexamethasone, and two patients were treated with chloramphenicol. Body temperature returned to normal within 2\u20133 days and the children were quickly relieved from their condition. CONCLUSION: Hemophagocytic syndrome may be the presenting clinical feature of scrub typhus and initially mask the disease. Initial misdiagnosis is common and includes septicemia and hemophagocytic syndrome. The eschar is a useful diagnostic clue and febrile patients without any localizing signs should be thoroughly examined for its presence.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Miaomiao; Huang, Airong; Zheng, Xiang; Ge, Lisha; He, Shijun","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50b6a6d5ea21f3e1b1d2872bcdab95e3646ed400.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6458710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EB","Orientis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["febrile patients","hemophagocytic syndrome","hemophagocytic cells","cases of clinical misdiagnosis of scrub typhus","positive IgM antibody","presenting clinical feature of scrub typhus","clinical course","septicemia","dexamethasone","misdiagnosed cases","chloramphenicol","bilateral pleural effusion","severe infection","decreased albumin","effective antibiotics","Initial misdiagnosis","increased density","chest X-ray findings","EB virus-IgM","Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody","chest computed tomography","multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics","upper respiratory tract infection","elevated C-reactive protein levels","hepatitis","sepsis","laboratory data","diagnoses","hepatic function examination","useful diagnostic clue","medical records","alanine aminotransferase","Indirect immunofluorescence","abnormality","azithromycin","antibiotic therapy","localizing signs","eschar","Patch shadow","Orientis tsutsugamushi","Weil-Felix reaction","platelets","Bone marrow biopsy","children","days","Body temperature","study","admission","outpatient department","disease","CONCLUSION","condition","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","presence"],"language":"en"},

Some strains can be transmitted to other hosts, including chickens, and cause respiratory and systemic disease. Rarely, these highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause disease in mallards, while chickens are highly susceptible. The long co-evolution of mallard ducks with influenza viruses has undoubtedly fine-tuned many immunological host\u2013pathogen interactions to confer resistance to disease, which are poorly understood. Here, we compare innate responses to different avian influenza viruses in ducks and chickens to reveal differences that point to potential mechanisms of disease resistance. Mallard ducks are permissive to LPAI replication in their intestinal tissues without overtly compromising their fitness. In contrast, the mallard response to HPAI infection reflects an immediate and robust induction of type I interferon and antiviral interferon stimulated genes, highlighting the importance of the RIG-I pathway. Ducks also appear to limit the duration of the response, particularly of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Chickens lack RIG-I, and some modulators of the signaling pathway and may be compromised in initiating an early interferon response, allowing more viral replication and consequent damage. We review current knowledge about innate response mediators to influenza infection in mallard ducks compared to chickens to gain insight into protective immune responses, and open questions for future research.","publish_time":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evseev, Danyel; Magor, Katharine E.","journal":"Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/169ca2aef2c810471d33aa6522aa25a70594ae26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mallard response","influenza infection","different avian influenza viruses","long co-evolution of mallard ducks","early interferon response","Chickens lack RIG","systemic disease","innate response mediators","important natural hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza","HPAI infection","LPAI replication","innate responses","potential mechanisms of disease resistance","strains","pathway","antiviral interferon stimulated genes","viral replication","protective immune responses","robust induction of type","open questions","pathogen interactions","importance","immunological host","insight","mallards","intestinal tissues","current knowledge","differences","pro-inflammatory cytokine expression","future research","reservoir","consequent damage","contrast","little harm","fitness","modulators","duration"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, in both virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations, we demonstrate a set of core exacerbation modules, among which epithelial-associated SMAD3 signaling is upregulated and lymphocyte response pathways are downregulated early in exacerbation, followed by later upregulation of effector pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, extracellular matrix production, mucus hypersecretion, and eosinophil activation. We show an additional set of multiple inflammatory cell pathways involved in virus-associated exacerbations, in contrast to squamous cell pathways associated with nonviral exacerbations.

In Europe, members of the genus Culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls. Culex pipiens L., the common house mosquito, exists in two physically very similar, yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes (or forms, \u2018f.\u2019), namely Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats. The epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in Eastern Austria, but the hypogean distribution of the Cx. pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as Cx. torrentium is unknown. Considering the key role of Culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens, the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate. For a first pertinent investigation in Austria, we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states. Based on analyses of the ACE2 gene and the CQ11 microsatellite locus, 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus Culex, two females of the genus Culiseta and a single female of the genus Anopheles were determined to species level or below. In our catches, Cx. pipiens f. pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted Cx. pipiens f. molestus many times over. Records of Cx. hortensis and Cx. territans, two species rarely collected in Austria, lead us to infer that underground habitats host a higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes than previously thought.","publish_time":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zittra, Carina; Moog, Otto; Christian, Erhard; Fuehrer, Hans-Peter","journal":"Parasitol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0a39e0aaa5566362f32ead0b27cf6a840b271ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6478630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Eastern Austria","Austria"],"keyphrases":["adapted Cx","Records of Cx","genus Culex","male mosquitoes","key role of Culex mosquitoes","genus Anopheles","genus Culiseta","Eastern Austria","species composition","subterranean shelters","higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes","species level","underground habitats","molestus","relative abundance","single female","hibernation shelters","Subterranean cavities","apparent abundance","distinct biotypes","similar non-members","cave walls","eastern federal states","general paucity of data","epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens","resting places","CQ11 microsatellite locus","ACE2 gene","abundant insects","hypogean distribution","females","adaptations","hybrids","Europe","common house mosquito","pertinent investigation","Autogeny","analyses","epigean occurrence","forms","torrentium","times","territans","catches","hortensis"],"language":"en"},

Antibiotics are losing their effectiveness due to the emerging infectious diseases, the scarcity of novel antibiotics, and the contributions of antibiotic misuse and overuse to resistance. Characterization of the lipidomic response to pneumonia and exploring the \u201Clipidomic phenotype\u201D can provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments. METHODS: Lipid profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were generated through untargeted lipidomic profiling analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify possible sources of variations among samples. Partitioning clustering analysis (k-means) was employed to evaluate the existence of distinct lipidomic clusters. RESULTS: PCA showed that BALF lipidomes differed significantly between CAP (n = 52) and controls (n = 68, including 35 healthy volunteers and 33 patients with non-infectious lung diseases); while no clear separation was found between severe CAP and non-severe CAP cases. Lactosylceramides were the most prominently elevated lipid constituent in CAP. Clustering analysis revealed three separate lipid profiles; subjects in each cluster exhibited significant differences in disease severity, incidence of hypoxemia, percentages of phagocytes in BALF, and serum concentrations of albumin and total cholesterol (all p \u003C 0.05). In addition, SM (d34:1) was negatively related to macrophage (adjusted r = \u2212 0.462, p \u003C 0.0001) and PE (18:1p/20:4) was positively correlated with polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentages of BALF (adjusted r = 0.541, p \u003C 0.0001). The 30-day mortality did not differ amongst three clusters (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific lower airway lipid composition is related to different intensities of host inflammatory responses, and may contribute to functionally relevant shifts in disease pathogenesis in CAP individuals. These findings argue for the need to tailor therapy based on specific lipid profiles and related inflammatory status. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03093220).

CLD granules have been used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and feverish diseases in China, including seasonal influenza, but few evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy and safety in the treatment of influenza. Here, we performed an EBM clinical trial combining Western Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) evaluation systems to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, double-simulation, oseltamivir-controlled and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. Eligible subjects (n=318) will be allocated after satisfying the criteria (Western medicine). Subjects will be randomised to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with follow-up after treatment to record symptoms and signs and to collect pharyngeal/throat swabs and serum samples for detecting the virus and antibodies. At the same time, the syndrome differentiation criteria of TCM, such as tongue body, furred tongue and type of pulse, will be recorded as determined by doctors of both Western and Chinese medicine. Participants will be instructed to comply with the protocol and to keep a daily record of symptoms. The primary and secondary outcomes and safety indicators will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza based on both Western Chinese medicine and TCM evaluation systems.

Also, plant pathogen genomes are starting to be used to investigate plant disease epidemics such as the wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh. While these genome-based approaches provide never-seen advantages over all previous approaches with regard to public health and biosecurity, they also come with new vulnerabilities and risks with regard to cybersecurity. The more we rely on genome databases, the more likely these databases will become targets for cyber-attacks to interfere with public health and biosecurity systems by compromising their integrity, taking them hostage, or manipulating the data they contain. Also, while there is the potential to collect pathogen genomic data from infected individuals or agricultural and food products during disease outbreaks to improve disease modeling and forecast, how to protect the privacy of individuals, growers, and retailers is another major cyberbiosecurity challenge. As data become linkable to other data sources, individuals and groups become identifiable and potential malicious activities targeting those identified become feasible.

There are few published studies examining diarrhea in children aged \u003C5 years in Iraq. This study aims to investigate the occurrences and epidemiology of selected bacterial (Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.), viral (adenovirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus), and parasitic (Entamoeba spp. and Giardia spp.) agents in stool samples from 155 child diarrheal cases enrolled between March and August 2017, in a hospital-based cross-sectional study in Thi-Qar, southeastern Iraq. Using molecular techniques and sequence-based characterization, adenovirus was the most frequently detected enteropathogen (53/155 (34.2%)), followed by Salmonella spp. (23/155 (14.8%)), Entamoeba spp. (21/155 (13.5%)), and Campylobacter spp. (17/155 (10.9%)). Mixed infection with Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was evident, and the same was revealed between various enteric viruses, particularly adenovirus and norovirus. The most frequent co-infection pattern was between adenovirus and Campylobacter spp., in seven cases (7/155 (4.5%)). Whole-genome sequencing-derived typing data for Salmonella isolates (n = 23) revealed that sequence type 49 was the most prevalent in this sample set (15/23 (65.2%)). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report on detection and identification of floR, bla(CARB-2), and mphA antimicrobial resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from children in the Middle East region. Logistic regression analysis pointed to few enteropathogen-specific correlations between child age, household water source, and breastfeeding patterns in relation to the outcome of detection of individual enteropathogens. This study presents the first published molecular investigation of multiple enteropathogens among children \u003C5 years of age in Iraq. Our data provide supporting evidence for planning of childhood diarrhea management programs.

Although both components are deemed necessary for recovery, the balance is tight and easily lost. Losing the balance can lead to life-threatening infectious complications as well as long-term immunosuppression with recurrent infections. Neutrophils are known to play a key role in these processes. Therefore, this review focuses on neutrophil characteristics and function after trauma and how these features can be used to identify trauma patients at risk for infectious complications. RESULTS: Distinct neutrophil subtypes exist that play their own role in the recovery and/or development of infectious complications after trauma. Furthermore, the refractory immune state is related to the risk of infectious complications. These findings change the initial concepts of the immune response after trauma and give rise to new biomarkers for monitoring and predicting inflammatory complications in severely injured patients. CONCLUSION: For early recognition of patients at risk, the immune system should be monitored. Several neutrophil biomarkers show promising results and analysis of these markers has become accessible to such extent that they can be used for point-of-care decision making after trauma.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hesselink, Lillian; Spijkerman, Roy; van Wessem, Karlijn J.

This distinction is based on high expression of proteins and good immunogenicity despite an inability to assemble infectious progeny in human cells, which together promote efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, the basis for the host-range restriction is unknown despite past systematic attempts to identify the relevant missing viral gene(s). The search for host-range factors is exacerbated by the large number of deletions, truncations and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in chicken embryo fibroblasts. By whole genome sequencing of a panel of recombinant host-range extended (HRE) MVAs generated by marker rescue with 40 kbp segments of vaccinia virus DNA, we identified serine protease inhibitor 1 (SPI-1) as one of several candidate host-range factors present in those viruses that gained the ability to replicate in human cells. Electron microscopy revealed that the interruption of morphogenesis in human cells infected with MVA occurred at a similar stage as that of a vaccinia virus strain WR SPI-1 deletion mutant. Moreover, the introduction of the SPI-1 gene into the MVA genome led to more than a 2-log enhancement of virus spread in human diploid MRC-5 cells, whereas deletion of the gene diminished the spread of HRE viruses by similar extents. Furthermore, MRC-5 cells stably expressing SPI-1 also enhanced replication of MVA. A role for additional host range genes was suggested by the restoration of MVA replication to a lower level relative to HRE viruses, particularly in other human cell lines. Although multiple sequence alignments revealed genetic changes in addition to SPI-1 common to the HRE MVAs, no evidence for their host-range function was found by analysis thus far. Our finding that SPI-1 is host range factor for MVA should simplify use of high throughput RNAi or CRISPR/Cas single gene methods to identify additional viral and human restriction elements.","publish_time":"2019-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ruikang; Mendez-Rios, Jorge D.; Peng, Chen; Xiao, Wei; Weisberg, Andrea S.; Wyatt, Linda S.; Moss, Bernard","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e58bb3ad5e35a2895353e82c3690e2dd33a8d86b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6542542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6542542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVA","CRISPR/Cas"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["human cells","host-range restriction","host-range function","replication of MVA","MVA genome","additional host range genes","candidate host-range factors","panel of recombinant host-range","restoration of MVA replication","vaccinia virus strain WR SPI","HRE MVAs","human restriction elements","spread of HRE viruses","human diploid MRC","human cell lines","long passage history of MVA","Modified vaccinia virus Ankara","kbp segments of vaccinia virus DNA","relevant missing viral gene","log enhancement of virus","Cas single gene methods","infectious progeny","deletion mutant","unknown despite","similar extents","similar stage","genome sequencing","high expression of proteins","diverse infectious diseases","use of high throughput RNAi","CRISPR","development of vaccines","systematic attempts","lower level relative","genetic changes","inability","leading poxvirus vector","good immunogenicity","marker rescue","mutations","chicken embryo fibroblasts","serine protease inhibitor","interruption of morphogenesis","multiple sequence alignments","evidence","large number of deletions","truncations","role","efficacy","search","basis","Electron microscopy","distinction","analysis","introduction","safety","finding"],"language":"en"},

It has been determined that CPK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count (RBC), and concentration of total serum protein (TSP) slightly increased after training sessions and competitions in similar manner. The increase in white blood cell (WBC) count was higher after competitions and SAA increased only after competitions. Total protein concentration was the only parameter that increased with training during a 7-month program. SAA indicated only in the case of heavy effort, and, it thus may be helpful in the monitoring of training in young horses. In an optimal program, its concentration should not increase after a training session but only after heavy effort, which should not be repeated too often.","publish_time":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Witkowska-Pi\u0142aszewicz, Olga; B\u0105ska, Piotr; Czopowicz, Micha\u0142; \u017Bmigrodzka, Magdalena; Szczepaniak, Jaros\u0142aw; Szarska, Ewa; Winnicka, Anna; Cywi\u0144ska, Anna","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39cf0b0febc53a4655489e3e458a93585b68093d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6616404.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endurance training","training sessions","monitoring of training","measured blood parameters","blood testing","white blood cell","basic blood parameters","red blood cell count","Sport training leads","competitions","changes","SAA","Total protein concentration","hemoglobin concentration","concentration of total serum protein","young horses","CPK","physical effort","Arabian horses","case of heavy effort","increase","packed cell volume","serum amyloid","optimal program","month program","equine endurance athletes","WBC","AST","PCV","TSP","RBC","creatine phosphokinase activity","exercise","adaptation","aspartate aminotransferase","similar manner","events","longitudinal investigation","months","support","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition, many of these compounds show interesting biological properties such as anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. Garcinia parvifolia is used in traditional medicine. Currently, the antiviral activity of G. parvifolia is not known. METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the effects of ethyl acetate (45 L Ea), ethanol (45 L Et), and hexane (45 L H) leaf extracts of G. parvifolia on the infectivity of pseudorabies virus (PrV) in Vero cells. The antiviral effects of the extracts were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE), inhibition, attachment, and virucidal assays. RESULTS: The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) values obtained were 237.5, 555.0, and \u003C 1.25 \u03BCg/mL for 45 L Ea, 45 L Et, and 45 L H, respectively. The 45 L Ea showed the greatest viral inhibition potency of 75% at 125 \u03BCg/mL. Both 45 L Ea and 45 l Et caused 100% residual viral inhibition at 250 \u03BCg/mL. The selectivity index values for 45 L Ea, 45 L Et, and 45 L H were 2.65, 1.75, and 0.10 showing that 45 L Ea had the greatest antiviral activity among the three extracts. CONCLUSION: This study showed that ethyl acetate is the best solvent to be used to obtain extract from G. parvifolia leaves with potent antiviral activities.","publish_time":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adnan, Aziera; Allaudin, Zeenathul Nazariah; Hani, Homayoun; Loh, Hwei-San; Khoo, Teng-Jin; Ting, Kang Nee; Abdullah, Rasedee","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6b5bfea0defb38a81a9c9dd23b4d0f272ac05da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6617885.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of","Garcinia parvifolia","greatest antiviral activity","antiviral effects","\u03BCg","parvifolia leaves","potent antiviral activities","greatest viral inhibition potency","residual viral inhibition","leaf extracts of","effects of ethyl acetate","study","anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity","bioactive compounds","Garcinia species","antioxidant activities","infectivity of pseudorabies virus","selectivity index values","interesting biological properties","benzophenones","antifungal","anti-inflammatory","PrV","xanthones","flavonoids","triterpernoids","attachment","CPE","BACKGROUND","cytopathic effect","Vero cells","best solvent","cytotoxicity concentration","CC","virucidal assays","traditional medicine","hexane","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","ethanol","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

Despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as receptors. The highly homologous subgroup A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) glycoproteins belong to the group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that allows experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process. We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus.

With low cost whole genome sequencing technology and powerful computing capabilities, novel computational approaches have demonstrated the potential to facilitate the design of a universal influenza vaccine. However, few studies have integrated computational optimization in the design and discovery of new vaccines. Understanding the potential of computational vaccine design is necessary before these approaches can be implemented on a broad scale. This review summarizes some promising computational approaches under current development, including computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens with consensus sequences, phylogenetic model-based ancestral sequence reconstruction, and immunomics to compute conserved cross-reactive T-cell epitopes. Interactions between virus-host-environment determine the evolvability of the influenza population. We propose that with the development of novel technologies that allow the integration of data sources such as protein structural modeling, host antibody repertoire analysis and advanced phylodynamic modeling, computational approaches will be crucial for the development of a long-lasting universal influenza vaccine. Taken together, computational approaches are powerful and promising tools for the development of a universal influenza vaccine with durable and broad protection.","publish_time":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Xueting; Duvvuri, Venkata R.; Bahl, Justin","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ee05def9e9c177e9c22bf4ef9bfcca045572916.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631137.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel computational approaches","promising computational approaches","potential of computational vaccine design","computational optimization","long-lasting universal influenza vaccine","influenza population","current development","broad protection","development of novel technologies","virus-host","traditional design of effective vaccines","long-lasting protection","broad spectrum","broad scale","promising tools","protein structural modeling","advanced phylodynamic modeling","powerful computing capabilities","discovery of new vaccines","host antibody repertoire analysis","phylogenetic model","genome sequencing technology","immunomics","ancestral sequence reconstruction","consensus sequences","integration of data sources","reactive antigens","environment","conserved cross-reactive T-cell epitopes","low cost","evolving pathogens","evolvability","Interactions","review","studies"],"language":"en"},

The Wellcome Trust-Vietnamese Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (WT-VIZIONS) is aiming to understand the circulation of viral zoonotic pathogens in animals that pose a potential risk to human health. Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure. We found a high prevalence of HEV GT3 viral RNA in pigs (19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs) and a high HEV seroprevalence in pig farmers (16.0%) and a hospital-attending population (31.7%) in southern Vietnam. The hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias. The detection of HEV RNA in pigs indicates that HEV may be a zoonotic disease risk in this location, although a larger sample size is required to infer an association between HEV positivity in pigs and seroprevalence in humans.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berto, A.; Pham, H.

Here, we describe a cell-based assay for monitoring EV release using the EV-enriched tetraspanin CD63 fused to the small, ATP-independent reporter enzyme, Nanoluciferase. Release of CD63-containing EVs from stably expressing cell lines was monitored by comparing luciferase activity in culture media to that remaining in cells. HEK293, U2OS, U87 and SKMel28 cells released 0.3%-0.6% of total cellular CD63 in the form of EVs over 5 hrs, varying by cell line. To identify cellular machinery important for secretion of CD63-containing EVs, we performed a screen of biologically active chemicals in HEK293 cells. While a majority of compounds did not significantly affect EV release, treating cells with the plecomacrolides bafilomycin or concanamycin, known to inhibit the V-ATPase, dramatically increased EV release. Interestingly, alkalization of the endosomal lumen using weak bases had no effect, suggesting a pH-independent enhancement of EV release by V-ATPase inhibitors.

This \u22122/\u22121 PRF mechanism is transactivated by a viral protein, nsp1\u03B2, and cellular poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBPs). Critical elements for \u22122/\u22121 PRF, including a slippery sequence and a downstream C-rich motif, were also identified in 11 simarteriviruses. However, the slippery sequences (XXXUCUCU instead of XXXUUUUU) in seven simarteriviruses can only facilitate \u22122 PRF to generate nsp2TF. The nsp1\u03B2 of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) was identified as a key factor that transactivates both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF, and the universally conserved Tyr111 and Arg114 in nsp1\u03B2 are essential for this activity. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated the involvement of PCBPs in simarterivirus \u22122/\u22121 PRF. Using SHFV reverse genetics, we confirmed critical roles of nsp1\u03B2, slippery sequence, and C-rich motif in \u22122/\u22121 PRF in SHFV-infected cells. Attenuated virus growth ability was observed in SHFV mutants with impaired expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. Comparative genomic sequence analysis showed that key elements of \u22122/\u22121 PRF are highly conserved in all known arteriviruses except equine arteritis virus (EAV) and wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV). Furthermore, \u22122/\u22121 PRF with SHFV PRF signal RNA can be stimulated by heterotypic nsp1\u03B2s of all non-EAV arteriviruses tested. Taken together, these data suggest that \u22122/\u22121 PRF is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism employed in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins that are important for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Simarteriviruses are a group of arteriviruses infecting nonhuman primates, and a number of new species have been established in recent years. Although these arteriviruses are widely distributed among African nonhuman primates of different species, and some of them cause lethal hemorrhagic fever disease, this group of viruses has been undercharacterized. Since wild nonhuman primates are historically important sources or reservoirs of human pathogens, there is concern that simarteriviruses may be preemergent zoonotic pathogens. Thus, molecular characterization of simarteriviruses is becoming a priority in arterivirology. In this study, we demonstrated that an evolutionarily conserved ribosomal frameshifting mechanism is used by simarteriviruses and other distantly related arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins. This mechanism is unprecedented in eukaryotic systems. Given the crucial role of ribosome function in all living systems, the potential impact of the in-depth characterization of this novel mechanism reaches beyond the field of virology.","publish_time":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yanhua; Firth, Andrew E.; Brierley, Ian; Cai, Yingyun; Napthine, Sawsan; Wang, Tao; Yan, Xingyu; Kuhn, Jens H.; Fang, Ying","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/870c8d63bfe7cbede0c0779b7991b8296dfede1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6675879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRF mechanism","conserved mechanism","SHFV PRF signal RNA","WPDV arteriviruses","expression of additional viral proteins","non-EAV arteriviruses","known arteriviruses","related arteriviruses","novel mechanism","IMPORTANCE Simarteriviruses","ribosomal frameshifting mechanism","group of arteriviruses infecting nonhuman primates","SHFV mutants","viral replication","molecular characterization of simarteriviruses","nsp1\u03B2 of simian hemorrhagic fever virus","binding proteins","conserved Tyr111","respiratory syndrome virus","equine arteritis virus","wild nonhuman primates","critical roles of nsp1\u03B2","SHFV reverse genetics","impaired expression of nsp2TF","SHFV-infected cells","wobbly possum disease virus","Attenuated virus growth ability","African nonhuman primates of different species","slippery sequences","key elements","Critical elements","nsp2N","lethal hemorrhagic fever disease","downstream C-rich motif","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","important sources","nonstructural protein","Comparative genomic sequence analysis","living systems","group of viruses","in-depth characterization","involvement of PCBPs","eukaryotic systems","key factor","translation experiments","zoonotic pathogens","number of new species","reservoirs of human pathogens","cellular poly","heterotypic nsp1\u03B2s","potential impact","PRRSV","crucial role of ribosome function","Arg114","XXXUUUUU","XXXUCUCU","priority","recent years","field of virology","transactivates","activity","arterivirology","data","study"],"language":"en"},

In fact, man-specific seaweed lectins consist of different structural scaffolds harboring a single or a few carbohydrate-binding sites which specifically recognize mannose-containing glycans. Depending on the structural scaffold, man-specific seaweed lectins belong to five distinct structurally-related lectin families, namely (1) the griffithsin lectin family (\u03B2-prism I scaffold); (2) the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin homolog (OAAH) lectin family (\u03B2-barrel scaffold); (3) the legume lectin-like lectin family (\u03B2-sandwich scaffold); (4) the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA)-like lectin family (\u03B2-prism II scaffold); and, (5) the MFP2-like lectin family (MFP2-like scaffold). Another algal lectin from Ulva pertusa, has been inferred to the methanol dehydrogenase related lectin family, because it displays a rather different GlcNAc-specificity. In spite of these structural discrepancies, all members from the five lectin families share a common ability to specifically recognize man-containing glycans and, especially, high-mannose type glycans. Because of their mannose-binding specificity, these lectins have been used as valuable tools for deciphering and characterizing the complex mannose-containing glycans from the glycocalyx covering both normal and transformed cells, and as diagnostic tools and therapeutic drugs that specifically recognize the altered high-mannose N-glycans occurring at the surface of various cancer cells. In addition to these anti-cancer properties, man-specific seaweed lectins have been widely used as potent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-inactivating proteins, due to their capacity to specifically interact with the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and prevent the virion infectivity of HIV-1 towards the host CD4\u002B T-lymphocyte cells in vitro.","publish_time":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barre, Annick; Simplicien, Mathias; Benoist, Herv\u00E9; Van Damme, Els J.M.; Roug\u00E9, Pierre","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d710e993d5c0aca81ed537d9462953a234309a1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723950.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["griffithsin lectin family","algal lectin","legume lectin","related lectin families","specific lectins","man-specific seaweed lectins","methanol dehydrogenase related lectin family","\u03B2-barrel scaffold","\u03B2-sandwich scaffold","complex mannose","number of mannose","high-mannose type glycans","mannose-binding specificity","\u03B2-prism","altered high-mannose N-glycans","different structural scaffolds","structural discrepancies","MFP2","surface of various cancer cells","T-lymphocyte cells","different GlcNAc-specificity","diagnostic tools","valuable tools","anti-cancer properties","virion infectivity of HIV","Galanthus nivalis agglutinin","carbohydrate-binding sites","Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin homolog","OAAH","host CD4","GNA","therapeutic drugs","potent human immunodeficiency virus","envelope glycoprotein gp120","deciphering","members","common ability","glycocalyx","fact","capacity","inactivating proteins","addition","Ulva pertusa","seaweeds","red algae","spite","date"],"language":"en"},

However, a number of intracellular pathogens colonize immune cells and the implication of Egr-1 in the host-pathogen interplay has remained elusive. Here, we have characterized the Egr-1 responses of primary murine and human dendritic cells (DCs) upon challenge with the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We report that live intracellular parasites induce a sustained high expression of Egr-1 in DCs, different from the immediate-early Egr-1 response to parasite lysates, inactivated parasites or LPS. Moreover, a distinct nuclear localization of elevated amounts of Egr-1 protein was detected in infected DCs, but not in by-stander DCs. The ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway mediated the canonical immediate-early Egr-1 response to soluble antigens in a MyD88/TLR-dependent fashion. In contrast, a non-canonical extended Egr-1 response that relied primarily on p38 MAPK signaling was induced by intracellular parasites and was exhibited similarly by MyD88-deficient and wildtype DCs. The extended phase Egr-1 response was dramatically reduced upon challenge of DCs with T. gondii parasites deficient in GRA24, a secreted p38-interacting protein. Further, Egr-1-silenced primary DCs maintained their migratory responses upon T. gondii challenge. Importantly, Egr-1 silencing led to elevated expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80) in Toxoplasma-infected DCs and in LPS-challenged immature DCs, indicating that Egr-1 responses suppressed maturation of DCs.

A higher proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to visit an outpatient clinic before the ER (P=0.003). Most patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult in case of illness. Most patients who visited the ER were single, \u003C 15 years, and had lower incomes. Patients requested ER services for primary care-treatable conditions because of limited services and resources as well as limited working hours at PHCCs. Most patients (90.0%) were knowledgeable about PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable. Patients reported long ER waiting times (\u2265 3 hours), no organization (85.9%), and lack of medical staff. Overall, overuse of ER services is high at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah. The risk factors for ER overuse are age \u003C 15 years, singlehood, and low incomes. Policy makers and health providers have a challenging task to control ER overuse.

Some of these viruses cause illness throughout the year, whereas others are most common in winter. All population groups experience these infections and illnesses. As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58\u201378% of infected patients, and 22\u201344% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented. A number of immune deficiencies in this patient population and options for control of these infections have been described that can, respectively, account for the medical problem and provide ways to approach prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"1997-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Couch, MD Robert B.; Englund, MD Janet A.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e71eb5bd4ccf675b2e597b29ce4c676e7fbd949.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124320.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000293439700003X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293439700003X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["M.D. Anderson Cancer Center","MDACC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","parainfluenza viruses","common infections","acute respiratory illnesses","virus infection","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory illness episodes","high frequencies of pneumonia","infection surveillance","cases of pneumonia","common type of acute illness","rhinoviruses","RSV","death","pure viral pneumonia","persistence of infection","MDACC","adenoviruses","infected patients","number of elderly persons","patient population","High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition","population groups","surveillance years","immunocompromised persons","number of immune deficiencies","leukemia","recent bone marrow transplant","hospitalized adults","options","awareness","underlying disease increases","ways","Anderson Cancer Center","control","descending order of frequency","medical problem","United States","prevention","coronaviruses","serious consequences","account","treatment","majority","role","prior reports","winter"],"language":"en"},

These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the \u201Cbag-of-words\u201D model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the \u201Cbag-of-words\u201D approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of \u201Cbag-of-words\u201D methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative \u2018degenerate\u2019 K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is discussed.

It is aimed at creating casualties, terror, societal disruption, or economic loss, inspired by ideological, religious or political beliefs. The success of bioterroristic attempts is defined by the measure of societal disruption and panic, and not necessarily by the sheer number of casualties. Thus, making only a few individuals ill by the use of crude methods may be sufficient, as long as it creates the impact that is aimed for. The assessment of bioterrorism threats and motives have been described before. Biocrime implies the use of a biological agent to kill or make ill a single individual or small group of individuals, motivated by revenge or the desire for monetary gain by extortion, rather than by political, ideological, religious or other beliefs. The likelihood of a successful bioterrorist attack is not very large, given the technical difficulties and constraints.

Apart from diarrhea it causes greasy skin exudation, dehydration, and distressed behavior and can ultimately lead to death. No specific causative agents have been identified and the syndrome is regarded as multifactorial. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible inflammatory state in mink kits with PWD, as indicated by raised serum concentrations of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) and by changes in intestinal pathomorphology and intestinal contents of bacteria. Samples collected from 20 diarrheic mink kits with PWD and 20 age-matched non-diarrheic control mink kits from two commercial Danish farms during the pre-weaning period (April\u2013May) in 2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: Concentrations of SAA in serum samples from mink kits with PWD were significantly higher (up to 1000-fold) compared to non-diarrheic control mink kits. Significant features of enterocytic vacuolization, atrophy and fusion of villi in jejunum and mucosal atrophy of the colon of kits with PWD were found. Moreover, attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes was more often found in kits suffering from PWD, while intra-cytoplasmic eosinophil bodies were more frequently observed in control kits. Cellular infiltrations with mononuclear and neutrophil leukocytes were not associated with disease status. Bacteria from the Staphylococcus intermedius group, such as Staphylococcus delphini, were more frequently cultivated from control mink kits, whereas Enterococcus spp. dominated in mink kits with PWD. Escherichia coli was cultivated from both control and mink kits with PWD, but with a higher frequency from mink kits with PWD. CONCLUSION: A significant increase in circulating concentrations of SAA was found in PWD affected mink kits from 6 to 23 days old compared to controls. The histopathological changes in PWD mink kits suggest that the type of diarrhea is secretory. Attachment of coccoid bacteria, therefore, might be responsible for an enterotoxic effect causing a loss of balance in movements of ions and water leading to the vacuolization and swelling of the enterocytes. The slight to moderate infiltrations of neutrophils irrespectively of diarrheic status and the attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes are comparable to observations found in piglets suffering from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhea Syndrome. Mechanisms behind the correlation between increased SAA levels and the observed pathological intestinal features remain obscure.","publish_time":"2018-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathiesen, Ronja; Birch, Julie Melsted; Chri\u00E9l, Mariann; Jensen, Henrik Elvang; Agger, Jens Frederik; Heegaard, Peter Mikael Helweg; Struve, Tina","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52ee7bd3f076b9f68b8fcea6687db4327d99cf71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6094914.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0403-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111375/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PWD","SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PWD mink kits","diarrheic mink kits","control kits","neonatal mink kits","colon of kits","age-matched non-diarrheic control mink kits","attachment of coccoid bacteria","serum concentrations","diarrheic status","intestinal contents of bacteria","enterocytes","circulating concentrations of SAA","Pre-weaning diarrhea","serum samples","type of diarrhea","New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhea Syndrome","increased SAA levels","intestinal pathomorphology","observed pathological intestinal features","Significant features of enterocytic vacuolization","pre-weaning period","mucosal atrophy","significant increase","Cellular infiltrations","higher frequency","histopathological changes","Staphylococcus delphini","disease status","acute phase protein serum amyloid","moderate infiltrations of neutrophils","Staphylococcus intermedius group","commercial Danish farms","jejunum","fusion of villi","piglets","loss of balance","neutrophil leukocytes","possible inflammatory state","dehydration","greasy skin exudation","observations","movements of ions","Enterococcus","intra-cytoplasmic eosinophil bodies","enterotoxic effect","distressed behavior","water","correlation","fold","BACKGROUND","present study","days old","slight","CONCLUSION","Mechanisms","RESULTS","specific causative agents","aim","controls","Escherichia coli","death"],"language":"en"},

Improvement in nephrology and urology services with widespread availability of ultrasonography and renal pathology has improved care of renal patients. Proper management of renal stone disease, lupus nephritis, and acute renal failure has decreased these as causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in younger age groups. Older patients are being accepted for dialysis, and 51% of new patients on dialysis were diabetic in 2003. The prevalence of diabetes is rising in the country (presently 7%); glycemic control of such patients is suboptimal. Thirty-three percent of adult Malaysians are hypertensive and blood pressure control is poor (6%). There is a national coordinating committee to oversee the control of diabetes and hypertension in the country. Primary care clinics have been provided with kits to detect microalbuminuria, and ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Prevention of renal failure workshops targeted at primary care doctors have been launched, opportunistic screening at health clinics is being carried out, and public education targeting high-risk groups is ongoing.

Notably, RNA virus genomes are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I\u2013like receptors, thereby activating interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell cultures, we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS\u2019s DNA binding and signaling activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a baseline of innate immune activation.","publish_time":"2018-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Michael T.; Gopinath, Smita; Perez, Corey E.; Linehan, Melissa M.; Crawford, Jason M.; Iwasaki, Akiko; Lindenbach, Brett D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb0d63bfaa10d12ff9be3032e26b0f35d57b53fb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/434027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA viruses","mitochondrial DNA","DNA sensing of RNA viruses","cGAS expression","DNA intermediates","host DNA","cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway","cGAS knockout","cGAS activity","RNA virus restriction","cGAS-mediated sensing of endogenous DNA ligands","RNA virus genomes","RNA virus infections","cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation","basal cGAS activation","cGAS gene knockout","cGAS\u2019s DNA binding","endogenous cellular DNA ligands","important RNA viruses","cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus","Sindbis virus","baseline of innate immune activation","preparatory immune activation state","low-level ISG expression","low-level expression of interferon","innate immune system","uninfected cells","cGAMP synthase activities","endogenous cDNAs","interferon-stimulated gene","response","mechanisms responsible","level of cGAMP","low levels of cGAMP","reconstitution experiments","stimulated genes","steady state","threshold of detection","pattern recognition receptors","mammalian cytosolic RIG","detection of nucleic acids","variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs","human","conserved component","mouse cell cultures","stimuli","viral replication","recent evidence"],"language":"en"},

Aim The purpose of this study is to analyze the results of implementing the mini-CEX into the one-month postgraduate residency training in EM. Materials and methods This study is a retrospective review of mini-CEXs completed by ED faculty members from August 2009 to December 2010. All PGY-1 residents enrolled in this study rotated through the one-month EM training. Each PGY-1 resident received one week of trauma training and three weeks of non-trauma training. The clinical competencies of each PGY-1 resident were evaluated with mini-CEXs, rated by a trauma surgeon and three emergency physicians (EPs). We analyzed the validity of weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and specialty training of ED faculties on observation time, feedback time and rating scores. Results Fifty-seven ED faculty members (42 EPs and 15 trauma surgeons) evaluated 183 PGY-1 residents during the 17 months of EM training. ED faculties with different specialty training provided similar assessment processes. Most competencies were rated significantly higher by trauma surgeons than by EPs. On the computerized mini-CEX rating, no data was missed and junior EPs rated all competencies significantly higher. The evaluators and PGY-1 residents were generally satisfied with the computerized format. As compared to the first assessment, only some competencies of PGY-1 residents were rated significantly higher in subsequent evaluations. Conclusion The seniority and specialty training of ED faculty affected the mini-CEX ratings. The computer-based mini-CEX facilitated complete data gathering but showed differences for ED faculty with different levels of seniority. Further studies of the reliability and validity of the mini-CEX for PGY-1 EM training are needed.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Yu-Che; Chen, Chien-Kuang; Chen, Jih-Chang; Liao, Chien-Hung; Lee, Ching-Hsing; Chen, Yu-Chuan; Ng, Chip-Jin; Huang, Jing-Long; Lee, Shih-Tseng","journal":"Journal of Acute Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad73fe4413e9e8ed60c04d7dec5e5bec4e5d9431.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211558713000551; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211558713000551","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mini-CEX ratings","mini-CEXs","specialty training of ED faculty","computerized mini-CEX rating","month EM training","validity of weekly mini-CEX","competencies of PGY","week of trauma training","months of EM training","specialty training of ED faculties","different specialty training","mini-clinical evaluation","retrospective review of mini","weeks of non-trauma training","ED faculty members","month postgraduate residency training","residents","trauma surgeons","clinical competencies","study","junior EPs","different levels of seniority","impact of seniority","results","observation time","feedback time","limited studies","emergency medicine","broad range of clinical situations","emergency physicians","complete data","rating scores","computerized format","similar assessment processes","differences","methods","exercise","Abstract Background","reliability","Conclusion","subsequent evaluations","Materials","evaluators","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown. METHODS: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (\u003E 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (\u226488.64 pg/mL).

In piglets, ETEC having F4 fimbriae (F4(\u002B) ETEC) induce severe diarrhea, dependent on the presence of receptors for F4 (F4R). In this study, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as an F4R by comparative proteomic analysis of brush border proteins of F4R(\u002B) and F4R(\u2212) pigs and by adherence/internalization experiments on pAPN-transfected cells. Binding of F4 fimbriae to pAPN depended on sialic acid containing carbohydrate moieties, and resulted in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the fimbriae. Endocytosis via pAPN was not restricted to F4 fimbriae, but was also observed for anti-pAPN antibodies. Both F4 fimbriae- and pAPN-specific antibodies were taken up in vivo by porcine enterocytes and induced subsequently a rapid immunoglobulin A and G response. In conclusion, we identified pAPN as an endocytotic receptor for F4 fimbriae and highlight the opportunity to target vaccine antigens to this epithelial receptor.

Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L3) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals was used as control. One sample of 10ml of blood was collected from each animal on the 10, 20, 30, and 45 days after inoculation (dai) and at 30-day intervals thereafter for the remainder of the 210-day experimental period. The blood sample was used for the complete hemogram and platelet count, as well as measurements of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and factors V and VIII. Anemia was observed in infected dogs, 6 weeks after the infection. The eosinophils presented peaks in four periods after infection. Thrombocytopenia became accentuated on the 72dai. Decreased prothrombin time activity and increased partial thromboplastin time were observed at the 6 and 9 weeks after infection and decreased of factors VIII and V activities occurred from 4 to 6 weeks after infection. It may be conclude that infection by A. vasorum in dogs may cause a discrete anemia during the acute phase which is probably regenerative. In addition, important hemostatic alterations due to the infection suggest a chronic intravascular consumption coagulopathy.","publish_time":"2002-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cury, M. C.; Lima, W.

Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that IFN-\u03B2 mRNA levels in EECs infected with EAV VBS were not increased compared to those in mock-infected cells. Consistent with quantitative RT-PCR, Sendai virus- (SeV-) induced type I IFN production was inhibited by EAV infection. Using an IFN-\u03B2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay, we subsequently demonstrated that EAV nsps 1, 2, and 11 had the capability to inhibit type I IFN activation. Of these three nsps, nsp1 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that EAV has the ability to suppress the type I IFN production in EECs and nsp1 may play a critical role to subvert the equine innate immune response.","publish_time":"2014-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Go, Yun Young; Li, Yanhua; Chen, Zhenhai; Han, Mingyuan; Yoo, Dongwan; Fang, Ying; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

One previous study reported a family cluster with asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers. Methods A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families. Results Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs.

DESIGN: Survey with participants randomized to receive a simulated news article accompanied by one of the three graphics that communicated prevalence of influenza and number of influenza-related deaths. SETTING: International online survey PARTICIPANTS: 16,510 adults living in 11 countries selected using stratified random sampling based on age and gender MEASUREMENTS: After reading the article and viewing the presented graphic, participants completed a survey that measured interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, knowledge gained, interest in additional information about the disease, and perception of the graphic. RESULTS: Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease.

It may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim who has been exposed to a particular microorganism or by-product, such as a toxin. Considerable advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. These advances include sequencing, genomics, and microscopy. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For investigative and forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivoin a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schutzer, Steven E.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1633c4e7766b56b8438e82d1c19ef43d7c2baa63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150250.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123820068000219; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820068000219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial forensics investigation","host response","forensic purposes","forensic use","potential victim","container","possible perpetrator","forensic analysis of microbes","central elements","high potential","biological agent","Considerable advances","humoral immune response","Analyses of trace elements","suspected biothreat agent","pollens","identification of vaccine","latent fingerprints","growth media","nonmicrobial nucleic acids","induced immunity","representative examples","chapter","simplified fashion","way","immediate goal","unique signatures","antibiotics","source","characterization","Publisher Summary","underutilized area","innocent person","primary aims","Analytic approaches","by-product","human","animal","vivoin","individuals responsible","sequencing","genomics","environmental sample","microorganisms","toxins","particular microorganism","plant","event","microscopy","evidence","principal methods"],"language":"en"},

A process of coevolution has probably involved exchanges of genetic information between cells and viruses for long evolutionary periods. From this point of view present-day viruses show flexibility in receptor usage and a capacity to alter through mutation their receptor recognition specificity. It is possible that for the complex DNA viruses, due to a likely limited tolerance to generalized high mutation rates, modifications in receptor specificity will be less frequent than for RNA viruses, albeit with similar biological consequences once they occur. It is found that different receptors, or allelic forms of one receptor, may be used with different efficiency and receptor affinities are probably modified by mutation and selection. Receptor abundance and its affinity for a virus may modulate not only the efficiency of infection, but also the capacity of the virus to diffuse toward other sites of the organism. The chapter concludes that receptors may be shared by different, unrelated viruses and that one virus may use several receptors and may expand its receptor specificity in ways that, at present, are largely unpredictable.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baranowski, Eric; Ruiz-Jarabo, Carmen M; Pariente, Nonia; Verdaguer, Nuria; Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fbdfca7f69b26a4f98fe6cfd4947d199b53f75e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119103.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352703620026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352703620026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor specificity","RNA viruses","unrelated viruses","receptor usage","receptor affinities","Receptor abundance","receptor recognition specificity","genome analyses of viruses","complex DNA viruses","different receptors","point of view present-day viruses","different efficiency","cells","capacity","high mutation rates","unicellular organisms","multicellular organisms","efficiency of infection","flexibility","likely limited tolerance","modifications","exchanges of genetic information","picture","allelic forms","similar biological consequences","functional modules","evolutionary periods","affinity","ways","process of coevolution","Publisher Summary","sites","chapter","selection"],"language":"en"},

This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population \u2013 and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grech, Victor","journal":"Early Human Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc85abbb632811bd746725eeb6002a51a0c2eedd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220301973; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220301973; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global infection rates","mortality rates","global pandemic","Estimated infection rates","Public Health","global population","absence of contact","potential resultant mortality","absence of effective treatment","World Health Organisation data","China","level of continents","sober sense of realism","healthcare risks","Wuhan","standard precautions","human cost","social distancing","hand washing","individual countries","intensive care","best-case scenarios","numbers","measures","risk of sounding sensational","infected cases","Middle-Ages","Calculations","Abstract COVID","SARS-CoV","die","epidemiologists","face","vaccination","paper","sufficient size","deaths","way"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to recover the epidemiological history of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Brazil. A descriptive study was conducted in 2009-2010. The Brazilian Information System for reportable diseases (SINAN) was the data source. A total of 105,054 suspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were reported to SINAN. Of these, 53,797 (51.2%) were classified as the new influenza virus subtype. Among the confirmed cases, 56.7% were female, the mean age was 26.31 (SD \u00B1 18.1) years. Fever was the most common sign among the confirmed cases (99.7%) and the presence of comorbidities was reported in 32.5% of cases. In 2009 there were confirmed cases in all 26 Brazilian States and the Federal District. The incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of severe influenza in the population was 28.0 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010. The states of Paran\u00E1 (301.3), Santa Catarina (36.0) and Rio Grande do Sul (27.4) presented the highest incidence; 46.4% of the confirmed cases were hospitalized and 47,643 were cured (93.8%).

Results The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated \u2264 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (\u22120.638 [95% CI, \u22120.809 to \u22120.466] vs \u22120.409 [95% CI, \u22120.663 to \u22120.185] log10 copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated \u003E 2 days of symptom onset.

To improve the technique for defining the links between illnesses and specific strains of HRV, we developed RT-PCR specific for HRV as routine base.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assay for ICV that allows for rapid and accurate detection in a clinical or research setting. STUDY DESIGN: Multiple ICV sequences obtained from GenBank were analyzed, including 141 hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), 106 matrix (M), and 97 nucleoprotein (NP) sequences. Primers and probes were designed based on conserved regions. Multiple primer-probe sets were tested against multiple ICV strains. RESULTS: The ICV M and NP genes offered the most conserved sequence regions. Primers and probes based on newer sequence data offered enhanced detection of ICV, especially for low titer specimens. An NP-targeted assay yielded the best performance and was capable of detecting 10\u2013100 RNA copies per reaction. The NP assay detected multiple clinical isolates of ICV collected in a field epidemiology study conducted in Peru.

The identification of a patient or an outbreak with distinctive clinical features and negative routine microbiological workup is often the starting point for virus hunting. This review appraises the roles of culture, electron microscopy, and nucleic acid detection\u2013based methods in optimizing virus discovery. Cell culture is generally slow but may yield viable virus. Although the choice of cell line often involves trial and error, it may be guided by the clinical syndrome. Electron microscopy is insensitive but fast, and may provide morphological clues to choice of cell line or consensus primers for nucleic acid detection. Consensus primer PCR can be used to detect viruses that are closely related to known virus families. Random primer amplification and high-throughput sequencing can catch any virus genome but cannot yield an infectious virion for testing Koch postulates.

As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khairat, Saif; Meng, Chenlu; Xu, Yuxuan; Edson, Barbara; Gianforcaro, Robert","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252023/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institutional Review Board"],"locations":["North Carolina","United States"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","symptoms of COVID","cohort study of confirmed COVID","highest number of COVID","total virtual visits","cases","use of virtual care","adoption of virtual care","total visits","statewide virtual urgent care center","total patients","conserving health care resources","emergency room visits","areas","world","pandemic","years","state of North Carolina","health systems","coronavirus disease","largest spread","number of females","demand","promising potential","counties","United States","patterns","efficient triaging","high population density","fight","trends","Institutional Review Board exemption","age groups","BACKGROUND","half","CONCLUSIONS","People","major airports","OBJECTIVE","aim","METHODS","numbers","encounters","deaths","hour","data","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Understanding parental decision-making for children\u2019s vaccination is important, particularly among minority groups who are most vulnerable and underserved. This study explored how a subsample of new immigrant mothers from mainland China, a rapidly-growing subpopulation in Hong Kong, made decisions on various childhood and adolescent vaccines for their offspring, and identified key influences affecting their decision making. METHODS: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 Chinese new immigrant mothers recruited by purposive sampling. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach. RESULTS: Participants\u2019 conversation revealed five underlying themes which influenced parents\u2019 vaccination decision-making: (1) Institutional factors, (2) Insufficient vaccination knowledge and advice, (3) Affective impacts on motivation, (4) Vaccination barriers, and (5) Social influences. The role of social norms appeared overwhelmingly salient influencing parents\u2019 vaccination decision making. Institutional factors shaped parent\u2019s perceptions of vaccination necessity. Fear of vaccine-targeted diseases was a key motivating factor for parents adopting vaccination. Insufficient knowledge about vaccines and targeted diseases, lack of advice from health professionals and, if provided, suspicions regarding the motivations for such advice were common issues. Vaccination cost was a major barrier for many new immigrant parents. CONCLUSIONS: Social norms play a key role influencing parental vaccination decision-making. Insight gained from this study will help inform healthcare providers in vaccination communication and policymakers in future vaccination programme.","publish_time":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Linda DL; Lam, Wendy WT; Wu, Joseph T; Liao, Qiuyan; Fielding, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e741d57fb2db417d3a82fae701233ed7d4c5b55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3937074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507384/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["vaccination communication","children\u2019s vaccination","Vaccination cost","Vaccination barriers","parents\u2019 vaccination decision-making","parental vaccination decision-making","Insufficient vaccination knowledge","future vaccination programme","parent\u2019s perceptions of vaccination necessity","salient influencing parents\u2019 vaccination decision making","new immigrant parents","key role","adolescent vaccines","key influences","parental decision-making","Social influences","childhood routine vaccines","role of social norms","Chinese new immigrant mothers","subsample of new immigrant mothers","targeted diseases","uptake rates of optional vaccines","lack of advice","Hong Kong","Institutional factors","Insufficient knowledge","study","key motivating factor","various childhood","immunization coverage rates","Semi-structured in-depth interviews","decisions","policymakers","underlying themes","mainland China","major barrier","growing subpopulation","healthcare providers","offspring","purposive sampling","Participants\u2019 conversation","METHODS","minority groups","motivations","health professionals","Fear of vaccine","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","common issues","Affective impacts","suspicions","CONCLUSIONS","Grounded Theory approach","underserved","Insight","audio"],"language":"en"},

This research aimed to understand media effects on risk perceptions and behaviors concerning the Zika virus in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed a multi-wave nationally representative survey (N = 29,062) and the volume of communications in social and legacy media (i.e., legacy media data from news sources and databases, N = 2,660 and social media data from Twitter, N = 1,605,752) in the United States between April and October 2016, dates coinciding with the early cases of local transmission of Zika in the United States (i.e., 25 weeks). The present study conducted econometric analyses (i.e., Granger causality tests) to assess the associations of legacy and social media coverage with risk perceptions and protective behaviors in the total sample and specific groups separated by pregnancy status/intent, geographic region, income, education level, age, and ethnicity. RESULTS: The results from the overall sample suggested that changes in the volume of information in legacy and social media (i.e., Twitter) were followed by different changes in community risk perceptions and protective behaviors. Specifically, social media coverage correlated with the level of risk perceptions, whereas the legacy media coverage correlated with the level of protective behaviors. Analyses across different subpopulations, including those of different pregnancy status/intent, geographic Zika risk, income, education level, age, and ethnicity, replicated the social media associations with risk perceptions in most cases. However, legacy media and protective behaviors were linked only in some vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., the less-educated populations). CONCLUSION: Understanding how media coverage relates to Zika risk perceptions and protective behaviors will help to facilitate effective risk communications by healthcare professionals and providers, particularly when a health risk emerges.","publish_time":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Man-pui Sally; Winneg, Kenneth; Hawkins, Lauren; Farhadloo, Mohsen; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall; Albarrac\u00EDn, Dolores","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/735d57108addb8299f455abd8b7af1656c80a17e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6093206.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.07.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953618303630; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618303630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["social media coverage","legacy media coverage","social media associations","social media data","legacy media data","media effects","Zika risk perceptions","level of risk perceptions","community risk perceptions","geographic Zika risk","level of protective behaviors","associations of legacy","effective risk communications","education level","United States","Zika virus","different changes","different subpopulations","different pregnancy status","intent","income","sources of information","volume of information","volume of communications","ethnicity","Twitter","RESULTS","early cases of local transmission of Zika","geographic region","total sample","news sources","overall sample","econometric analyses","vulnerable subpopulations","face of emerging public health risks","specific groups","providers","databases","multi-wave","healthcare professionals","Granger causality tests","representative survey","television","newspapers","present study","METHODS","dates","weeks","research","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N). Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. RESULTS: In 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R(2) = 0.83; N gene, R(2) = 0.87). 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 \u00B1 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 \u00B1 1965 copies/test, p \u003C 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 \u00B1 501 copies/test, p \u003C 0.001). Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 \u00B1 17272 vs 1252 \u00B1 1027, p \u003C 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.

This study evaluated the association between the detection of multiple viruses by RT\u2010PCR and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: Children less than 2 years of age with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively included during three winter seasons. Patients were categorized in three groups based on disease severity; mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Multiplex RT\u2010PCR of 15 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. RESULTS: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono\u2010infections. CONCLUSION: Disease severity in children with bronchiolitis is not associated with infection by multiple viruses. We conclude that other factors, such as age, contribute to disease severity to a larger extent.

We recommended screening all newly admitted infants at high risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of their family history. Only high-risk patients should receive a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. However, all high-risk neonates should be isolated in a single room, preferably in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Based on existing experience, some patients initially present with mild flu-like symptoms but rapidly develop respiratory distress and multiple organ failure. Admitting all neonates with COVID-19 to the NICU could ensure the availability of close monitoring and necessary interventions.2 However, each clinical setting should consider its bed surge capacity in case of a COVID-19 outbreak and adopt a flexible and variable approach to admitting patients. We recommend an individualised treatment strategy in the management of patients with COVID-19. The pathological findings from a patient who died from COVID-19 are consistent with the histological rationale for neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),3 , 4 indicating the probability of secondary impairment of surfactant function and pulmonary hypertension in the case of severe neonatal COVID-19. Therefore, surfactant administration and inhaled nitric oxide are expected to be effective in infants with severe COVID-19. We agree with the recommendation that a physiology-based ventilation method should be used and that extracorporeal life support should only be provided as a rescue approach.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jianhui; Shi, Yuan","journal":"Lancet Child Adolesc Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129385.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151318/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464220300729; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352464220300729; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2352-4642(20)30072-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Daniele De Luca"],"organizations":["NICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","case of severe neonatal COVID","high-risk patients","management of patients","admitted neonates","high-risk neonates","neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","admitted infants","SARS-CoV","NICU","neonatal intensive care unit","surfactant administration","necessary interventions","variable approach","rescue approach","high risk of coronavirus disease","physiology-based ventilation method","probability of secondary impairment of surfactant function","pulmonary hypertension","histological rationale","ARDS","nucleic acid test","bed surge capacity","symptoms","inhaled nitric oxide","availability of close monitoring","clinical setting","mild flu","multiple organ failure","outbreak","individualised treatment strategy","Luca","reflections","recommendation","existing experience","screening","basis","single room","extracorporeal life support","family history","pathological findings","Daniele","Comment"],"language":"en"},

Culture of cells in monolayers is the most common method used in diagnostic virology laboratories. Primary or secondary cultures cells retain their diploid chromosome number, a factor which makes them particularly susceptible to certain viruses. The ideal cell system for a diagnostic virology laboratory would be a continuous line which retained its diploid chromosome number. It would be impossible in a routine laboratory to inoculate each specimen into every type of cell culture. A routine procedure is therefore employed and the specimen is inoculated into three types of cells which will support the growth of as many viruses as possible. Mixed culture technique (cocultivation) has proved of value when a viral agent is difficult to isolate from the original tissue, for example, isolation of measles from a brain biopsy. Cultures of chopped tissues have been used for many years to support the growth of viruses but the techniques were not readily applicable to diagnostic virology. A simple method of cultivating fragments of ciliated epithelium was described, which resulted in the isolation of new rhinoviruses and a new member of the corona virus group.","publish_time":"2012-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moffat, Margaret A.J.","journal":"Tissue Culture","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149990.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124271500501376; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124271500501376","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Culture of cells","diagnostic virology laboratory","diagnostic medical virology","diagnostic virology laboratories","cell culture procedures","type of cell culture","growth of viruses","diploid chromosome number","secondary cultures cells","specimen","types of cells","routine laboratory","Mixed culture technique","certain viruses","isolation of new rhinoviruses","ideal cell system","new member","common method","isolation of measles","routine procedure","Cultures of chopped tissues","simple method of cultivating fragments of ciliated epithelium","invaluable tool","continuous line","value","example","original tissue","corona virus group","cocultivation","factor","techniques","monolayers","viral agent","brain biopsy","years","chapter"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The incidence rates of cancers (2001-2014), communicable diseases (2003-2016), and non-communicable diseases (1990-2017) were retrieved, classified, and analyzed retrospectively during November 2017, based on data available with the Ministry of Health and were analyzed at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University in Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) (per 100,000 population) of breast cancer among women increased dramatically from 11.8 in 2001 to 22.7 in 2014, indicating a 92.4% increase over the decade. Colorectal cancer incidence was the highest among men, and its ASR per 100,000 population increased from 5.0 to 10.6 in men and from 5.0 to 8.2 in women. Among communicable diseases, incidences of hepatitis B, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis decreased while dengue fever increased. An alarming increase was observed in the incidence rate of non-communicable diseases namely, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of non-communicable diseases increased over the decade and was associated with increased mortality and disability, reduced quality of life, and increased health-care costs, indicating an urgent need to establish prevention and control programs. The rising trend in the incidence of cancers may also become a health care issue in Saudi Arabia in the coming years.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herzallah, Hatem K.; Antonisamy, Belavendra R.; Shafee, Mohammed H.; Al-Otaibi, Sultan T.","journal":"Saudi Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d8a94b596784c4280b895452b7f3d0e86b588b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6468216.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2019.3.23585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASR"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["incidence rate of non-communicable diseases","incidence of cancers","incidence rates of cancers","increased mortality","Colorectal cancer incidence","Age-standardized incidence rate","increased health-care costs","decade","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","health care issue","common cancers","Ministry of Health","ASR","population","women","breast cancer","alarming increase","Dammam","reduced quality of life","Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University","urgent need","incidences of hepatitis B","chickenpox","measles","disability","obesity","brucellosis","prevention","RESULTS","diabetes","control programs","coming years","data available","trends","rising trend","METHODS","CONCLUSION","dengue fever","hypertension","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Further, relative humidity, particle aggregation and mucus properties influence expelled particle size and subsequent transmission.

Identification of GIs in bacterial genomes is an important task since many of them represent inserts that may contribute to bacterial evolution and pathogenesis. In order to characterize and distinguish GIs from rest of the genome, binary classification of islands based on n-gram frequency distribution have been performed. It consists of testing the agreement of islands n-gram frequency distributions with the complete genome and backbone sequence. In addition, a statistic based on the maximal order Markov model is used to identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams in islands. The results may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis suggesting that some of the n-grams are overrepresented in a subset of islands and underrepresented in the backbone, or vice versa, thus complementing the binary classification. The method is applied to strain-specific regions in the Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 genome (O-islands), resulting in two groups of O-islands with different n-gram characteristics. It refines a characterization based on other compositional features such as G \u002B C content and codon usage, and may help in identification of GIs, and also in research and development of adequate drugs targeting virulence genes in them.","publish_time":"2008-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavlovi\u0107-La\u017Eeti\u0107, Gordana M.; Miti\u0107, Nenad S.; Beljanski, Milo\u0161 V.","journal":"Comput Methods Programs Biomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/650f81f4234b8adc6190c3a20625565f7ffa42a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185697.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016926070800254X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19101056/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016926070800254X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2008.10.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["G   C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-islands","genomic islands","subset of islands","binary classification of islands","agreement of islands n-gram frequency distributions","underrepresented n-grams","different n-gram characteristics","Identification of GIs","based method","complete genome","analysis of bacterial genome segments","H7 EDL933 genome","bacterial genomes","bacterial evolution","groups of O","backbone sequence","maximal order Markov model","Escherichia coli O157","C content","development of adequate drugs","strain-specific regions","compositional features","codon usage","virulence genes","statistic","research","important task","rest","novel","basis","inserts","characterization","Zipf","pathogenesis","paper","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase ( \u03BB -Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and \u03BB -Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashimoto, Y.; Lawrence, P.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality of ARDS in Taiwan. We conducted a nationwide inpatient cohort study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2011. A total of 40,876 ARDS patients (68% male; mean age 66 years) were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition coding and further analyzed for clinical characteristics, medical costs, and mortality. The overall crude incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 2.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 person-years during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence of ARDS was 15.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 57.8%. In-hospital mortality decreased from 59.7% in 1997 to 47.5% in 2011 (P \u003C 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18\u201329 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (\u003E80 years, P \u003C 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 \u00B1 17 versus 62 \u00B1 19, P \u003C 0.001) and predominantly male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P \u003C 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P \u003C 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P \u003C 0.001) than patients who survived. We provide the first large-scale epidemiological analysis of ARDS incidence and outcomes in Asia. Although the overall incidence was lower than has been reported in a prospective US study, this may reflect underdiagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition code and identification of only patients with more severe ARDS in this analysis. Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates in recent years, likely because of the implementation of lung-protective ventilation.","publish_time":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei; Chen, Yih-Yuan; Tsai, Ching-Fang; Chen, Solomon Chih-Cheng; Lin, Ming-Shian; Ware, Lorraine B.; Chen, Chuan-Mu","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b5d40c82f807736a65c47b53824f36e220ef9d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4985407.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000001849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["ARDS patients","year mortality of ARDS","hospital mortality rate","person-years","overall incidence","overall crude incidence of ARDS","severe ARDS","year mortality rates","age-adjusted incidence of ARDS","recent years","youngest patients","oldest patients","study period","large-scale epidemiological analysis of ARDS incidence","prospective US study","International Classification of Diseases","hospitalization","nationwide inpatient cohort study","mean age","Asia","male","higher medical costs","edition coding","edition code","US Dollars","epidemiological studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome","Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database","implementation of lung","clinical characteristics","identification","underdiagnosis","outcomes","western countries","protective ventilation","shorter lengths of stay","decreasing trend","days","addition","total","aim"],"language":"en"},

We conducted systematic prioritization of zoonotic diseases and developed a ranked list of these diseases that would guide allocation of resources to enhance their surveillance, prevention, and control. METHODS: A group of 36 medical, veterinary, and wildlife experts in zoonoses from government, research institutions and universities in Kenya prioritized 36 diseases using a semi-quantitative One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with slight adaptations. The tool comprises five steps: listing of zoonotic diseases to be prioritized, development of ranking criteria, weighting criteria by pairwise comparison through analytical hierarchical process, scoring each zoonotic disease based on the criteria, and aggregation of scores. RESULTS: In order of importance, the participants identified severity of illness in humans, epidemic/pandemic potential in humans, socio-economic burden, prevalence/incidence and availability of interventions (weighted scores assigned to each criteria were 0.23, 0.22, 0.21, 0.17 and 0.17 respectively), as the criteria to define the relative importance of the diseases. The top five priority diseases in descending order of ranking were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis and Rift Valley fever. CONCLUSION: Although less prominently mentioned, neglected zoonotic diseases ranked highly compared to those with epidemic potential suggesting these endemic diseases cause substantial public health burden. The list of priority zoonotic disease is crucial for the targeted allocation of resources and informing disease prevention and control programs for zoonoses in Kenya.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munyua, Peninah; Bitek, Austine; Osoro, Eric; Pieracci, Emily G.; Muema, Josephat; Mwatondo, Athman; Kungu, Mathew; Nanyingi, Mark; Gharpure, Radhika; Njenga, Kariuki; Thumbi, Samuel M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78c82f8e3198d5c95cbbcceabefddbe82e8f2442.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4996421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27557120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization","Rift Valley"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["priority diseases","systematic prioritization of zoonotic diseases","endemic diseases","disease prevention","Disease Control","Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool","list of priority zoonotic disease","weighting criteria","development of ranking criteria","socio-economic burden","control important","control programs","substantial public health burden","humans","zoonoses","epidemic potential","Kenya","order of importance","ranked list","descending order of ranking","targeted allocation of resources","socio-economic impact","pandemic potential","weighted scores","relative importance","aggregation of scores","rabies","time","Centers","brucellosis","government","trypanosomiasis","anthrax","incidence","prevalence","comparison","geographical settings","wildlife experts","availability of interventions","analytical hierarchical process","research institutions","severity of illness","participants","universities","Rift Valley fever","surveillance","slight adaptations","national level","group","steps","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The interferon-inducible 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, group A rotavirus (RVA) VP3 carboxy-terminal domain (VP3-CTD), and mammalian AKAP7 are members of 2H phosphoesterase superfamily with 2\u2032-phosphodiesterase (2\u2032-PDE) activity that potently cleaves 2-5A thereby preventing activation of RNase L (Zhao, Jha et al., PMID: 22704621; Zhang, Jha et al., PMID: 23878220 and Gusho, Zhang, Jha et al., PMID: 24987090). Here, we will demonstrate that Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV gene NS4b encodes a homologous and similar PDE that cleaves 2-5A in vitro (km/Kcat=12.1M\u22121 s\u22121), inhibits 2-5A accumulation in cell culture and prevents ribosomal (r) RNA degradation in murine bone marrow macrophages (BMM), a hallmark of RNase L antagonism, and rescues an MHV mutant virus with a catalytically inactive NS2a protein unable to antagonize RNase L in vivo. Interestingly, NS4b has a nuclear localization signal however there is a mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic localization when overexpressed in human airway cell line A549 and in BMM when expressed from chimeric MHV. Viral evasion of OAS/RNase L pathway is a critical hepatovirulence determinant for lineage A Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Taken together, our data suggest that RNase L antagonism may be a critical component of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Additionally, this is the first evidence of RNase L antagonism by a lineage C Betacoronavirus.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jha, Babal K.; Thornbrough, Joshua M.; Goldstein, Stephen A.; Elliott, Ruth; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466615004731; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466615004731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zhang"],"organizations":["OAS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["hallmark of RNase","activation of RNase","evidence of RNase","antagonism","PMID","Jha","MHV mutant virus","chimeric MHV","BMM","Zhang","Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","critical component of MERS","lineage C Betacoronavirus","productive virus infection","CoV gene NS4b","nuclear localization signal","Viral evasion of OAS","VP3-CTD","murine coronavirus","cytoplasmic localization","viral countermeasures","cell culture","CoV pathogenesis","similar PDE","critical hepatovirulence determinant","accessory protein ns2","murine bone marrow macrophages","VP3 carboxy-terminal domain","inactive NS2a protein unable","potent host antiviral pathway","human airway cell line A549","RNA degradation","RVA","rotavirus","members","mammalian AKAP7","components","Middle East respiratory syndrome","H phosphoesterase superfamily","Zhao","phosphodiesterase","innate immunity","accumulation","ribonuclease","Gusho","synthetases","data","interferon-inducible","Kcat","oligoadenylate","activity"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. The virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to address questions regarding virus\u2013host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here, we presented a detailed study of PDCoV-induced replication organelles. All positive-strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. All coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). In addition, Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while Gammacoronaviruses induce the formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with tethered double-membrane spherules. However, the structures induced by Deltacoronaviruses, particularly the presence of convoluted membranes or double-membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus-induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles. Significantly, however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum, small associated tethered vesicles, and double-membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doyle, Nicole; Hawes, Philippa C.; Simpson, Jennifer; Adams, Lorin H.; Maier, Helena J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3618a7956fc136c7183df5b9c665e96a3df8748.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893519.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694296/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11111030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alpha"],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV replication","virus replication","formation of double","induced replication organelles","membrane vesicles","virus-induced membrane rearrangements","tethered double-membrane spherules","strains of PDCoV","formation of convoluted membranes","dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication","formation of regions","detailed study of PDCoV","pigs","formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum","Gammacoronavirus genera","genera of coronavirus","onset of viral RNA synthesis","protein synthesis","presence of convoluted membranes","avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","Alpha","structures","small associated tethered vesicles","rearrangement of cellular membranes","positive-strand RNA viruses","Gammacoronaviruses","host cell interactions","infected cells","questions","Betacoronaviruses","progeny particle release","development of tissue culture","electron microscopy","samples","history of severe diarrhea","Deltacoronaviruses","date","DMVs","Hong Kong","addition","countries","world","Porcine deltacoronavirus","USA"],"language":"en"},

Poverty alleviation has moved strongly forward in China and the major health indicators are now better than the average of all middle- and high-income countries. However, the dual burden of infectious and chronic diseases remains a challenge with respect to achieving the health target in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development goals (SDGs). In 2015, about 44% of the poor population in China were impoverished by illness but already in 2018, multi-sectoral actions delivered by the Health-related Poverty Alleviation programme had reduced the number almost by half. In the past three years 15 million poor people (98% of the poor population) with infectious and chronic diseases had been treated and taken care of thanks to financial support through multiple health insurance schemes and other governmental subsidies. This article discusses the lessons learnt with regard to health-related poverty alleviation in China with special reference to those still remaining impoverished by illness. Consolidation of the achievements reached and provision of basic needs to those still disadvantaged and in poor health will require a major improvement of accessibility to, and affordability of, health services. The next step towards enhanced productivity and better living conditions will involve upgrading of the capacity of health professionals in the poor regions, promotion of coherent efforts in health-related poverty alleviation and rural revitalization measures. As an additional measure, data monitoring and research on health poverty alleviation should be strengthened as they are essential to generate the evidence and knowledge needed to support the move in the direction envisioned by the SDGs, and the new Healthy China 2030 programme.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yun-Ping; Zhou, Xiao-Nong","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bd92243bc19bc49fe89f6dc278614adf8cbdf4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6990531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996258/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-0626-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["poor health","health poverty alleviation","health target","health services","Health-related Poverty Alleviation programme","major health indicators","capacity of health professionals","poor population","poor people","multiple health insurance schemes","poor regions","chronic diseases","new Healthy China","SDGs","five-year programme","illness","financial support","dual burden of infectious","better living conditions","major improvement of accessibility","Agenda","research","promotion of coherent efforts","United Nations","data monitoring","sustainable development goals","regard","special reference","rural revitalization measures","enhanced productivity","respect","challenge","governmental subsidies","care of thanks","achievements","provision of basic needs","additional measure","step","affordability","number","multi-sectoral actions","average","Chinese Government","lessons","years","high-income countries","evidence","knowledge","Consolidation","article","milestone","half","direction"],"language":"en"},

An international spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has attracted global attention. ZIKV is conveyed by a mosquito vector, Aedes species, which also acts as the vector species of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Methods. Arrival time of ZIKV importation (i.e., the time at which the first imported case was diagnosed) in each imported country was collected from publicly available data sources. Employing a survival analysis model in which the hazard is an inverse function of the effective distance as informed by the airline transportation network data, and using dengue and chikungunya virus transmission data, risks of importation and local transmission were estimated. Results. A total of 78 countries with imported case(s) have been identified, with the arrival time ranging from 1 to 44 weeks since the first ZIKV was identified in Brazil, 2015. Whereas the risk of importation was well explained by the airline transportation network data, the risk of local transmission appeared to be best captured by additionally accounting for the presence of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Discussion. The risk of importation may be high given continued global travel of mildly infected travelers but, considering that the public health concerns over ZIKV infection stems from microcephaly, it is more important to focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve pregnant women. The predicted risk of local transmission was frequently seen in tropical and subtropical countries with dengue or chikungunya epidemic experience.","publish_time":"2016-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nah, Kyeongah; Mizumoto, Kenji; Miyamatsu, Yuichiro; Yasuda, Yohei; Kinoshita, Ryo; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6d409a4fff5c3c4d7d84cee872e80615e2027a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4824915.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069825/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1904","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["risk of importation","chikungunya virus transmission data","predicted risk of local transmission","Arrival time of ZIKV importation","widespread transmission","chikungunya viruses","ZIKV infection stems","vector species of dengue","airline transportation network data","risks of importation","presence of dengue","imported case","chikungunya epidemic experience","available data sources","imported country","subtropical countries","global attention","mosquito vector","Aedes species","international spread of Zika virus","high given continued global travel","public health concerns","hazard","infected travelers","microcephaly","effective distance","inverse function","survival analysis model","pregnant women","total","weeks","Brazil","Background","Methods","Results","Discussion"],"language":"en"},

The MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. To facilitate these efforts, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme by X-ray crystallography. The molecule consists of a ubiquitin-like domain and a catalytic core domain. The catalytic domain displays an extended right-hand fold with a zinc ribbon and embraces a solvent-exposed substrate-binding region. The overall structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro is similar to that of the corresponding SARS-CoV enzyme, but the architecture of the oxyanion hole and of the S3 as well as the S5 specificity sites differ from the latter. These differences are the likely reason for reduced in vitro peptide hydrolysis and deubiquitinating activities of the MERS-CoV PLpro, compared to the homologous enzyme from the SARS coronavirus. Introduction of a side-chain capable of oxyanion stabilization through the Leu106Trp mutation greatly enhances the in vitro catalytic activity of the MERS-CoV PLpro. The unique features observed in the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro should allow the design of antivirals that would not interfere with host ubiquitin-specific proteases.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Jian; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Drosten, Christian; Anem\u00FCller, Stefan; Ma, Qingjun; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6818303fae83016107e78aeaf0e96f681beb3794.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113875.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992731/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214001739; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214001739; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.06.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV PLpro","MERS-CoV papain","corresponding SARS-CoV enzyme","catalytic domain","catalytic core domain","crystal structure","three-dimensional structure","catalytic activity","overall structure","homologous enzyme","SARS coronavirus","oxyanion hole","chain capable of oxyanion stabilization","host ubiquitin-specific proteases","Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","extended right-hand fold","zinc ribbon","severe acute pneumonia","peptide hydrolysis","deubiquitinating activities","potential target","Leu106Trp mutation","solvent-exposed substrate-binding region","likely reason","renal failure","S3","architecture","development of antiviral drugs","X-ray crystallography","unique features","design of antivirals","S5 specificity sites","differences","Introduction","efforts","molecule"],"language":"en"},

Thus, they are good candidates to develop novel oral vectors, constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for mucosal delivery strategies. Herein, this review summarizes our research, up until now, on the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines. Most of our work has been based on the model LAB Lactococcus lactis, for which we have developed efficient genetic tools, including expression signals and host strains, for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins such as antigens, cytokines and enzymes. Resulting recombinant lactococci strains have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in different animal models: i) against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)-induced tumors in mice, ii) to partially prevent a bovine \u03B2-lactoglobulin (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice and iii) to regulate body weight and food consumption in obese mice. Strikingly, all of these tools have been successfully transposed to the Lactobacillus genus, in recent years, within our laboratory. Notably, anti-oxidative Lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested in two chemically-induced colitis models. In parallel, we also developed a strategy based on the use of L. lactis to deliver DNA at the mucosal level, and were able to show that L. lactis is able to modulate the host response through DNA delivery. Today, we consider that all of our consistent data, together with those obtained by other groups, demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using LAB, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human clinical trials.","publish_time":"2011-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berm\u00FAdez-Humar\u00E1n, Luis G; Kharrat, Pascale; Chatel, Jean-Marc; Langella, Philippe","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f855365da2675234802a5f218bda88aacc089b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3231930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21995317/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-10-s1-s4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA delivery","novel therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors","mucosal delivery strategies","host strains","use of LAB","therapeutic effects","mucosal level","lactobacilli strains","recombinant lactococci strains","heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins","model LAB Lactococcus lactis","novel oral vectors","DNA vaccines","obese mice","anti-oxidative Lactobacillus casei strains","induced colitis models","expression signals","host response","food consumption","Lactobacillus genus","induced tumors","different animal models","human papillomavirus type","efficient genetic tools","human clinical trials","Food-grade Lactic Acid Bacteria","attractive alternatives","attenuated pathogens","BLG","HPV","body weight","antigens","recent years","allergic reaction","prophylactic","good candidates","cytokines","bovine \u03B2-lactoglobulin","centuries","humans","fermented foods","laboratory","enzymes","strategy","review","research","consistent data","work","groups"],"language":"en"},

This study intended to clarify whether DV infection could induce autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of DV induced autophagy on viral replication and DV-related pathogenesis was investigated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The physiopathological parameters were evaluated after DV2 was intracranially injected into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice. Autophagy-related markers were monitored by immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Double-membrane autophagic vesicles were investigated by transmission-electron-microscopy. DV non-structural-protein-1 (NS1) expression (indicating DV infection) was detected in the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice. In these infected tissues, increased LC3 puncta formation, LC3-II expression, double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (autophagosome), amphisome, and decreased p62 accumulation were observed, indicating that DV2 induces the autophagic progression in vivo. Amphisome formation was demonstrated by colocalization of DV2-NS1 protein or LC3 puncta and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) in DV2-infected brain tissues. We further manipulated DV-induced autophagy by the inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA), which accordingly promoted or suppressed the disease symptoms and virus load in the brain of the infected mice. We demonstrated that DV2 infection of the suckling mice induces autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV replication and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ying-Ray; Hu, Hsuan-Yun; Kuo, Szu-Han; Lei, Huan-Yao; Lin, Yee-Shin; Yeh, Trai-Ming; Liu, Ching-Chuan; Liu, Hsiao-Sheng","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b263e22abc98f73d06f4d7baa292027c941f3c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3848819.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-20-65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24011333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DV","ICR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DV replication","DV infection","effect of DV induced autophagy","manipulated DV-induced autophagy","DV2 infection","DV-related pathogenesis","infected mice","DV2-infected brain tissues","colocalization of DV2","DV non-structural-protein","infected tissues","Autophagy-related markers","increased LC3 puncta formation","NS1 protein","viral replication","expression","double-membrane autophagosome","Amphisome formation","Double-membrane autophagic vesicles","day-old ICR suckling mice","promoting role","supportive role","autophagic progression","endosome marker","immunohistochemical","mannose","phosphate receptor","DVs","MPR","inducer rapamycin","immunofluorescent staining","virus load","dengue viruses","inhibitor","various cell lines","Western blotting","transmission-electron","physiopathological parameters","medulla","midbrain","decreased p62 accumulation","disease symptoms","methyladenine","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","cerebrum","microscopy","study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Instead of setting a single minimum support threshold for all items, they allow users to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items, and an Apriori-based algorithm, named MSapriori, is developed to mine all frequent itemsets. In this paper, we study the same problem but with two additional improvements. First, we propose a FP-tree-like structure, MIS-tree, to store the crucial information about frequent patterns. Accordingly, an efficient MIS-tree-based algorithm, called the CFP-growth algorithm, is developed for mining all frequent itemsets. Second, since each item can have its own minimum support, it is very difficult for users to set the appropriate thresholds for all items at a time. In practice, users need to tune items\u0027 supports and run the mining algorithm repeatedly until a satisfactory end is reached.

In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to identify the most vital and effective immunogenic protein from the proteome of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 that may be suitable to stimulate a significant immune response aiding in the development of peptide vaccine against leptospirosis. Both B-cell and T-cell (Helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)) epitopes were predicted for the conserved and most immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein. Further, the binding interaction of CTL epitopes with Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) was evaluated using docking techniques.

We evaluated colonic structural, microbiomic and functional changes in old female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus) and how age-related leaky gut alters responses to Western diet. We additionally assessed serum bovine immunoglobulin therapy to lower MT burden. MT was increased in old monkeys despite comparable histological appearance of the ascending colon. Microbiome profiles from 16S sequencing did not show large differences by age grouping, but there was evidence for higher mucosal bacterial loads using qPCR. Innate immune responses were increased in old monkeys consistent with higher MT burdens. Western diet challenge led to elevations in glycemic and hepatic biochemistry values only in old monkeys, and immunoglobulin therapy was not effective in reducing MT markers or improving metabolic health. We interpret these findings to suggest that ageing may lead to lower control over colonization at the mucosal surface, and reduced clearance of pathogens resulting in MT and inflammation. Leaky gut in ageing, which is not readily rescued by innate immune support with immunoglobulin, primes the liver for negative consequences of high fat, high sugar diets.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Quentin N.; Wells, Magan; Davis, Ashley T.; Sherrill, Christina; Tsilimigras, Matthew C.

The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effective method for the large-scale production of P. falciparum cell banks suitable for use in clinical trials. METHODS: Genetically-attenuated parasites (GAP) were produced by targeted deletion of the gene encoding the knob associated histidine rich protein (kahrp) from P. falciparum strain 3D7. A GAP master cell bank (MCB) was manufactured by culturing parasites in an FDA approved single use, closed system sterile plastic bioreactor. All components used to manufacture the MCB were screened to comply with standards appropriate for in vivo use. The cryopreserved MCB was subjected to extensive testing to ensure GMP compliance for a phase 1 investigational product. RESULTS: Two hundred vials of the GAP MCB were successfully manufactured. At harvest, the GAP MCB had a parasitaemia of 6.3%, with 96% of parasites at ring stage. Testing confirmed that all release criteria were met (sterility, absence of viral contaminants and endotoxins, parasite viability following cryopreservation, identity and anti-malarial drug sensitivity of parasites). CONCLUSION: Large-scale in vitro culture of P. falciparum parasites using a wave bioreactor can be achieved under GMP-compliant conditions.

Long-term, robust growth of human DAECs was achieved using co-culture with feeder cells and supplementation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y27632, and the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ). Removal of feeders and priming with DBZ and a cocktail of lung maturation factors prevented the spontaneous differentiation into airway club cells and instead induced differentiation to alveolar epithelial cells.

Methods: The synergistic activity and the bactericidal activity of colistin in combination with resveratrol was investigated by checkerboard assays and time-kill assays, respectively. A total of 21 strains were investigated, including 16 strains of different species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 6, Escherichia coli, n = 6; Citrobacter braakii, n = 1; Stenotrophomonas malthophilia, n = 1; Enterobacter cloaceae, n = 1; Acinetobacter baumannii, n = 1) with acquired colistin resistance, three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae precursors, and two strains of intrinsically colistin-resistant species (Serratia marcescens, n = 1; Proteus mirabilis, n = 1). Mechanisms of acquired colistin resistance included chromosomal mutations (i.e., mgrB, pmrAB) and plasmid genes (mcr-1, mcr-1.2). Results: Resveratrol did not show any significant intrinsic antimicrobial activity. Overall, a relevant synergistic antimicrobial activity of resveratrol in combination with colistin was observed with all tested strains, except for the three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae strains, and for two mcr-1-positive E. coli strains. In time-kill assays, performed with 15 selected strains, the combination of colistin 2 mg/L plus resveratrol 128 mg/L was bactericidal with 11 strains, and bacteriostatic for the remaining ones. Conclusions: Resveratrol was found to potentiate colistin activity against a wide panel of colistin-resistant strains, regardless of species and resistance mechanisms, which would deserve further investigation for potential clinical applications.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cannatelli, Antonio; Principato, Silvia; Colavecchio, Olga L.; Pallecchi, Lucia; Rossolini, Gian Maria","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15724c0c0f8675d894aa76e25c9a29f4266d0440.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6091244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Acinetobacter","K. pneumoniae","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["colistin activity","combination of colistin","colistin-susceptible","bactericidal activity of colistin","resistant strains","pneumoniae strains","colistin-resistant species","coli strains","acquired colistin resistance","selected strains","tested strains","wide panel of colistin","strains of different species","synergistic activity","relevant synergistic antimicrobial activity of resveratrol","mcr","significant intrinsic antimicrobial activity","resistance mechanisms","Klebsiella pneumoniae","pneumoniae precursors","checkerboard assays","time","multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens","Escherichia coli","treatment of severe infections","mgrB","pmrAB","chromosomal mutations","plasmid genes","resort agent","investigation","Enterobacter cloaceae","Stenotrophomonas malthophilia","Citrobacter braakii","Serratia","Acinetobacter baumannii","potential clinical applications","study","Proteus mirabilis","remaining ones","Methods","Objectives","Results","Conclusions","total"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The research for this review were based in the Scopus and Web of Science databases using terms combining Juniperus, secondary metabolites names, and biological activities. This is not an exhaustive review of Juniperus compounds with biological activities, but rather a critical selection taking into account the following criteria: (i) studies involving the most recent methodologies for quantitative evaluation of biological activities; and (ii) the compounds with the highest number of studies published in the last four years. Results: From Juniperus species, several diterpenes, flavonoids, and one lignan were emphasized taking into account their level of activity against several targets. Antitumor activity is by far the most studied, being followed by antibacterial and antiviral activities. Deoxypodophyllotoxin and one dehydroabietic acid derivative appears to be the most promising lead compounds.

The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues. METHODS: We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission: direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search. RESULTS: Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula: see text] ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula: see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula: see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula: see text] ) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.

The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios.

Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro- cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples were screened for HBoV and HPV DNA. Positive tissue sections were afterward subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to identify HBoV and HPV infected cells. By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. Results: In total 62 of 103 (60, 19%) of the tonsil squamous cell carcinomas tested positive for HBoV DNA and 66 of 103 (66%) samples were identified as HPV positive. The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that human bocavirus infections as a cofactor may have an impact on tumor development in tonsils, although it still remains possible that HBoV solely displays a tumor tropism.","publish_time":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00F6pken, Merle; F\u00F6rster, Isabel; Maune, Steffen; Brockmann, Michael; Schildgen, Oliver; Schildgen, Verena","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d650d31956785474d9b36835d13006b28c508ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6232770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSI","HPV","FISH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV DNA","HBoV positive tumors","HPV positive","HPV DNA","HPV infection","HPV infected cells","co-participation of HBoV","HPV negative","tumor tissue","Positive tissue sections","double infection of HPV","cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors","lung tumors","infected host cells","tumor development","adenotonsillar tissue","target cells of virus replication","tumor tropism","infected tissues","MSI testing","paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples","chronic virus infection","primary tonsil fibroblasts","tonsil squamous cell carcinomas","FISH analysis","human bocavirus infections","cofactor","tonsils","Background","DNA damage response system","single infections","microsatellite instability","microsatellite markers","de-multiplexed PCR","cell culture model","pro- cancerogenic cytokines","fluorescent detection of PCR products","keratinocytes","terms","role","important site of HBoV1 persistence","hypothesis","fluorescence","published protocol","capillary sequencing device","findings","situ hybridization","impact","viruses","lymphocytes","correlates","Formalin","oropharyngeal cancers","Methods","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

By solving 2.1\u20132.5 \u00C5 resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intra-molecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain. In order to dissect possible regulatory functions of NTD, we designed mutations at residues Y471 and E472 to perturb key interactions at the NTD\u2013RdRP interface. When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an \u2018open\u2019 conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD\u2013RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected. Collectively, our work demonstrates an explicit and unique mode of polymerase fidelity modulation and provides a vivid example of co-evolution in multi-domain enzymes.","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Weichi; Shi, Xiaoling; Gong, Peng","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96602c07c439a97e001abcd2e9c85fda998d64c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6237809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RdRP interactions","RdRP interface","RdRP assays","RdRP palm domain","key interactions","RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","RNA synthesis","RNA viruses","optimal fidelity level","NS5B interface mutants","high-resolution intra-molecular interactions","possible regulatory functions of NTD","unique mode of polymerase fidelity modulation","multi-domain enzymes","NS5B elongation complex","fused N-terminal domain","virus viability","classical swine fever virus","vivid example of co-evolution","CSFV","RdRPs","\u00C5 resolution crystal structures","E472","residues Y471","mutations","processivity","perturbation","order","work","Data","fitness","proofreading","conformation","precise mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes supply fatty acids and lysophospholipids from membrane phospholipids, thereby variably affecting cutaneous homeostasis. Accordingly, perturbation of particular PLA(2)-driven lipid pathways can be linked to various forms of skin disease. In this review article, we highlight the roles of several PLA(2) subtypes in cutaneous pathophysiology, as revealed by transgenic/knockout studies in combination with comprehensive lipidomics. We focus mainly on secreted PLA(2) group IIF (sPLA(2)-IIF), which is associated with epidermal hyperplasia through mobilization of a unique lipid metabolite. We also address the distinct roles of sPLA(2)-IIE in hair follicles and sPLA(2)-IID in lymphoid immune cells that secondarily affect cutaneous inflammation, and provide some insights into species differences in sPLA(2)s. Additionally, we briefly overview the patatin-like phospholipase PNPLA1, which belongs to the Ca(2\u002B)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) family, as a key regulator of skin barrier function through catalysis of a unique non-PLA(2) reaction. These knowledges on lipid metabolism driven by various PLA(2) subtypes will open novel opportunities for translated studies toward diagnosis and therapy of human skin diseases.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murakami, Makoto; Yamamoto, Kei; Taketomi, Yoshitaka","journal":"Inflamm Regen","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3d50623bac3bd61b8af9c6dc65fa73e6086e645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6284315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6284315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IIF","PLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various PLA","independent PLA","secreted PLA","unique non-PLA","perturbation of particular PLA","lipid metabolism","unique lipid metabolite","driven lipid pathways","distinct roles of sPLA","various forms of skin disease","key regulator of skin barrier function","bioactive lipid mediators","therapy of human skin diseases","cutaneous inflammation","subtypes","cutaneous pathophysiology","cutaneous homeostasis","translated studies","knockout studies","group IIF","quality of lipids","phospholipase PNPLA1","diagnosis","catalysis","essential components","membrane phospholipids","fatty acids","lysophospholipids","combination","novel opportunities","mobilization","insights","lymphoid immune cells","comprehensive lipidomics","IID","enzymes","IIE","epidermal hyperplasia","family","hair follicles","species differences","iPLA","knowledges","reaction","cellular membranes","patatin","review article","alterations","lipoquality","tissues"],"language":"en"},

This strategy yielded four mutated scFv sequences and a parental scFv that were used to produce five mouse\u2013human chimeric IgGs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, with yields of 33\u201372 mg/kg of plant tissue. Immunological analysis confirmed the specific binding of these plant-derived antibodies to T. gondii tachyzoites, and in vitro efficacy was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the invasion of human fibroblasts and impair parasite infectivity. These novel recombinant antibodies could therefore be suitable for the development of plant-derived immunotherapeutic interventions against toxoplasmosis.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Sherene Swee Yin; Chua, Kek Heng; N\u00F6lke, Greta; Spiegel, Holger; Goh, Wai Leong; Chow, Sek Chuen; Kee, Boon Pin; Fischer, Rainer; Schillberg, Stefan; Othman, Rofina Yasmin","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50fc9068ff3d31f1caf01c012e7c08b3ea99d985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6294049.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6294049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plant-derived antibodies","novel recombinant antibodies","parental scFv","gondii tachyzoites","parasite Toxoplasma gondii","development of plant","plant tissue","mutated scFv sequences","gondii tachyzoite-specific single-chain variable fragment","specific binding","resistant toxoplasmosis","therapeutic alternative","therapeutic impact","panel of affinity","affinity optimization","parasite infectivity","bioinformatic analysis","Immunological analysis","light chain complementarity","derived immunotherapeutic interventions","invasion of human fibroblasts","Current antiparasitic drugs","cause hypersensitivity","point mutations","Nicotiana benthamiana plants","effects","hotspots","opportunistic infection","phage display","immunocompromised patients","infants","recent emergence of drug","neonates","prolonged treatment","yields","ability","mouse","region","efficacy","strategy","effort"],"language":"en"},

In endemic regions, HEV-1 or HEV-2 genotypes are frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women, while with zoonotic HEV (HEV-3 and HEV-4), chronic cases of hepatitis and severe neurological disorders are reported. Hence, it is important to characterize the interactions between HEV and its host. Here, we investigated the ability of the nonstructural polyprotein encoded by the first open reading frame (ORF1) of HEV to modulate the host early antiviral response and, in particular, the type I interferon (IFN-I) system. We found that the amino-terminal region of HEV-3 ORF1 (MetYPCP), containing a putative methyltransferase (Met) and a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) functional domain, inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activation and the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to IFN-I. We showed that the MetYPCP domain interfered with the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription protein (STAT) signalling pathway by inhibiting STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation after IFN-I treatment. In contrast, MetYPCP had no effect on STAT2 phosphorylation and a limited impact on the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway after IFN-II stimulation. This inhibitory function seemed to be genotype-dependent, as MetYPCP from HEV-1 had no significant effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. Overall, this study provides evidence that the predicted MetYPCP domain of HEV ORF1 antagonises STAT1 activation to modulate the IFN response.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bagdassarian, Eug\u00E9nie; Doceul, Virginie; Pellerin, Marie; Demange, Antonin; Meyer, L\u00E9a; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Pavio, Nicole","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7ddb36588a83decb4c6bcd033f9a0b208e66973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV","JAK/STAT","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic HEV","IFN response","predicted MetYPCP domain of HEV ORF1","amino-terminal region of HEV","IFN-stimulated genes","inhibited IFN-stimulated response element","STAT pathway","JAK","STAT1 activation","fulminant hepatitis","antiviral response","functional domain","promoter activation","signalling pathway","chronic cases of hepatitis","Hepatitis E virus","host","large waterborne epidemics of hepatitis","endemic countries","STAT2 phosphorylation","significant effect","endemic regions","STAT1 nuclear translocation","emerging zoonotic pathogen","ISRE","transcription protein","signal transducer","activator","expression","Janus kinase","papain","cysteine protease","limited impact","pregnant women","ISGs","severe neurological disorders","open reading frame","interferon","evidence","nonstructural polyprotein","putative methyltransferase","study","interactions","genotypes","stimulation","ability","system","contrast","treatment","inhibitory function"],"language":"en"},

Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response. We hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans (GPC) are elevated in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Plasma GPC 1\u20136 levels were measured by ELISA in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening. Plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection. Patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure. To determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure, patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment. The association of plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation, disease severity, and glycocalyx shedding was investigated. RESULTS: In the pilot study, only GPC 1, 3, and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients. In the larger cohort, GPC 1, 3, and 4 levels were significantly higher (p \u003C 0.001) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure. GPC 1, 3, and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers C-reactive protein, lactate, procalcitonin, and heparin binding protein, and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1. They were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx-protective factors apolipoprotein M and sphingosine-1-phosphate. CONCLUSIONS: We show that GPC 1, 3, and 4 are elevated in plasma of patients with sepsis and correlate with markers of disease severity, systemic inflammation, and glycocalyx damage.

A limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens in Cameroon, and as in many other African countries, the cause of many diarrheal episodes remains unexplained. A proportion of these unknown cases of diarrhea are likely caused by yet-unidentified viral agents, some of which could be the result of (recent) interspecies transmission from animal reservoirs, like bats. Using viral metagenomics, we screened fecal samples of 221 humans (almost all with gastroenteritis symptoms) between 0 and 89 years of age with different degrees of bat contact. We identified viruses belonging to families that are known to cause gastroenteritis such as Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae. Interestingly, a mammalian orthoreovirus, picobirnaviruses, a smacovirus, and a pecovirus were also found. Although there was no evidence of interspecies transmission of the most common human gastroenteritis-related viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, and Reoviridae), the phylogenies of the identified orthoreovirus, picobirnavirus, and smacovirus indicate a genetic relatedness of these viruses identified in stools of humans and those of bats and/or other animals. These findings points out the possibility of interspecies transmission or simply a shared host of these viruses (bacterial, fungal, parasitic, \u2026) present in both animals (bats) and humans. Further screening of bat viruses in humans or vice versa will elucidate the epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses to human health. Furthermore, this study showed a huge diversity of highly divergent novel phages, thereby expanding the existing phageome considerably. IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of diagnostic tools for different enteric viral pathogens, a large fraction of human cases of gastroenteritis remains unexplained. This could be due to pathogens not tested for or novel divergent viruses of potential animal origin. Fecal virome analyses of Cameroonians showed a very diverse group of viruses, some of which are genetically related to those identified in animals. This is the first attempt to describe the gut virome of humans from Cameroon. Therefore, the data represent a baseline for future studies on enteric viral pathogens in this area and contribute to our knowledge of the world\u2019s virome. The studies also highlight the fact that more viruses may be associated with diarrhea than the typical known ones. Hence, it provides meaningful epidemiological information on diarrhea-related viruses in this area.","publish_time":"2019-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yinda, Claude Kwe; Vanhulle, Emiel; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Shi, Chenyan; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Maes, Piet; Van Ranst, Marc; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/311aaa859b69a54fba2d8a532fcf632599002edb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6344602.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["diarrhea-related viruses","common human gastroenteritis-related viruses","screening of bat viruses","diverse group of viruses","epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses","novel divergent viruses of potential animal origin","different enteric viral pathogens","stools of humans","gut virome of humans","bats","identified orthoreovirus","animals","prevalence of enteric pathogens","viral metagenomics","gastroenteritis symptoms","possibility of interspecies transmission","evidence of interspecies transmission","unknown cases of diarrhea","large fraction of human cases of gastroenteritis","human health","animal reservoirs","Astroviridae","smacovirus","future studies","Caliciviridae","unidentified viral agents","area","world\u2019s virome","Reoviridae","Fecal virome analyses of Cameroonians","divergent novel phages","limited number of studies","different degrees of bat contact","fecal samples","mammalian orthoreovirus","meaningful epidemiological information","common causes of deaths","typical known ones","availability of diagnostic tools","huge diversity","baseline","shared host","years of age","Picornaviridae","present","genetic relatedness","phylogenies","Adenoviridae","diarrheal episodes","IMPORTANCE","children","data","picobirnaviruses","knowledge","proportion","result","existing phageome","African countries","study","attempt","findings","fact","families","pecovirus"],"language":"en"},

The data collected in 18 adults and 2 liver transplanted pediatric patients were: clinical scores, monocyte expression of HLA-DR (flow cytometry), lymphocyte immune-phenotyping (flow cytometry), IL-6 and IL-10 plasma levels (ELISA), bacterial cultures, disease severity, and mortality. RESULTS: In 15 out of 18 patients IFN\u03B3 treatment was associated with an increase of median HLA-DR expression from 2666 [IQ 1547; 4991] to 12,451 [IQ 4166; 19,707], while the absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations were not affected, except for the decrease number of NK cells 94.5 [23; 136] to 32.5 [13; 90.8] (0.0625)]. Plasma levels of IL-6 464 [201\u2013770] to 108 (89\u2013140) ng/mL (p = 0.04) and IL-10 from IL-10 from 29 [12\u201359] to 9 [1\u201315] pg/mL decreased significantly. Three patients who received IFN\u03B3 early after ICU admission (\u003C4 days) died. The other patients had a rapid clinical improvement assessed by the SOFA score and bacterial cultures that were repeatedly positive became negative. The 2 pediatric cases improved rapidly, but 1 died for hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION: Guided by clinical and immunological monitoring, adjunctive immunotherapy with IFN\u03B3 appears well-tolerated in our cases and improves immune host defense in sepsis induced immuno suppression. Randomized clinical studies to assess its potential clinical benefit are warranted.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payen, Didier; Faivre, Valerie; Miatello, Jordi; Leentjens, Jenneke; Brumpt, Caren; Tissi\u00E8res, Pierre; Dupuis, Claire; Pickkers, Peter; Lukaszewicz, Anne Claire","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6833157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6833157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients IFN\u03B3 treatment","IFN\u03B3-treatment","clinical information","clinical scores","pediatric patients","pediatric sepsis patients","effects of IFN\u03B3","rapid clinical improvement","Randomized clinical studies","potential clinical benefit","Plasma levels of IL","days","immune response","onset of sepsis","pediatric cases","lymphocyte immune-phenotyping","adaptive immune cells","sepsis-induced immunodepression","impaired clinical outcomes of various stress conditions","immune host defense","flow cytometry","bacterial cultures","sepsis induced immuno suppression","IQ","monocyte expression of HLA","increase of median HLA-DR expression","immunological monitoring","immunological criteria","absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations","decrease number of NK cells","open-label prospective multi-center case-series","adjunctive immunotherapy","ELISA","SOFA score","attenuated function of innate","optimal timing","disease severity","adults","tolerance","cohort","liver","paramount relevance","ICU admission","mortality","effectiveness","BACKGROUND","interferon-gamma","pharmacological interventions","METHODS","CONCLUSION","hemorrhagic complication","syndrome","data","RESULTS","pg"],"language":"en"},

EHEC are associated with diarrhoea and dysentery in humans and in ruminants, mainly calves from two to eight weeks of age. Clinical signs and/or lesions have been reproduced experimentally with EHEC strains belonging to serotypes O5:K4/Nm, O26:K-:H11, O111:Nm, and O157:H7 which are isolated from cattle and/or humans. The purpose of this work was to develop an experimental model of infection in newborn calves with a bovine EHEC strain isolated from a calf which of died of diarrhoea, and belonging to the O118:H16 serotype, which is also common to both cattle and humans. The bovine O118:H16 EHEC strain was able to colonize the gut of three newborn calves, and to induce diarrhoea twenty-four hours after challenge and to produce AE lesions in the small and/or large intestines. AE lesions were detected microscopically and ultrastructurally in the small intestine of one calf and in the whole intestinal track of two calves. Internalization of bacteria and also of pedestal-bacteria complex inside of the enterocyte was observed in two of the three calves. The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. The challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves but not from other organs or from heart blood. No blood was observed in the faeces of any of the three calves, nor were any lesions in the internal organs, which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin whose role is still unknown in cattle.","publish_time":"2000-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stordeur, Philippe; China, Bernard; Charlier, Gerard; Roels, Stefan; Mainil, Jacques","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cbf0c99c7d0ea1b6418efc0037b46f21d205895.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129137.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457900002902; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457900002902","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["EHEC","AE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["newborn calves","AE lesions","bovine EHEC strain","H16 EHEC strain","EHEC strains","calf","diarrhoea","cattle","humans","challenge strain","bovine O118","Nm","pedestal-bacteria","Internalization of bacteria","H16 serotype","small intestine","internal organs","heart blood","enteropathogenic Escherichia coli","production of cytotoxins active","various cell cultures","serotypes O5","K4","experimental model of infection","enterohaemorrhagic","verocytotoxins","O26","role","effacing","gut","dysentery","mesenteric lymph nodes","Abstract Attaching","work","O111","O157","H11","verotoxin","H7","intestinal track","hours","shigacytotoxins","significance","stage","large intestines","ruminants","Clinical signs","invasion","faeces","weeks of age","purpose","enterocyte"],"language":"en"},

Both ectodomains are highly antigenic, carry neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes, and are involved in virus-mediated fusion activity. However, data have so far been biologically based, and derived solely from T cell line-adapted (TCLA), B clade viruses. Here we have carried out sequence and theoretically based structural analyses of 357 gp41 C-terminal sequences of mainly primary isolates of HIV-1 clades A, B, C, and D. Data show that all these viruses have the potential to form a tail loop structure (the minor ectodomain) supported by three, \u03B2-sheet, membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). This means that the first (N-terminal) tyrosine-based sorting signal of the gp41 tail is situated outside the cell membrane and is non-functional, and that gp41 that reaches the cell surface may be recycled back into the cytoplasm through the activity of the second tyrosine-sorting signal. However, we suggest that only a minority of cell-associated gp41 molecules \u2013 those destined for incorporation into virions \u2013 has 3 MSDs and the minor ectodomain. Most intracellular gp41 has the conventional single MSD, no minor ectodomain, a functional first tyrosine-based sorting signal, and in line with current thinking is degraded intracellularly. The gp41 structural diversity suggested here can be viewed as an evolutionary strategy to minimize HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein expression on the cell surface, and hence possible cytotoxicity and immune attack on the infected cell.","publish_time":"2005-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hollier, Mark J.; Dimmock, Nigel J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/253c5b15ac4288e8a239ae6c93b8f0d3a7baa6cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111842.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205002205; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205002205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["D.

The results are compared with docking studies and it was found that all the compounds resulted in decrease in energy while interacting with the active site of the enzyme.","publish_time":"2015-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raghav, Neera; Kaur, Ravinder","journal":"Int J Biol Macromol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0a96df67581a275464935ec9aa6d947c35eddf4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/13edbeba36da95e5a2853ec069ba6b1d16f71740.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124378.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813015005000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193682/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813015005000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.07.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cathepsin B","cathepsin H","cysteine protease inhibitors","chalconesemicarbazones","better inhibitors","best inhibitors","diarylpyrazolines","cathepsins B","versatile lysosomal cysteine proteases","substituted chalcones","synthesized compounds","synthesis","number of pathological conditions","tissue degenerative processes","systematic evaluation","preliminary screening","energy","intracellular protein degradation","results","active site","activity","enzyme","present work","docking studies","decrease"],"language":"en"},

Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade.

This study investigated 14 respiratory viruses in ARIs among children and associated meteorological factors in Shantou, southern China. METHODS: Paired nasal/throat-flocked swabs collected from 1,074 children with ARIs, who visited outpatient walk-in clinics in a tertiary hospital between December 2010 and November 2011, were examined for fourteen respiratory viruses - influenza viruses (FluA, FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV A and B), human coronaviruses (hCoV: 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV A and B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV A, B, C), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parechoviruses (hPeV) - by multiplex real-time PCR. RESULTS: We identified at least one virus in 82.3% (884/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074) of patients. EV and HRV were the most frequently detected single viruses (42.3%, 374/884 and 39.9%, 353/884 respectively) and co-detected pair (23.1%, 96/415). Overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for EV and single peaks for the others. By logistic regression analysis, EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hCoV, and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV. HRV was inversely associated with EV and PIV3. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports high viral detection and co-detection rates in pediatric ARI cases mainly due to EV and HRV. Many viruses circulated throughout the year with similar seasonal trends in association with temperature, humidity, and wind velocity. Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses. Understanding the polyviral etiology and viral interactions in the cases with multiple viruses warrants further studies.

In our well-differentiated cells, \u03B12,6-linked sialic acid is predominantly expressed on the apical surface and the basal cells mainly express \u03B12,3-linked sialic acid. During the whole infection period, release of infectious virus was maintained at a high titre for more than seven days. The infected epithelial cells were subject to apoptosis resulting in the loss of ciliated cells together with a thinner thickness. Nevertheless, the airway epithelium maintained trans-epithelial electrical resistance and retained its barrier function. The loss of ciliated cells was compensated by the cells which contained the KRT5 basal cell marker but were not yet differentiated into ciliated cells. These specialized cells showed an increase of \u03B12,3-linked sialic acid on the apical surface. In sum, our results help to explain the localized infection of the airway epithelium by influenza viruses. The impairment of mucociliary clearance in the epithelial cells provides an explanation why prior viral infection renders the host more susceptible to secondary co-infection by another pathogen.","publish_time":"2016-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Nai-Huei; Yang, Wei; Beineke, Andreas; Dijkman, Ronald; Matrosovich, Mikhail; Baumg\u00E4rtner, Wolfgang; Thiel, Volker; Valentin-Weigand, Peter; Meng, Fandan; Herrler, Georg","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02843e9be924677d6541e0221a26501ce2111aaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5177954.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep39668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["basal cells","specialized cells","infected epithelial cells","loss of ciliated cells","well-differentiated cells","porcine respiratory epithelial cells","infection period","localized infection","sialic acid","long term influenza virus infection","respiratory epithelium","airway epithelium","effect of virus","prior viral infection","Virus-host interactions","secondary co-infection","express \u03B12","release of infectious virus","increase of \u03B12","apical surface","trans-epithelial electrical resistance","influenza viruses","KRT5 basal cell marker","air-liquid interface culture system","apoptosis","explanation","impairment of mucociliary clearance","barrier function","high titre","cellular damage","results","pathogen","thinner thickness","days","sum"],"language":"en"},

FOXM1(362\u2010370) (YLVPIQFPV), FOXM1(373\u2010382) (SLVLQPSVKV), and FOXM1(640\u2010649) (GLMDLSTTPL) peptides primed HLA\u2010A2\u2010restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the HLA\u2010A2 transgenic mice. Human CTL lines reactive to these 3 peptides could also be established from HLA\u2010A2\u2010positive healthy donors and cancer patients. Natural processing of the 3 epitopes from FOXM1 protein was confirmed by specific killing of HLA\u2010A2\u2010positive FOXM1\u2010transfectants by peptide\u2010induced CTLs. FOXM1 is expressed in various types of cancers and it is also functionally involved in oncogenic transformation and the survival of cancer cells.

Objective: Based on death notification data from Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, this study assesses seasonal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by age groups and evaluates how these patterns changed over the period 1976\u20132015. Methods: Monthly numbers of deaths by cause were obtained from death registers maintained by the Municipal Hygiene Office in charge of verifying deaths before the issuance of burial permits. Generalized Additive Mixed regression models (GAMM) were used to test for seasonality in mortality and its changes over the last four decades, controlling for long-term trends in mortality. Results: Among children, risks of dying were the highest during the hot and rainy season, but seasonality in child mortality has significantly declined since the mid-1970s, as a result of declines in the burden of infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies. In adults aged 60 and above, all-cause mortality rates are the highest in the dry and cold season, due to peaks in cardiovascular diseases, with little change over time. Overall, changes in the seasonality of all-cause mortality have been driven by shifts in the hierarchy of causes of death, while changes in the seasonality within broad categories of causes of death have been modest. Conclusion: Shifts in disease patterns brought about by the epidemiological transition, rather than changes in seasonal variation in cause-specific mortality, are the main drivers of trends in the seasonality of all-cause mortality.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schl\u00FCter, Benjamin-Samuel; Masquelier, Bruno; Metcalf, C.

Beginning in the thymus and continuing into the periphery, these interactions, refined by accessory molecules, direct the expansion, differentiation, and function of T-cell subsets. The cellular context of T-cell engagement with antigen-presenting cells, either in lymphoid or nonlymphoid tissues, plays an important role in determining how these cells respond to antigen encounters. CD8(\u002B) T cells are essential for clearance of a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, but the virus can present a number of unique challenges that antiviral T cells must overcome. Peripheral LCMV infection can lead to rapid cytolytic clearance or chronic viral persistence; central nervous system infection can result in T-cell-dependent fatal meningitis or an asymptomatic carrier state amenable to immunotherapeutic clearance. These diverse outcomes all depend upon interactions that require TCR engagement of cognate peptide-MHC complexes. In this review, we explore the diversity in antiviral T-cell behaviors resulting from TCR engagement, beginning with an overview of the immunological synapse and progressing to regulators of TCR signaling that shape the delicate balance between immunopathology and viral clearance.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moseman, E.

Methods A retrospective study including 548 COVID-19 patients with clarified outcome (discharged or deceased) from a national cohort in China was performed. Cross-sectional and longitudinal variations were compared and the associations with different severity and outcomes were analyzed. Results On admission, the counts of lymphocytes, T cell subsets, eosinophils and platelets decreased markedly, especially in severe/critical and fatal patients. Increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or non-survivors. During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes and platelets were shown an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterwards in non-survivors. Non-survivors kept high level or showed an upward trend for neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein and C-reactive protein, which were kept stable or shown downward trend in survivors. Positive correlation between CD8\u002B T cell and lymphocytes count was found in survivors but not in non-survivors.

Objective To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China. Design, Setting, and Participants Collaborating with the National Health Commission of China, we established a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions as of January 31, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM). The score provides an estimate of the risk that a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 will develop critical illness. Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Data from 4 additional cohorts in China hospitalized with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. Data were analyzed between February 20, 2020 and March 17, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, critical illness was defined as the composite measure of admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death. Results The development cohort included 1590 patients. the mean (SD) age of patients in the cohort was 48.9 (15.7) years; 904 (57.3%) were men. The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%). From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24). The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient\u0027s risk of developing critical illness.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Wenhua; Liang, Hengrui; Ou, Limin; Chen, Binfeng; Chen, Ailan; Li, Caichen; Li, Yimin; Guan, Weijie; Sang, Ling; Lu, Jiatao; Xu, Yuanda; Chen, Guoqiang; Guo, Haiyan; Guo, Jun; Chen, Zisheng; Zhao, Yi; Li, Shiyue; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; He, Jianxing","journal":"JAMA internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396163/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["age of patients","predictive risk score","retrospective cohort of patients","critical illness","clinical score","COVID-GRAM","characteristics of COVID","development cohort","validation cohort","hospital admission","nationwide cohort","patient\u0027s risk","Importance Early identification of patients","mean AUC","online risk calculator","time of admission","composite measure of admission","SD","Data","years","imaging variables","National Health Commission of China","great importance","hospitalized patient","independent predictive factors","novel corona virus disease","intensive care unit","LASSO","logistic regression","Selection Operator","Absolute Shrinkage","Participants","invasive ventilation","receiver","characteristic curve","laboratory","hospitals","area","study","chest radiographic abnormality","additional cohorts","Measures","proper treatment","potential predictors","Main Outcomes","use of resources","provincial administrative regions","death","Relevance","estimate","neutrophil","lymphocyte ratio","Design","Setting","Conclusions","number of comorbidities","cancer history","lactate dehydrogenase","direct bilirubin","public","Objective","Accuracy","hemoptysis","dyspnea","unconsciousness"],"language":"en"}]}

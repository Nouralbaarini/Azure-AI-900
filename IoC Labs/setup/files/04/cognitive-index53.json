METHODS We conducted a proportion meta-analysis to integrate the results of previous studies identified in online databases, and subsequently compared the overlapping of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between locations of diagnosis. The heterogeneity of the results of the included studies was also demonstrated. RESULTS Nine studies with level IV evidence were considered to be eligible for the meta-analysis, and a comparative analysis was only possible between patients diagnosed in Wuhan and outside of Wuhan in China. Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients. When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed in Wuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%). The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present. Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs. These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside of Wuhan although further analysis is needed. The role of chest CT in COVID-19 diagnosis is inconclusive based on this study.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Joo-Hyun; Jang, Wook; Kim, Sang-Woo; Lee, Jeongjun; Lim, Yun-Sung; Cho, Chang-Gun; Park, Seok-Won; Kim, Bo Hae","journal":"Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2020.00570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","COVID","characteristics of patients","dyspnea","younger age of patients","CONCLUSION Fever","results of previous studies","chest CT findings","location of diagnosis","comparative analysis","locations of diagnosis","earlier diagnosis","clinical features","included studies","role of chest CT","proportion meta-analysis","findings of coronavirus disease","signs of respiratory infection","respiratory infection signs","study","common clinical manifestation","OBJECTIVES","chest computed tomography","areas of China","common symptom","significant differences","confidence intervals","CIs","evidence","online databases","overlapping","METHODS","level","groups","heterogeneity","screening programs"],"language":"en"},

Fifty-sixty percent of these patients died. The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease. Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration. In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.

Hypertension has been widely reported to be associated with increase disease severity, however, other studies have reported different findings. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association of hypertension and severe and fatal COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting the rate of hypertension in COVID-19 patients with severe or non-severe disease or among survivors and non-survivors. The obtained data was pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS Hypertension was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR: 2.49 [95%CI: 1.98-3.12] I2=24%), as well as with a similarly significant higher risk of mortality (OR: 2.42 [95%CI: 1.51-3.90] I2=0%). In meta-regression, a significant correlation was observed with an increase in mean age of patients with severe COVID-19 associated with increased log odds of hypertension and severity (p=0.03).

METHODS Adult male Wistar rats (120 \u00B1 10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-\u03BAB, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-\u03BAB, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shatoor, Abdullah S; Shati, Ali; Humayed, S Al; Al-Qahtani, Sultan; Alkhateeb, Mahmoud","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3187-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of P2Y12","aronia inhibited platelet aggregation","P-selectin","protein levels of P2Y12","downregulation of P2Y12","p-Akt","p-VASP","platelets P2Y12 receptors","platelets of rats","NF-\u03BAB","downregulation P2Y12 synthesis","platelets THXB2 release","intracellular cAMP levels","inhibited platelets level of ROS","mRNA expressions of P2Y12","major mechanisms","high dose","dual effects of Crataegus aronia","inhibition of ROS","molecular alterations","low dose","nuclear factor \u03BAB","treated rats","concentration","multiple interconnected mechanisms","induced activation of NF","aqueous extract","molecular experiments","THXA2 synthesis","opposite direction","Opposite findings","METHODS Adult male Wistar rats","co-administration of N","CONCLUSION Oral administration of","intracellular reactive oxygen species","content","thromboxane B2","cyclic adenosine monophosphate","inflammatory markers","acetylcysteine","days","phosphorylated vasodilator","Western blot","real-time polymerase chain reaction","phosphoprotein","function","pathway","treatments","control","vehicle","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel \u002B acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix\u00AE (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). CONCLUSION Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations.

Though molecular diagnostic tests are the gold standard for COVID-19, serological testing is emerging as a potential surveillance tool, in addition to its complementary role in COVID-19 diagnostics. Indubitably quantitative serological testing provides greater advantages than qualitative tests but today there is still little known about serological diagnostics and what the most appropriate role quantitative tests might play. METHODS Sixty-one COVID-19 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG. All COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR result. RESULTS The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer\u0027s cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes. The ROC performance curves showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively.

This study aimed to predict the development of the epidemic with specific interventional policies applied in China and evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS COVID-19 data of Hubei Province and the next five most affected provinces were collected from daily case reports of COVID-19 on the Health Committee official website of these provinces. The number of current cases, defined as the number of confirmed cases minus the number of cured cases and those who have died, was examined in this study. A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious- Removed (SEIR) model was used to assess the effects of interventional policies on the epidemic. In this study, January 28 was day zero of the model. RESULTS The results of the modified SEIR model showed that the number of current cases in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces tended to be stabilized after 70 days and after 60 days in the four other provinces. The predicted number of current cases without policy intervention was shown to far exceed that with policy intervention. The estimated number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province with policy intervention was predicted to peak at 51,222, whereas that without policy intervention was predicted to reach 157,721. CONCLUSION Based on the results of the model, strong interventional policies were found to be vital components of epidemic control. Applying such policies is likely to shorten the duration of the epidemic and reduce the number of new cases. This article is protected by copyright.

The fusion peptide alters the membrane organization and dynamics of the host membrane to facilitate membrane fusion. Generally, the effect of fusion peptide on the membrane is sensitive to the lipid composition of target membranes. In this present work, we have utilized steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in tandem with circular dichroism spectroscopy to elucidate the binding, oligomeric status, secondary structure of the fusion peptide and its impact on the depth-dependent membrane organization and dynamics. We have used depth-dependent fluorescence probes, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and its trimethylammonium derivative (TMA-DPH), to evaluate the effect of the peptide-binding along the bilayer normal. We have exploited the energy transfer efficiency of tryptophan between TMA-DPH and DPH to determine the relative location of the solitary tryptophan present in the membrane-bound fusion peptide. We have further evaluated the effect of membrane cholesterol on the binding and organization of the peptide and the impact of peptide binding on the depth-dependent physical properties of the membrane at various cholesterol concentrations. Our results clearly demonstrate that the membrane cholesterol alters the oligomeric status of the membrane-bound peptide and the effect of peptide-binding on the depth-dependent membrane organization and dynamics. The role of cholesterol is important as the eukaryotic host cells contain good amount of cholesterol that might be important for the entry of pathogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meher, Geetanjali; Bhattacharjya, Surajit; Chakraborty, Hirak","journal":"The journal of physical chemistry.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described. METHODS Adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (\u2265 5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n=70), severe patients (n=195) and critical patients (n=43). Laboratory data, demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity. RESULTS Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment. Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads. The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (p=0.026). The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (p\u003C0.001). The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets, and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system. CONCLUSIONS The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jing-Tao; Ran, Ruo-Xi; Lv, Zhi-Hua; Feng, Li-Na; Ran, Chen-Yang; Tong, Yong-Qing; Li, Dong; Su, Han-Wen; Zhu, Cheng-Liang; Qiu, Shi-Li; Yang, Jie; Xiao, Meng-Yao; Liu, Ming-Jun; Yang, Yu-Ting; Liu, Song-Mei; Li, Yan","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serial viral loads of patients","highest viral loads","lowest viral loads","viral shedding","general patients","severe patients","critical patients","RESULTS Viral load of SARS","clinical characteristics of patients","SARS-CoV","COVID","Laboratory data","clinical data","days","treatment","laboratory features of cardiovascular system","gastrointestinal tract samples","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","positive rate of respiratory tract samples","pharyngeal swabs","early warning of illness severity","coronavirus disease","resurgence of virus","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","nucleic acid tests","sputum","portion parameters of blood routine","times","hospitalization","association","contrast","lymphocyte subsets","years old","relationships","METHODS Adult inpatients","CONCLUSIONS","electronic medical records","antiviral interventions","fitted polynomial curve","admission","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdullaev, Serazhutdin; Bulanova, Tatiana; Timoshenko, Gennady; Gaziev, Azhub I","journal":"Molecular biology reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05491-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain tumor","levels of mtDNA mutant copies","mtDNA copy numbers","levels of mtDNA copy number","normal brain tissues","different brain regions","rat brain regions","level of mtDNA heteroplasmy","increase","MeV protons","hippocampus","harmful effects of protons","mitochondrial dysfunction","head exposure","tumor site","total mitochondrial DNA","Proton beam therapy","months old male Spraque Dawley rats","oxidative stress","development of neurodegenerative diseases","possible damage","cortex","exploration","cerebellum","limitations","doses","Surveyor nuclease technology","induction of carcinogenesis","real-time PCR","use","changes","irradiation","conclusion","efficacy of treatment","context","significant elevation","group","results","study"],"language":"en"},

In this framework, the aim of the present review was to summarize the results on the application of functional compounds from olive pomace in food products. Phenolics-rich extracts from olive pomace were added to vegetable oils, fish burgers, fermented milk and in the edible coating of fruit, in order to take advantage of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, olive pomace was directly used in the formulation of pasta and baked goods, by exploiting polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber to obtain high-value added healthy foods and/or to extend their shelf-life. With the same scope, olive pomace was also added to animal feeds obtaining healthy-improved animal products. Furthermore, different authors used olive pomace to produce biodegradable materials and/or active packaging able to increase the content of bioactive compounds and the oxidative stability of foods. Overall, the results highlighted in most cases the effectiveness of the addition of olive pomace-derived functional compounds in improving the nutritional value, the quality and/or the shelf-life of foods. However, more challenging was found to be the direct addition of olive pomace, especially due to alterations of sensory and textural features of food. This article is protected by copyright.

As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourget-Murray, Jonathan; Heard, Bryan J; Bansal, Rohit; Johnson, Andrew S; Powell, James","journal":"Canadian journal of surgery.

Covid-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, abbreviated hereafter to ACE2, MERS-CoV utilises dipeptidyl peptidase 4, abbreviated hereafter to DPP4, and recent modelling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in Covid-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of Covid-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of Covid-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilised to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.

Within primary care, health workers often use mobile devices to register clients, track their health, and make decisions about care, as well as to communicate with clients and other health workers. An understanding of how health workers relate to, and experience mHealth, can help in its implementation. OBJECTIVES To synthesise qualitative research evidence on health workers\u0027 perceptions and experiences of using mHealth technologies to deliver primary healthcare services, and to develop hypotheses about why some technologies are more effective than others. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index in January 2018. We searched Global Health in December 2015. We screened the reference lists of included studies and key references and searched seven sources for grey literature (16 February to 5 March 2018). We re-ran the search strategies in February 2020. We screened these records and any studies that we identified as potentially relevant are awaiting classification. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that used qualitative data collection and analysis methods. We included studies of mHealth programmes that were part of primary healthcare services. These services could be implemented in public or private primary healthcare facilities, community and workplace, or the homes of clients. We included all categories of health workers, as well as those persons who supported the delivery and management of the mHealth programmes. We excluded participants identified as technical staff who developed and maintained the mHealth technology, without otherwise being involved in the programme delivery. We included studies conducted in any country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We assessed abstracts, titles and full-text papers according to the inclusion criteria. We found 53 studies that met the inclusion criteria and sampled 43 of these for our analysis. For the 43 sampled studies, we extracted information, such as country, health worker category, and the mHealth technology. We used a thematic analysis process. We used GRADE-CERQual to assess our confidence in the findings. MAIN RESULTS Most of the 43 included sample studies were from low- or middle-income countries. In many of the studies, the mobile devices had decision support software loaded onto them, which showed the steps the health workers had to follow when they provided health care. Other uses included in-person and/or text message communication, and recording clients\u0027 health information. Almost half of the studies looked at health workers\u0027 use of mobile devices for mother, child, and newborn health. We have moderate or high confidence in the following findings. mHealth changed how health workers worked with each other: health workers appreciated being more connected to colleagues, and thought that this improved co-ordination and quality of care. However, some described problems when senior colleagues did not respond or responded in anger. Some preferred face-to-face connection with colleagues. Some believed that mHealth improved their reporting, while others compared it to \u0022big brother watching\u0022. mHealth changed how health workers delivered care: health workers appreciated how mHealth let them take on new tasks, work flexibly, and reach clients in difficult-to-reach areas. They appreciated mHealth when it improved feedback, speed and workflow, but not when it was slow or time consuming. Some health workers found decision support software useful; others thought it threatened their clinical skills. Most health workers saw mHealth as better than paper, but some preferred paper. Some health workers saw mHealth as creating more work. mHealth led to new forms of engagement and relationships with clients and communities: health workers felt that communicating with clients by mobile phone improved care and their relationships with clients, but felt that some clients needed face-to-face contact. Health workers were aware of the importance of protecting confidential client information when using mobile devices. Some health workers did not mind being contacted by clients outside working hours, while others wanted boundaries. Health workers described how some community members trusted health workers that used mHealth while others were sceptical. Health workers pointed to problems when clients needed to own their own phones. Health workers\u0027 use and perceptions of mHealth could be influenced by factors tied to costs, the health worker, the technology, the health system and society, poor network access, and poor access to electricity: some health workers did not mind covering extra costs. Others complained that phone credit was not delivered on time. Health workers who were accustomed to using mobile phones were sometimes more positive towards mHealth. Others with less experience, were sometimes embarrassed about making mistakes in front of clients or worried about job security. Health workers wanted training, technical support, user-friendly devices, and systems that were integrated into existing electronic health systems. The main challenges health workers experienced were poor network connections, access to electricity, and the cost of recharging phones. Other problems included damaged phones. Factors outside the health system also influenced how health workers experienced mHealth, including language, gender, and poverty issues. Health workers felt that their commitment to clients helped them cope with these challenges. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Our findings propose a nuanced view about mHealth programmes. The complexities of healthcare delivery and human interactions defy simplistic conclusions on how health workers will perceive and experience their use of mHealth. Perceptions reflect the interplay between the technology, contexts, and human attributes. Detailed descriptions of the programme, implementation processes and contexts, alongside effectiveness studies, will help to unravel this interplay to formulate hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of mHealth.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odendaal, Willem A; Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Leon, Natalie; Goudge, Jane; Griffiths, Frances; Tomlinson, Mark; Daniels, Karen","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011942.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32216074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care","categories of health workers","newborn health","Global Health","BACKGROUND Mobile health","studies of mHealth programmes","health workers\u0027 perceptions","clients\u0027 health information","mHealth technologies","mHealth technology","health worker category","experience mHealth","health workers\u0027 use of mobile devices","sampled studies","included sample studies","reference lists of included studies","primary care","primary healthcare services","mobile phones","quality of care","analysis methods","private primary healthcare facilities","healthcare practices","inclusion criteria","homes of clients","qualitative data collection","senior colleagues","SEARCH METHODS","improved feedback","improved co-ordination","preferred paper","SELECTION CRITERIA","country","thematic analysis process","decision support software useful","Science Citation Index","Social Sciences Citation Index","text papers","high confidence","following findings","search strategies","programme delivery","qualitative research evidence","text message communication","preferred face-to-face connection","Embase","mother","CINAHL","community","key references","workplace","experiences","MEDLINE","abstracts","child","sources","titles","speed","management","OBJECTIVES","described problems","workflow","persons","hypotheses","grey literature","middle-income countries","technical staff","MAIN RESULTS","time consuming","participants","GRADE-CERQual","tablets","new tasks","decisions","half","understanding","steps","big brother","clinical skills","areas","classification","uses","records","implementation","reporting","anger","health workers experienced mHealth","main challenges health workers","clients","Health workers\u0027 use","existing electronic health systems","effectiveness of mHealth","perceptions of mHealth","use of mHealth","mHealth programmes","poor access","poor network access","mobile devices","damaged phones","poor network connections","relationships","electricity","technology","contexts","cost of recharging phones","interplay","problems","factors","mind","mobile phone improved care","simplistic conclusions","human interactions","user-friendly devices","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","human attributes","effectiveness studies","phone credit","extra costs","language","technical support","implementation processes","importance","training","society","nuanced view","confidential client information","complexities of healthcare delivery","community members","gender","findings","new forms of engagement","communities","Detailed descriptions","working hours","poverty issues","job security","commitment","boundaries","time","face-to-face contact","mistakes"],"language":"en"},

This has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions. Anatomy faces some unique challenges. Intrinsically, anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures, often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material, models and virtual resources. This study sought to identify the approaches taken in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means. Data were collected from 14 different universities in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach. Once themes were generated, they were collectively brought together using a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis. Key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations. Academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure. Comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand. Discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Longhurst, Georga J; Stone, Danya M; Dulohery, Kate; Scully, Deirdre; Campbell, Thomas; Smith, Claire F","journal":"Anatomical sciences education","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United Kingdom","Republic of Ireland"],"keyphrases":["multiple higher education institutions","anatomical education","Anatomy","new online resources","virtual resources","opportunity","Republic of Ireland","United Kingdom","cadaveric exposure","Academics","study of human cadaveric material","face teaching","online means","lack of exposure","Key themes","new academic collaborations","thematic analysis approach","models","globe","chance","distance learning","curriculum","social distancing measures","threat","actions","ways","different universities","immediate switch","fastest changes","sound","weakness","SWOT","decisions","assessment methods","pandemic","structures","time","strength","three-dimensional subject","quality","approaches","cases","relationships","Data","Comparisons","unique challenges","effectiveness","aim","Covid","Discussions","demand"],"language":"en"},

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, several non-COVID-19 medical emergencies still need to be treated, including vertebral fractures and spinal cord compression. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience and an organizational protocol for emergency spinal surgery currently being used in a large metropolitan area by an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. METHODS An organizational model is presented based on case centralization in hub hospitals and early management of surgical cases to reduce hospital stay. Data from all the patients admitted for emergency spinal surgery from the beginning of the outbreak were prospectively collected and compared to data from patients admitted for the same reason in the same time span in the previous year, and treated by the same integrated team. RESULTS A total of 19 patients (11 males and eight females, with a mean age of 49.9 years (14 to 83)) were admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression in a 19-day period, compared to the ten admitted in the previous year. No COVID-19 patients were treated. The mean time between admission and surgery was 1.7 days, significantly lower than 6.8 days the previous year (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available. We hope that our early experience can be of value to the medical communities that will soon be in the same emergency situation.

In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khosravani, Houman; Rajendram, Phavalan; Notario, Lowyl; Chapman, Martin G; Menon, Bijoy K","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.029838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["termed code stroke","protected code stroke algorithm","clinical team","conventional code stroke processes","effective stroke care","protected designation","clinical status","clinical screening criteria","clinical scenario","management of patients","key considerations","healthcare team","required nuanced considerations","efficacious care","precode screening","pandemic","case of COVID","aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation","specifics of personal protective equipment","primary infectious symptoms","neurological symptoms","focused framework","examination features","specific infection prevention","risk of infectious exposure","human performance factors","control recommendations","ability","maximal functional recovery","expert consensus","Purpose- Hyperacute assessment","time-sensitive","regard","current Coronavirus Disease","admission","prenotification","concept","Results","SARS-CoV","Methods- Available resources","context","Background","alternative diagnosis","suggested algorithms","local practice","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analysis from 2310 viral isolates from Nexstrain reveals that residue at 614 of the viral spike protein is changed from a putative ancestral aspartic acid (D) to a glycine (G) between two viral clades. The G strain is predominantly on the East Coast of the United States, and the D strain is predominantly on the West Coast. This mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein spike is conserved in coronaviruses. Point mutations in a murine coronavirus spike protein can result in increased virulence through instability of the viral machinery and altered viral to cell membrane fusion. This observation may partially explain the discrepancy in predicted deaths from COVID-19 between the East Coast and West Coast, and possibly explain that other factors aside from social distance, such as competition between two strains of differing virulence, may be at play.

The mortality rate of SFTS was 32.6% among 172 cases reported from 2012 to 2015 in South Korea. Thus, is necessary to develop an effective diagnostic method that selectively identifies the isolates circulating in South Korea.

A better strategy to attain desired cells may be in vitro commitment of hADMSCs to uni-/bi- potent neural progenitor cells (NPCs), prior to transplantation. Derivation of stable NPCs may require a suitable niche eliciting proliferation and differentiation signals. The present study designed a biomimetic niche comprising insoluble fibrin supported adhesion matrix and exogenously added growth factors (GFs) for deriving different neural cells and established the role of Notch and Wnt signals for proliferation and differentiation of hADMSCs, respectively. The stable transformation of hADMSCs into neurospheres (NS) comprising Nestin\u002Bve NPCs was achieved consistently. Slight modifications of niche enable differentiation of NS to NPCs; NPCs to neurons; NPCs to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); and OPCs to oligodendrocytes (OLG). Fibrin plays a crucial role in the conversion of hADMSC to NS and NPCs to OPCs; but, not essential for OPC to OLG maturation. Co-survival and cell-cell interaction of NPC derived neurons and OPCs promoting OLG maturation is illustrated. The designed biomimetic niche shows the potential for directing autologous ADMSCs to neural cells for applications in regenerative medicine.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandrababu, Krishnapriya; Senan, Manesh; Krishnan, Lissy K","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63445-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC","OPC","NPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["desired cells","undesirable cells","OPCs","ve NPCs","different neural cells","differentiation of NS","differentiation of hADMSCs","oligodendrocyte progenitor cells","Derivation of stable NPCs","differentiation signals","bi- potent neural progenitor cells","designed biomimetic niche","OLG maturation","Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells","multi-differentiation potential","suitable niche eliciting proliferation","Slight modifications of niche","commitment of hADMSCs","stable transformation of hADMSCs","cell-cell interaction of NPC derived neurons","conversion of hADMSC","Wnt signals","role of Notch","crucial role","insoluble fibrin","post-transplantation","adhesion matrix","central nervous system","applications","autologous ADMSCs","uni","GFs","neurospheres","growth factors","CNS","regeneration","Co-survival","regenerative medicine","Nestin","present study","better strategy","oligodendrocytes","Multipotency of MSC"],"language":"en"},

These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals\u2019 weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corradini, Isabella","journal":"Building a Cybersecurity Culture in Organizations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7652287f725fcb76b04e86eaafb227aec6ef525f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189027.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189027/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Artificial Intelligence"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cybersecurity problems","social engineering attacks","preferred cybersecurity strategy","multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity","current approach","human nature","human control","technological solutions","different elements","current scenario","different perspectives","new threats","starting point","critical issues","critical thinking","psychological point of view","powerful means","future perspective","company","information","brilliant results","forms of attack","miracle solution","alternatives","disciplines","effective antidote","key roles","individuals\u2019 weaknesses","management","Appropriate training of employees","technologies","phishing email","opportunity","existing ones","literature","cyberthreats","years","Artificial Intelligence","technology","radical change","mechanisms of persuasion"],"language":"en"},

Effective control of breathing ensures that the airway is protected, maintains volume homeostasis, and provides ventilation. Upper airway structures are effectors for all of these functions that affect the entire airway. Nasal functions include air conditioning and protective reflexes that can be exaggerated and involve circulatory changes. Oral cavity and pharyngeal patency enable airflow and feeding, but during sleep pharyngeal closure can result in apnea. Coordination of breathing with sucking and nutritive swallowing alters during development, while nonnutritive swallowing at all ages limits aspiration. Laryngeal functions in breathing include protection of the subglottic airway, active maintenance of its absolute volume, and control of tidal flow patterns. These are vital functions for normal lung growth in fetal life and during rapid adaptations to breathing challenges from birth through adulthood. Active central control of breathing focuses on the coordination of laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities, which adapts according to the integration of central and peripheral inputs. For the intensivist, knowledge of upper airway physiology can be applied to improve respiratory support. In a second part the mechanical properties of the respiratory system as a critical component of the chain of events that result in translation of the output of the respiratory rhythm generator to ventilation are described. A comprehensive understanding of respiratory mechanics is essential to the delivery of optimized and individualized mechanical ventilation. The basic elements of respiratory mechanics will be described and developmental changes in the airways, lungs, and chest wall that impact on measurement of respiratory mechanics with advancing postnatal age are reviewed. This will be follwowed by two sections, the first on respiratory mechanics in various neonatal pathologies and the second in pediatric pathologies. The latter can be classified in three categories. First, restrictive diseases may be of pulmonary origin, such as chronic interstitial lung diseases or acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are usually associated with reduced lung compliance. Restrictive diseases may also be due to chest wall abnormalities such as obesity or scoliosis (idiopathic or secondary to neuromuscular diseases), which are associated with a reduction in chest wall compliance. Second, obstructive diseases are represented by asthma and wheezing disorders, cystic fibrosis, long term sequelae of neonatal lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Obstructive diseases are defined by a reduced FEV1/VC ratio. Third, neuromuscular diseases, mainly represented by DMD and SMA, are associated with a decrease in vital capacity linked to respiratory muscle weakness that is better detected by PImax, PEmax and SNIP measurements.","publish_time":"2013-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutchison, Alastair A.; Leclerc, Francis; N\u00E8ve, V\u00E9ronique; Pillow, J.

This library contains information on band sizes generated by restriction digestion of the ribosomal RNA\u2010encoding DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region consisting of the 5.8 rRNA gene and two flanking regions (ITS1 and ITS2) with the endonucleases CfoI, HaeIII, HinfI and includes strains from 39 non\u2010Saccharomyces yeast species as well as for brewing and non\u2010brewing strains of Saccharomyces. The efficacy of the technique was assessed by isolation of 59 wild yeasts from industrial fermentation vessels and conditioning tanks and by matching their ITS amplicon sizes and RFLP profiles with those of the constructed library. Five separate, non\u2010introduced yeast taxa were putatively identified. These included Pichia species, which were associated with conditioning tanks and Saccharomyces species isolated from fermentation vessels. Strains of the lager yeast S. pastorianus could be reliably identified as belonging to either the Saaz or Frohberg hybrid group by restriction digestion of the ITS amplicon with the enzyme HaeIII.

In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barbosa, Raquel de M.; Fernandes, Marcelo A.C.","journal":"Data Brief","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa66e803e25ed899ee31602fb1a9dae56b6546f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus nucleotide sequences","instances of SARS","nucleotide sequences string","Virus-Host DB dataset","instances of Riboviria viruses","SARS-CoV","bat-SL","CGR","numerical values representation","chaos game representation","digital signal processing","data stream","Betacoronavirus RaTG13","NCBI","approaches","machine learning techniques","CoVZC45","analysis","crucial points","deaths","novel coronavirus disease","COVID","algorithms","bioinformatics area","regions","confirmed cases","CoVZXC21","countries"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we study the portfolio optimization problem in the Vietnamese stock market by using deep-learning methodologies and one dataset collected from the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (VN-HOSE) from the beginning of the year 2013 to the middle of the year 2019. We aim to construct an efficient algorithm that can find the portfolio having the highest Sharpe ratio in the next coming weeks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel loss function and transform the original problem into a supervised problem. The input data can be determined as a 3D tensor, while the predicted output is the unnormalized weighted proportion for each ticker in the portfolio to maximize the daily return Y of the stock market after a given number of days. We compare different deep learning models, including Residual Networks (ResNet), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Self-Attention (SA), Additive Attention (AA), and various combinations: SA \u002B LSTM, SA \u002B GRU, AA \u002B LSTM, and AA \u002B GRU. The experimental results show that the AA \u002B GRU outperforms the rest of the methods on the Sharpe ratio and provides promising results for the portfolio optimization problem not only in Vietnam but also in other countries.

To address this difficulty, we consider utilizing the underlying correlation in the data resource itself to derive different kinds of supervision signals and reduce the influence of noisy data.

The main task (i.e., our focus) selects the correct response given the last utterance and context, and the complementary task selects the last utterance given the response and context. The key point is that the output of the complementary task is used to set instance weights for the main task.

Yet, existing methods either partially leverage such context information or combine different types of contexts using a global weighting scheme, failing to capture the phenomenon that the importance of each context is also context-dependent rather than the same for all recommendation. In this paper, we propose a model to exploit spatial-temporal contexts in a POI-guided attention mechanism for POI recommendation. Such an attention mechanism offers us high flexibility to capture the POI-specific importance of each context. Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla demonstrate that the POI-specific context importance significantly improves the performance of POI recommendation.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hao; Shen, Huawei; Cheng, Xueqi","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c781c09438efec665f46d9d9295cfccc6aca16db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206255.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["performance of POI recommendation","POI-specific context importance","POI-specific importance","context-dependent","context information","POI-guided attention mechanism","traditional item recommendation","POIs","different types of contexts","dinner time","time-sensitivity","spatial-temporal contexts","fundamental task","real-world datasets","dependency","location","Gowalla","global weighting scheme","high flexibility","user\u2019s check-in sequence","model","restaurants","social networks","Experimental results","users","geographical influence","phenomenon","existing methods","paper","trip","Point"],"language":"en"},

As to graph data, however, it\u2019s not trivial to decide which nodes to retain in order to represent the high-level structure of a graph. Recently many different graph pooling methods have been proposed. However, they all rely on local features to conduct global pooling over all nodes, which contradicts poolings in CNNs that only use local features to conduct local pooling. We analyze why this may hinder the performance of graph pooling, then propose a novel graph pooling method called Bottom-Up and Top-Down graph POOLing (BUTDPool). BUTDPool aims to learn a more fine-grained pooling criterion based on coarse global structure information produced by a bottom-up pooling layer, and can enhance local features with global features. Specifically, we propose to use one or multiple pooling layers with a relatively high retain ratio to produce a coarse high-level graph. Injecting the high-level information back into low-level representation, BUTDPool enhances learning a better pooling criterion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over compared methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jia-Qi; Zhan, De-Chuan; Li, Xin-Chun","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9603106f3cb74abfa662b4c511a552126a4a8e03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BUTDPool"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local pooling","global pooling","performance of graph pooling","novel graph pooling method","different graph pooling methods","fine-grained pooling criterion","better pooling criterion","multiple pooling layers","local features","coarse high-level graph","graph data","global features","BUTDPool","high-level information","high-level structure","coarse global structure information","nodes","proposed method","efficient deep representation learning","low-level representation","superior performance","crucial components","ratio","CNNs","poolings","order","Experiments"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, a novel integration method called AutoSUM is proposed for automatic feature extraction and multi-user preference simulation to overcome the drawbacks of previous methods. There are two modules in AutoSUM: extractor and simulator. The extractor module operates automatic feature extraction based on a BiLSTM with a combined input representation including word embeddings and graph embeddings. Meanwhile, the simulator module automates multi-user preference simulation based on a well-designed two-phase attention mechanism (i.e., entity-phase attention and user-phase attention).

As a result, the low-score anomalies could be ranked lower than some normal points. This revelation motivates (i) a new score called Neighbourhood Contrast (NC) which produces approximately the same high scores for all anomalies, regardless of varying curvatures of the density surface in different regions; and (ii) an anomaly detection method based on NC. Our experiments show that the proposed method which employs the new score significantly outperforms methods using the aforementioned relative scores on benchmark datasets.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Bo; Ting, Kai Ming; Chin, Tat-Jun","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/828d6e8801b0f0866377d73ad62ac9840ff8dcfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Neighbourhood Contrast"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different relative scores","aforementioned relative scores","better scores","global scores","high scores","different regions","low-score anomalies","new score","density surface","varying curvatures","proposed method","anomaly detection method","Local Outlying Factor","key shortcoming","methods","mass ratio","Neighbourhood Contrast","benchmark datasets","result","time","analysis","normal points","experiments","revelation"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a cost effective break mitigation technique such as a failure forecasting model that allows one to predict the water mains failure likelihood, would reduce the negative social impact and the cost to serve. We introduce a semiparametric Bayesian model for pipeline failure forecasting. The model is centred on a nonparametric Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and uses a parametric survival model to capture the long-term survival probability using domain knowledge. The parametric element in our model allows the inclusion of survival probability, while the nonparametric part allows us to handle covariates and to employ incomplete prior knowledge about pipe failures. We apply our model to the proactive maintenance problem using a real dataset from a water utility in Australia. The results demonstrate that, our model performs better than competing models such as Support Vector Regression, Poisson regression, Weibull, Gradient Boosting, and GPR, leading to substantial savings on reactive repairs and maintenance. Our water pipeline failure prediction models have been deployed in three states across Australia, and are being monitored by each water authority.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weeraddana, Dilusha; Hapuarachchi, Harini; Kumarapperuma, Lakshitha; Khoa, Nguyen Lu Dang; Cai, Chen","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e57b9c4f2307031131e0b4ab9f65bfecc77c47a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["failure forecasting model","parametric survival model","water mains failure likelihood","water utility","water authority","renewal of water mains","water pipeline failure prediction models","semiparametric Bayesian model","pipeline failure forecasting","Poisson regression","GPR","long-term survival probability","inclusion of survival probability","Australia","nonparametric Gaussian Process Regression","Support Vector Regression","proactive maintenance problem","substantial savings","domain knowledge","parametric element","substantial financial investments","incomplete prior knowledge","cost effective break mitigation technique","Weibull","real dataset","direct inspection","Gradient Boosting","pipe failures","negative social impact","covariates","reactive repairs","distribution system","states","results"],"language":"en"},

Owing to their success in computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) or U-Net based models have often been employed in many recent studies for automatic tumor segmentation to learn numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels and extract various semantic features. However, the correlation between different tumor regions in feature maps cannot be easily captured due to the lack of contextual dependencies, which in turn limits the representative capability of the adopted models and thus affects the accuracy of tumor segmentation results. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework for segmentation of tumors in liver CT scans, which can explicitly extract multi-scale fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies. The proposed multi-scale framework features a light model with a very few additional parameters, and also its visualization capability significantly boosts networks\u2019 interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world liver tumor CT dataset illustrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of a number of widely used evaluation criteria for the hepatic tumor segmentation task.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pang, Shuchao; Du, Anan; Yu, Zhenmei; Orgun, Mehmet A.","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0d88326cb774b87525a111d640c88aef1403058.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Automatic tumor segmentation","segmentation of tumors","accuracy of tumor segmentation results","hepatic tumor segmentation task","real-world liver tumor CT dataset","liver CT scans","different tumor regions","proposed framework","proposed multi-scale framework","novel framework","local features","various semantic features","lack of contextual dependencies","multi-scale fine-grained contextual information","Convolutional Networks","state-of-the-art performance","visualization capability","representative capability","Experimental results","adopted models","global dependencies","numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels","light model","evaluation criteria","number","computer vision tasks","FCNs","identification of diseases","feature maps","additional parameters","U-Net","correlation","terms","turn","recent studies","diagnostic aid","success","networks\u2019 interpretability","treatment","issue"],"language":"en"},

Studies with bacteriophages in their prokaryotic host cells in the 1940s and 1950s provided the first insights into the complexities of viral replication. With the development of mammalian cell culture procedures, the techniques used for the study of bacteriophages were adapted to animal viruses. Progress has been such that the basic mechanisms of transcription, translation, and nucleic acid replication have been characterized for all the major families of animal viruses and the strategy of gene expression and its regulation clarified. Many important biochemical phenomena such as the splicing and other types of posttranscriptional processing of RNA, the posttranslational cleavage and glycosylation of proteins, the replication of RNA, reverse transcription, integration, and the transposition of viral genes and cellular oncogenes were first elucidated by virologists and have general application in cell biology.

The scientific basis for prevention and treatment of virus diseases are also explained. Virus infection is a complex, multistage interaction between the virus and the host organism. The patterns of virus infection can be divided into these types: abortive, acute, chronic, pertinent, and latent. The course and eventual outcome of any infection are the results of a balance between host and virus processes. The host factors involved include exposure to different routes of virus transmission and the control of virus replication by the immune response. Virus processes include the initial infection of the host, its spread throughout the host, and the regulation of gene expression to evade the immune response. The chapter also discusses the virus infections of plants, immune responses to virus infections in animals, apoptosis (programmed cell death), interferons (the blocking of virus infection), and evasion of immune responses. Medical intervention against virus infections includes the use of vaccines to stimulate the immune response and drugs to inhibit virus replication.

Several of these enzymes are common components of replication complexes of other plus-strand RNA viruses, such as picornavirus 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and ribose 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activities, while others such as exoribonuclease, endoribonuclease, and adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2033-phosphatase activities, are rarely or not conserved in viruses outside the order Nidovirales. The latter enzymes are believed to be involved in unique metabolic pathways used by coronaviruses to (1) replicate and transcribe their extremely large RNA genomes, and (2) interfere with cellular functions and antiviral host responses. Since the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, major efforts have been made to elucidate the structures of the protein components of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex. Thus, in less than 5 years, the structures of as many as 16 SARS-CoV proteins or functional domains have been determined. Remarkably, eight of these 16 structures had novel folds, illustrating the uniqueness of the coronavirus replicative machinery. Furthermore, several new protein functions and potential drug targets have been identified in these studies. Current structural studies mainly focus on the few remaining proteins for which no structural information is available and larger protein complexes comprised of different nsps. The studies aim at obtaining detailed information on the functions and macromolecular assembly of the coronavirus replication/transcription machinery which, over a long period of time, may be used to develop selective antiviral drugs. This chapter reviews structural information on the SARS-CoV macro domain (ADRP) as well as nsps 7, 8, 9, and 15 and summarizes our current knowledge of active-site residues and intermolecular interactions of these proteins.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imbert, Isabelle; Ulferts, Rachel; Ziebuhr, John; Canard, Bruno","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd63b73a5f8b255fd90629310e72935b32f7e1aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV proteins","SARS coronavirus","SARS-CoV replication","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","SARS-CoV macro domain","RNA helicase","coronavirus replication","structures","global outbreak of SARS","Current structural studies","protein components","nonstructural proteins","remaining proteins","new protein functions","large RNA genomes","plus-strand RNA viruses","larger protein complexes","detailed information","common components of replication complexes","protease","chapter reviews structural information","cellular functions","transcription machinery","coronavirus replicative machinery","different nsps","phosphatase activities","enzymes","multiple enzymatic activities","O-methyltransferase activities","transcription complex","adenosine diphosphate-ribose","current knowledge of active","antiviral host responses","selective antiviral drugs","site residues","macromolecular assembly","replicase gene","potential drug targets","intermolecular interactions","uniqueness","picornavirus","ADRP","endoribonuclease","exoribonuclease","papain","functional domains","unique metabolic pathways","coronaviruses","long period of time","novel folds","major efforts","order Nidovirales","years"],"language":"en"},

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to be the causative agent of SARS. The typical clinical feature associated with SARS is diffuse alveolar damage in lung, and lung fibrosis is evident in patients who died from this disease. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes lung fibrosis are not fully understood, but transforming growth factor-\u03B2 (TGF-\u03B2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated lung fibrosis are among the most documented ones. The activation of the TGF-\u03B2/Smad pathway is critical to lung fibrosis. SARS-CoV infection not only enhances the expression of TGF-\u03B2, but also facilitates its signaling activity. The SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is a negative regulator of lung fibrosis, and SARS-CoV infection decreases ACE2 expression. Therefore, SARS-CoV infection may lead to lung fibrosis through multiple signaling pathways and TGF-\u03B2 activation is one of the major contributors.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Wei; Zhao, Xingang; Chen, Ye-Guang","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d39b8fbfaf41b1c1dbf5e977fae79418593fb0e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV receptor ACE2","mediated lung fibrosis","negative regulator of lung fibrosis","TGF-\u03B2 activation","causative agent of SARS","expression of TGF","ACE2 expression","growth factor-\u03B2","acute infectious disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","Smad pathway","pathways","alveolar damage","significant mortality","enzyme","angiotensin","patients","typical clinical feature","novel coronavirus","mechanisms","major contributors","documented ones","activity"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated the role of curcumin chitosan (CuCs) nanocomposite as a potential anti-HCV-4a agent in human hepatoma cells Huh7. METHODS: Docking of curcumin and CuCs nanocomposite and binding energy calculations were carried out. Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and CuCs nanocomposite were prepared with an ionic gelation method and characterized with TEM, zeta size and potential, and HPLC to calculate encapsulation efficiency. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on Huh7 cells using MTT assay and confirmed with cellular and molecular assays. Anti-HCV-4a activity was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The strength of binding interactions between protein ligand complexes gave scores with NS3 protease, NS5A polymerase, and NS5B polymerase of -124.91, -159.02, and -129.16, for curcumin respectively, and -68.51, -54.52, and -157.63 for CuCs nanocomposite, respectively. CuCs nanocomposite was prepared at sizes 29\u201339.5 nm and charges of 33 mV. HPLC detected 4% of curcumin encapsulated into CsNPs. IC50 was 8 \u00B5g/mL for curcumin and 25 \u00B5g/mL for the nanocomposite on Huh7 but was 25.8 \u00B5g/mL and 34 \u00B5g/mL on WISH cells. CsNPs had no cytotoxic effect on tested cell lines. Apoptotic genes\u2019 expression revealed the caspase-dependent pathway mechanism.

SOURCES: The main source of data and information for this review was peer-reviewed literature. SYNTHESIS: Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS: Colostrum and transition milk contain an abundance of bioactive molecules that can positively affect gut development and microbiota. There is significant potential for the use of novel feeding strategies and microbial-based products as alternatives to antibiotics. Calves fed an elevated plane of nutrition in the first month of life have greater productivity and growth. However, weaning should take place later in life. Moreover, applying a proper step-down feeding protocol is recommended, as it allows calves to intake and digest sufficient solid feed for growth and minimize distress at weaning.","publish_time":"2019-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, A.J.; Villot, C.; van Niekerk, J.K.; Yohe, T.T.; Renaud, D.L.; Steele, M.A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/664cfdc02e912c3ee153f5a078ddca401944e2bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transition milk","weaning calves","high volumes of milk","high amounts of milk","elevated plane of milk nutrition results","increased future milk production","calf nutrition","use of novel feeding strategies","proper step-down feeding protocol","elevated plane of nutrition","calf health","hours of life","month of life","growth","sufficient volume of colostrum","peer-reviewed literature","antibiotic use","increased ADG","potential benefits","information base","implementation of proper nutritional management","significant potential","Published literature","greater productivity","nutritional strategy","sufficient solid feed","abundance of bioactive molecules","myriad of bioactive compounds","microbial-based products","structure","massive changes","studies","microbiology","diarrhea","main source of data","alternatives","distress","intake","PURPOSE","APPLICATIONS","gut development","SOURCES","gastrointestinal tract","antibiotics","survival","CONCLUSIONS","microbiota","SYNTHESIS","disease","place"],"language":"en"},

Design Clinical vignettes study. Setting 200 clinical vignettes representing real-world scenarios in primary care. Intervention/comparator Condition coverage, suggested condition accuracy, and urgency advice performance was measured against the vignettes\u0027 gold-standard diagnoses and triage level. Primary outcome measures Outcomes included (i) proportion of conditions \u0027covered\u0027 by an app, i.e. not excluded because the patient was too young/old, pregnant, or comorbid, (ii) proportion of vignettes in which the correct primary diagnosis was amongst the top 3 conditions suggested, and, (iii) proportion of \u0027safe\u0027 urgency level advice (i.e. at gold standard level, more conservative, or no more than one level less conservative). Results Condition-suggestion coverage was highly variable, with some apps not offering a suggestion for many users: in alphabetical order, Ada: 99.0%; Babylon: 51.5%; Buoy: 88.5%; K Health: 74.5%; Mediktor: 80.5%; Symptomate: 61.5%; Your.MD: 64.5%.

We show that in the integrable setting, linear anisotropic osmosis minimises an energy that involves a suitable quadratic form which models local directional structures. In our shadow removal applications we estimate the local structure via a modified tensor voting approach (Moreno, 2012) and use this information within an anisotropic diffusion inpainting that resembles edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion inpainting (Weickert, 2006, Gali\\\u0027c, 2008). Our numerical scheme combines the nonnegativity preserving stencil of Fehrenbach and Mirebeau (Fehrenbach, 2014) with an exact time stepping based on highly accurate polynomial approximations of the matrix exponential. The resulting anisotropic model is tested on several synthetic and natural images corrupted by constant shadows.

The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020. Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19.

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented challenge.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Procko, Erik","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81d8c669c641adaaaa70428d2fcfaae7d114bc5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S binding sites","receptor binding sites","increased binding","receptor binding domain","SARS-CoV","variants of ACE2","Soluble ACE2","buried sites","viral spike protein S binds ACE2","escalating spread of SARS coronavirus","viral genome","host cells","peptides","engineering high affinity proteins","blueprint","molecular events","candidate","presentation","N90-glycosylation motif","large increases","Mutations","decoy","entry","local folding","interaction epitope","diagnostic development","mutational landscape","immediate public health emergency","single substitutions","interface","deep mutagenesis","coronaviruses","unprecedented challenge"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place-adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80% higher for Blacks and over 50% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level.

In doing so we provide an additional modelling basis for laying out the strategy options for the decision-makers. The main results are illustrated and discussed in Part I. In Part II, we describe the stochastic model that we have developed for modelling this epidemic. As argued in Part II, the developed model is more flexible than the SEIR/SEIRS models and can be used for modelling the scenarios which may be difficult or impossible to model with the SEIR/SEIRS models. To compare different scenarios for exiting from the lock-down, in Part III we provide our previous report on the same topic where similar (although not as detailed) scenarios were considered. As the possible exit dates, we have chosen May 4, May 11, May 18 and May 25. We model differently the regions with high initial reproductive number chosen to be R0=2.5, medium R0=2.3 and low R0=2.The numbers for the whole of the UK can be obtained by appropriate averaging of the numbers given in the report. Typical figures are given in Section 4. For each scenario considered, we plot the expected proportion of infected at time t and the expected number of deaths at time t. To compute the expected numbers of deaths we used the total mortality rate 0.66%. Many recent studies suggest lower values and therefore the numbers in our projections should be considered as rather pessimistic. Our analysis suggests a value around 0.5% for the mortality rate. In the model, we assume that the isolation of older and vulnerable people continues and the public carries on certain level of isolation until the end of 2020; also we assume that immunity is kept for at least a year and there is no international travel influence. Our main conclusions are: In regions with higher initial reproductive number 2.5 the proportion of susceptible at the start of the lock-down should be not smaller than 0.95, the epidemic curve in such regions is in the fast monotonic decline irrespectively of the date of the lock-down lift; In regions with lower initial reproductive number 2.0 the second mild wave can be expected, the difference between the expected mortality rates is very small for all May 2020 lifting lock-down dates; In regions with initial reproductive number 2.3, a mild second wave can be expected in the case of large proportion of susceptible at the start of the lock-down, but its severity and resulting mortality depend very little on the date of lifting the lock-down; For the overall UK epidemic, even for rather pessimistic scenarios considered, the second wave is much less pronounced (in terms of the expected mortality rate) than the first one, and the total numbers of expected deaths are within 2% for all May 2020 dates of lifting the lock-down. Moreover, by keeping R0-value after lifting the lock-down below 1.75 is likely to lead to the avoidance of a UK-wide second wave, see Section 4. We believe that the model build in this work can be considered as an important decision support tool to help decision-makers with the strategy of handling the epidemic. We invite other scholars to participate in an open discussion of the strategy options. We feel that this kind of models should be used in the short and long term management of the disease. We recommend the development of a permanent and modularised modelling suite for COVID-19 management to which additional modules can be added as anti-viral drugs and vaccination are introduced, extending the options. We trust that this work makes a start in that direction and demonstrates the advantages of a heterogeneous demographic refinement, which can only improve targeting role out of treatments.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhigljavsky, A.; Fesenko, I.; Wynn, H.; Kremnitzer, K.; Noonan, J.; Gillard, J.; Whitaker, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51e6911a554c572be4d9ae8d2a1fb856d1edbfd0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20077818v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","SEIR/SEIRS"],"locations":["Part I."],"keyphrases":["lifting lock","expected number of deaths","expected numbers of deaths","regions","expected mortality rates","total numbers of expected deaths","developed model","expected proportion of infected","model build","stochastic model","lower initial reproductive number","higher initial reproductive number","high initial reproductive number","different scenarios","pessimistic scenarios","total mortality rate","mild second wave","overall UK epidemic","mild wave","strategy options","R0-value","start","work","different exit scenarios","epidemic curve","decision-makers","medium R0","low R0","UK-wide","SEIRS models","additional modelling basis","COVID","modularised modelling suite","possible exit dates","Section","kind of models","case of large proportion of susceptible","time t","important decision support tool","lower values","isolation of older","additional modules","previous report","main conclusions","main results","certain level of isolation","long term management","public carries","vulnerable people","advantages","anti-viral drugs","vaccination","open discussion","fast monotonic decline","terms","difference","heterogeneous demographic refinement","year","topic","disease","recent studies","end","avoidance","development","direction","appropriate averaging","severity","international travel influence","targeting role","treatments","scholars","Typical figures","primary objective","projections","immunity","analysis"],"language":"en"},

There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS). RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI: 1.989-11.246; p\u003C0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03).

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro=4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro=2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro \u003E 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities.

To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, which binds viral RNA and assembles into a filament that is packaged into new virions. We determined a 1.4 \u00C5 resolution crystal structure of this protein\u2019s N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer very similar to that of related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Using size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, we find that this domain forms a dimer in solution, and that addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates tetramer formation. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an \u03B1-helix that either self-associates or docks against the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of over 4,400 individual amino acid substitutions in the N protein from ~17,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and find that they are strongly clustered in the protein\u2019s N2a linker domain. The nearly 300 substitutions identified within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As the N protein is a common target of patient antibodies, this work will also benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust and specific serological tests, and could also benefit the analysis of patient-derived antibodies. Significance Statement After infecting a cell, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus replicates its genome and packages it into new virus particles. The virus\u2019s nucleocapsid (N) protein is critical for this process, binding the genomic RNA and assembling into large filaments before being packaged into new virions. Here, we sought to understand the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and how it forms large assemblies. We combined x-ray crystallography and two biochemical methods to show that the protein\u2019s N2b and N3 domains mediate self-association into dimers and tetramers, respectively. We have therefore outlined the first two steps of a probable three-step self-assembly mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. This work will benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust viral tests and to develop new drugs targeting key steps in the viral life cycle.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Qiaozhen; West, Alan M.V.; Silletti, Steve; Corbett, Kevin D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f057c47d3e8d1dc96c5a6e2cf7dbf62cc43e8e9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein","MERS-CoV","related coronaviruses SARS-CoV","protein\u2019s N2b domain","key protein","disordered domain","viral RNA","viral life cycle","work","new virions","protein\u2019s N2a linker domain","robust viral tests","self-assembly properties","new drugs","N2b domains cluster","N3 domains","key steps","ongoing efforts","robust testing","genomic RNA","functional RNA binding","new virus particles","tetramer formation","architecture","virus\u2019s nucleocapsid","step self-assembly mechanism","self-association","self-associates","common target of patient antibodies","large filaments","intertwined dimer","analysis of patient","genome sequences","derived antibodies","large assemblies","specific serological tests","individual amino acid substitutions","\u00C5 resolution crystal structure","C-terminal spacer B","multi-angle light scattering","size exclusion chromatography","severe acute public health threat","addition","novel treatments","dimers","packages","docks","causative agent","hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry","biochemical methods","deep understanding","pandemic","dimerization interfaces","process","N1b","cell","\u03B1-helix","x-ray crystallography","evidence","century","locations","tetramers","crisis","Significance Statement","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. Material and methods - We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. Results - We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. Discussion - This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to therapeutic approaches that affect specific pathways, by approaches that target the aging process.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santesmasses, Didac; Castro, Jos\u00E9 Pedro; Zenin, Aleksandr A; Shindyapina, Anastasia V; Gerashchenko, Maxim V; Zhang, Bohan; Kerepesi, Csaba; Yim, Sun Hee; Fedichev, Peter O; Gladyshev, Vadim N","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a364940fb21810bb45ca33457c51653442adfd05.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20060095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["COVID","SARS-CoV","age dependence","multiple age-related diseases","deadly respiratory diseases","all-cause pneumonia","all-cause human mortality","subjects","increased mortality","addition","similar mortality patterns","respiratory failure","therapeutic approaches","aging process","severe viral pneumonia","emergent disease of aging","death","greatest challenges","public health","China","reason","Spain","recent years","South Korea","doubling time","specific pathways","major risk factors","pre-existing conditions","Italy","men","ongoing pandemic","gene expression of ACE2","case fatality rate","lung","receptor","coronavirus","ventilator","findings","turn"],"language":"en"},

Of particular need are the N95 medical face respirators that filter 95% of all airborne particles at and above 0.3 um in diameter, many of which use meltblown microfibers of charged polypropylene (e.g, the 3M 8200). An intensive search is underway to find reliable methods to lengthen the useful life of these normally disposable units. It is currently believed that these masks and respirators cannot be cleaned with 70 to 75% alcohol-water solutions, as past wet/dry experiments show that filtration efficiency can drop by ~40% after the first such treatment. This has been interpreted as the liquids disrupting the surface charge on the fibers and has led to a recent CDC/NIOSH advisory against using alcohol for their decontamination. We have replicated the drop in efficiency after alcohol treatment. However, we find that the efficiency can be recovered by more effective drying, which we achieve with a vacuum chamber. Drying at pressures of \u003C ~6 mBar (0.6 kPa) restores the measured filtering efficiency to within 2% or so of the pre-washing value, which we have sustained for 5 cleaning-drying cycles so far in three models of N95 masks. The mechanism seems to be the removal of water molecules adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, a hypothesis which is supported by two independent observations: (A) the filtering efficiency increases non-linearly with the weight loss during drying, and (B) filtration efficiency shows an abrupt recovery as the vacuum pressure drops from 13 to 6 mBar, the range physically attributable to the removal of adsorbed water. These results are not compatible with the electrostatic discharge hypothesis, and rather suggest that water molecules adsorbed to the fiber surface are reducing the filtration efficiency via surface tension interactions (e.g., wicking between the fibers and coating their surfaces with a film). Such a degradation mechanism has two implications: (A) Respirators decontaminated by a soak in 70% v/v ethanol regain their filtration efficiency once they are fully dry. We employ vacuum chambers in this study, which are inexpensive and commonly available. (B) This mechanism presents the possibility that mask filtration performance may be subject to degradation by other sources of moisture, and that the mask would continue to be compromised even if it appears dry. The mask would need to be vacuum-dried to restore its performance. This study introduces a number of methods which could be developed and validated for use in resource-limited settings. As the pandemic spreads to rural areas and developing nations, these would allow for local efforts to decontaminate, restore, monitor, and test medical masks.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazeeri, A.

We aimed at identifying genes co-expressed with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the human cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and unveiled several genes correlated or inversely correlated with high significance, among the most significant of these was the transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4). Serine proteases are known to be involved in the infection process by priming the virus spike protein. Pathway analysis revealed papilloma virus infection amongst the most significantly correlated pathways. Gene Ontologies revealed regulation of viral life cycle, immune responses, pro-inflammatory responses-several interleukins such as IL6, IL1, IL20 and IL33, IFI16 regulating the interferon response to a virus, chemo-attraction of macrophages, last and not least cellular stress resulting from activated Reactive Oxygen Species. We believe that this dataset will aid in a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wruck, Wasco; Adjaye, James","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9aaa86fd463a3a357a95a79ccdccd21fd8ce1062.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontologies"],"organizations":["Reactive Oxygen Species"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","human lung epithelial cells","papilloma virus infection","COVID","virus spike protein","transmembrane serine protease","human cell entry receptor of SARS","immune responses","Pathway analysis","infection process","protease inhibitor","genes co-","Serine proteases","pro-inflammatory responses","meta-analysis of RNA","regulation of viral life cycle","studies","immense burden","sequencing data","IL33","province Hubei","ACE2","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","national economies","therapies","IL1","IFI16","HIV","molecular mechanism","IL6","interleukins","interferon response","better understanding","global health","Gene Ontologies","cellular stress","remdesivir","Ebola drug","antiviral agents","IL20","angiotensin","nelfinavir","pandemic","enzyme","macrophages","chemo-attraction","Reactive Oxygen Species","Chinese city of Wuhan","vaccination","drugs","TMPRSS4","high significance","lopinavir","dataset","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease\u0027s cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is efficient to contain the viral spread, it is unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted. We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoertel, N.; Blachier, M.; Blanco, C.; Olfson, M.; Massetti, M.; Limosin, F.; Leleu, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e36d41bf7a00554f2259f02fff5f10daf2325e64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076885v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lifting quarantine","two-step quarantine","COVID","post-quarantine screening","potential impact of quarantine duration","lower cumulative mortality","single step","lower ICU-bed occupancy","diminished epidemic rebound","variation of model parameter values","model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures","stochastic agent-based microsimulation model","disease\u0027s cumulative incidence","younger population","ICU capacity","older population","hypothetical effective treatment","little impact","viral spread","Global spread of coronavirus disease","mitigation policy","public source code repository","unprecedented infectious disease crisis","New York City","sufficient time","herd immunity effect","outcome estimates","course","strategy","weeks","type","contrast","individuals","uncertainties","ICUs","consequences"],"language":"en"},

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People\u0027s Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. Methods We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. Results We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R 0 . The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature. Discussion In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Zandvoort, K.; Jarvis, C.

We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB). Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Emanuel, Wyler; Kirstin, M\u00F6sbauer; Vedran, Franke; Asija, Diag; Theresa, Gottula Lina; Roberto, Arsie; Filippos, Klironomos; David, Koppstein; Salah, Ayoub; Christopher, Buccitelli; Anja, Richter; Ivano, Legnini; Andranik, Ivanov; Tommaso, Mari; Simone, Del Giudice; Patrick, Papies Jan; Alexander, M\u00FCller Marcel; Daniela, Niemeyer; Matthias, Selbach; Altuna, Akalin; Nikolaus, Rajewsky; Christian, Drosten; Markus, Landthaler","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0830b3286c606899cb594bd9617a5d086f6be59d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study SARS-CoV","therapeutic intervention of SARS","HSP90 protein","gene expression profiles of SARS","human cell lines","single-cell transcriptomics","interferon response","interferon beta","cell culture models","Single cell RNA sequencing data","interferon regulatory factors","permissive human epithelial cell line Calu","coronavirus disease","protein relevant","canonical interferon stimulated genes","HSP90 charperone activity","reduction of viral replication","heat shock protein","subset of infected cells","host responses","strong expression","NF-\u03BAB","infected people","disease progression","Small RNA profiling","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","temporal resolution of transcriptional responses","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","immunity","potential drug target","activities","IRFs","inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA","Tanespimycin","TNF","IFIT2","molecular biology","H1299","Caco","infections","addition","IFNB1","lambda","OAS2","bulk","N-allylamino","induction of cytokines","IL1B mRNA levels","ongoing global health threat","demethoxygeldanamycin","CXCL10","Detailed knowledge","pandemic","emergence","Inhibition","higher stimulation","COVID","IL6","AAG","IFNL1","summary","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Lesson from the first lockdown","doi":"10.1101/2020.04.22.20075499","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. It has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In India, it is already reported more than 18 thousand cases and more than 600 deaths due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) till April 20, 2020. Previous studies on various viral infections like influenza have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that the cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments favor the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. These viral transmissions found attenuated in warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments. However, the role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze the local weather patterns of the Indian region affected by the COVID-19 virus for March and April months, 2020. We have investigated the effect of meteorological parameters like Temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity on the rate of spread of COVID-19 using daily confirm cases in India. We have used daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017-2019) for March and April month and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to April 15. We found a positive association (Pearsons r=0.56) between temperature and daily COVID-19 cases over India. We found a negative association of humidity (RH and AH) with daily COVID-19 Cases (Persons r=-0.62, -0.37). We have also investigated the role of aerosol in spreading the pandemic across India because its possible airborne nature. For this, we have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the first lockdown period (25 March-15 April) in India. We found a negative association in March when there were few cases, but in April, it shows positive association when the number of cases is more (for AOD it was r=-0.41 and r=0.28 respectively). During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and other pollutants (NO2; an indicator of PM2.5) reduced sharply with a percentage drop of about 36 and 37, respectively. This reduction may have reduced the risk for COVID-19 through air transmission due to the unavailability of aerosol particles as a base. HYSPLIT forward trajectory model also shows that surface aerosols may travel up to 4 km according to wind and direction within three h of its generation. If coronavirus becomes airborne as suggested by many studies, then it may have a higher risk of transmission by aerosols particles. So relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants, factories, and other facilities would be a wrong choice and could result in more COVID-19 incidences and deaths in India. Therefore the current study, although limited, suggests that it is doubtful that the spread of COVID-19 would slow down in India due to meteorological factors, like high temperature and high humidity. Because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of high Tem, high Relative, and high absolute humidity regions of India. Thus our results in no way suggest that COVID-19 would not spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon. So effective public health interventions should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. If COVID-19 is indeed sensitive to environmental factors, it could be tested in the coming summer-monsoon for India. So the only summer is not going to help India until monsoon is coming. Only government mitigations strategies would be helpful, whether its lockdown, aggressive and strategic testing, medical facilities, imposing social distancing, encouraging to use face mask or monitoring by a mobile application (Aarogya Setu).","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97ec3c08e30bea4a4588713345cffbde6c86784a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075499v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aarogya Setu"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","transmission of COVID","daily COVID","high humidity","high absolute humidity regions of India","relative humidity","negative association of humidity","high temperature","low absolute humidity","association of aerosols","large number of cases","positive association","role of temperature","meteorological factors","AOD","aerosols particles","Coronavirus disease","lockdown period","study period","range of high Tem","meteorological condition","surface aerosols","air transmission","Pearsons r","Persons r","higher risk of transmission","humid regions","pandemic","environments","NO2","effect of meteorological parameters","new disease","environmental factors","averaged meteorological data","viral transmissions","infectious disease","deaths","viral diseases","role of aerosol","current study","novel Coronavirus","various viral infections","unavailability of aerosol particles","coming summer-monsoon","environmental rules","Previous studies","World Health Organization","possible airborne nature","effective public health interventions","terms of pollutant emissions","control measures","influenza","RH","power plants","prevention","factories","Indian region","local weather patterns","AH","epidemiological hypothesis","scientific basis","HYSPLIT forward trajectory model","Wuhan","facilities","pollutants","survival","pollutions","direction","Hubei Province","China","nCoV","epidemiology","droplet","base","incidences","rate","indicator of PM2","wrong choice","wind","generation","work","years","results","way","multiple countries","medical emergency","percentage drop","months","reduction","medical facilities","strategic testing","social distancing","mobile application","face mask","lockdown","government mitigations strategies","Aarogya Setu","India","summer","monsoon"],"language":"en"},

The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous scrutiny to which tests are normally subjected to prior to FDA approval. The need to identify the COVID-19 positive cases quickly and accurately has propelled the release of a variety of assays intended to meet the urgent demand. Several Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) platforms are currently available. Our laboratory currently uses two real time RT-PCR platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Both platforms demonstrate comparable performance; however the run times for each assay are 3.5 hours and 45 minutes, respectively. In search for a platform with shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 minutes. We present here the result comparisons between Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in VTM as well as dry nasal swabs for the Abbott assay. Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 missed a third of the samples detected positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using NP swabs in VTM and over 48% when using dry nasal swabs.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basu, Atreyee; Zinger, Tatyana; Inglima, Kenneth; Woo, Kar-mun; Atie, Onomie; Yurasits, Lauren; See, Benjamin; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44b048b91a952e5473af79c6f7c2edd7a0a08980.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.089896","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","Several Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests","Roche Cobas","Cepheid Xpert Xpress","Abbot ID","NP"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["COVID","Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV","dry nasal swabs","Abbot ID","NP swabs","Abbott assay","Abbott ID","nasopharyngeal swabs","VTM","positive results","positive cases","minutes","Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2","real time RT-PCR platforms","reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation","availability of molecular diagnostic assays","variety of assays","shorter turnaround time","Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests","clinical laboratories","formidable challenges","NAAT","sample type","United States","Emergency Use Authorization","EUA","pandemic","run times","rigorous scrutiny","crisis","method of collection","comparable performance","result comparisons","samples","search","hours","recent emergence","swift advance","release","urgent demand","FDA approval","need"],"language":"en"},

We generate IMRCs through sequentially differentiating hESCs with xeno-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through their paracrine functions. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and FDA-approved pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice, monkeys and two severely ill COVID-19 patients in our pilot study.

Abstract In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China. Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19. The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crespo, Roland Mojica; Morales Crespo, Mairim Melissa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ab9eba78973bd904db2d0786e51673701dd9ae5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359320301714; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359320301714?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","china"],"keyphrases":["and the","The origin of","the infection of","The purpose of","and treatment of the","of unknown origin","the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world","new virus","nuevo virus","nuevo coronavirus","study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen","the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus","regi\u00F3n china","This new coronavirus was called SARS","becoming a health emergency of international concern and later","Abstract In","some cases of atypical pneumonia","as well as epidemiology","Days later","were reported in Wuhan","was named COVID","enfermedad","virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region","at that","with bats being its probable vector","origen desconocido","presumed zoonotic","review","pathology","December","transmission","prevention","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas","transmisi\u00F3n","prevenci\u00F3n","momento","Due","informaci\u00F3n","neumon\u00EDa at\u00EDpica","epidemiolog\u00EDa","patolog\u00EDa","tratamiento","muertes","murci\u00E9lagos","pandemic","preocupaci\u00F3n internacional","emergencia sanitaria","brote aislado","agente etiol\u00F3gico","revisi\u00F3n","acelerado n\u00FAmero de contagios","serie de casos","mundo","infecci\u00F3n","Resumen","prop\u00F3sito","pandemia","D\u00EDas"],"language":"es"},

Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared. Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p\u003C0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence.

Nanopore metagenomic sequencing has the potential to be deployed for near-patient testing, providing rapid diagnosis of infection, rationalising antimicrobial therapy, and supporting interventions for infection control. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of this sequencing approach as a routine laboratory test for influenza in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted Nanopore metagenomic sequencing for 180 respiratory samples from a UK hospital during the 2018/19 influenza season, and compared results to routine molecular diagnostic testing. We investigated drug resistance, genetic diversity, and nosocomial transmission using influenza sequence data. Results: Metagenomic sequencing was 83% (75/90) sensitive and 93% (84/90) specific for detecting influenza A viruses compared with the diagnostic standard (Cepheid Xpress/BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel). We identified a H3N2 genome with the oseltamivir resistant S331R mutation in the NA protein, potentially associated with the emergence of a distinct intra-subtype reassortant. Whole genome phylogeny refuted suspicions of a transmission cluster in the infectious diseases ward, but identified two other clusters that likely reflected nosocomial transmission, associated with a predominant strain circulating in the community. We also detected a range of other potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria from the metagenome.

Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Our preliminary analysis exemplifies a spectrum of potential applications for the database, including identifying characteristic germline usage biases in receptor-binding domain antibodies and contextualising the diagnostic value of the SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s through comparison to over 500 million antibody sequences from SARS-CoV serologically naive individuals. Community submissions are invited to ensure CoV-AbDab is efficiently updated with the growing body of data analysing SARS-CoV-2.

The main route of transmission is considered to be the inhalation of large respiratory drops, by deposition in the mucosa and hands or contaminated fomites. The objective is to identify the interventions to be performed during hospitalization for the correct and safe handling of clothing and hygiene of patients and health professionals. Method: Scoping review carried out without chronological or language delimitation in the PUBMED and Cochrane databases. Tracking standards and recommendations of national and international government entities to answer the research question on the safe handling of clothing and skin hygiene in patients and in health professionals to avoid Covid-19 infection. The data analysis was carried out in two stages: in the first, identification and categorization of the studies, and in the second, content analysis as an informative and classifying criterion. Results: 14 documents have been selected, mainly from government entities. The recommendations are structured in 5 sections on the management of clothing and skin hygiene of infected patients and health professionals in the hospital setting. Conclusion: The clothing of patients and healthcare personnel are transmitting vehicles of the disease.

Novel methods of N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep HCWs safe. Methods: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as \u003E6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were then assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency (FE). Assessment of PAA off-gassing from a treated mask was also performed. Results: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of N95 respirators in a 2447 cubic feet room with deploy and dwell times of 16 and 32 minutes respectively, and a total cycle time of 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA from the treated masks. Conclusion: The PAA room disinfection system provides a rapidly scalable solution for in-hospital decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators to meet the needs of HCWs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"John, Amrita R; Raju, Shine; Cadnum, Jennifer L; Lee, Kipum; McClellan, Phillip; Akkus, Ozan; Miller, Sharon K; Jennings, Wayne; Buehler, Joy A.; Li, Daniel F; Redmond, Sarah N; Braskie, Melissa; Hoyen, Claudia K; Donskey, Curtis J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bf6f4960d5475d5aba6be0f3186df123af82d0c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20073973v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disinfection of N95 respirators","PAA room disinfection system","PAA room HLDS","hospital decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators","gassing of PAA","Assessment of PAA","treated masks","ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system","Novel methods of N95 filtering facepiece respirator","cubic feet room","filtration efficiency","strap elasticity","hospital use","needs of HCWs","SARS-CoV","minutes","HCWs safe","pandemic","cycle duration","source of great concern","total cycle time","Critical shortages of personal protective equipment","hydrogen peroxide","bacteriophage MS2","Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores","PPE","health care workers","material structure","scalable solution","aerosolized peracetic acid","log10 reductions","adverse effects","hydrophobicity","changes","structural integrity","FFR","Abstract Background","dwell times","hour","Conclusion","multidisciplinary pragmatic study","treatment cycles","Results"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 patients\u0027 hospital length of stay in Sichuan can be informative to decision-making in other regions of the world. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study. Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province from January to March 2020. Outcome measure The length of hospital stay after admissions for confirmed patients. Results From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

The responsiveness of investigators, editorial teams, and publishers was explored. Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric review of COVID-19 literature. A parallel search of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) literature was performed for comparison of outcomes. Data sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search for COVID-19 studies was performed between 1st November 2019 and 24th March 2020. The search for MERS studies was performed one year earlier between 1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019. Main outcome measures: Investigator-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of published research. Editorial-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and the availability of original data to support the study results. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript acceptance to first publication and the provision of open access. Results: In total, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n=242; 60.8%) and the majority of these were case series (n=105; 43.4%) and single cases (n=65; 26.9%). The times from manuscript submission to acceptance (median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) vs 71.5 days (38-106); P\u003C0.001) and acceptance to publication (median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) vs. 22.5 days (4-48.5-; P\u003C0.001) were strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n=396; 99.5%) and MERS (n=55; 100%) studies were available with open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P=0.203). Conclusions: The early academic response to COVID-19 was characterised by investigators aiming to define the disease.

Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cox, Louis Anthony","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a520b75ec6e357522dafef8d7209e552a9374368.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120305314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305314?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["statistical C-R modeling methods","traditional statistical regression modeling of C","interpretable nonlinear C-R functions","reality of nonlinear C-R functions","nonparametric regression modeling","positive exposure-response regression coefficients","biological exposure concentration-response","exposure estimation errors","exposure-related diseases","unadjusted regression coefficients","Realistic dose-response modeling","understanding of biological mechanisms","thresholds","nonlinearities","statistical options","risk analysis","Abstract Recent advances","recent decades","great advances","certain common mechanisms","model specification errors","adverse outcome pathways","causal Bayesian networks","non-causal sources","controlled confounding","dynamic simulation models","valuable complements","ultrasensitive molecular switches","attribution of interactions","explanatory variables","associations","assembly","threats","challenges","activation of inflammasomes","coincident historical trends","time patterns of exposures","lysosomes","pyroptosis of cells","paper","human health","regulations","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences. Methods: We analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27, 2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases CBVDs (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036). Conclusion: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death.

All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. Findings Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 2,341,066 global cases and 161,324 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57-79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the \u201Ccytokine storm syndrome\u201D, a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34-35\u00B0C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40\u00B0- 41\u00B0C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8-5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Contini, Carlo; Enrica Gallenga, Carla; Neri, Gianpiero; Maritati, Martina; Conti, Pio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbc6fc59aaa1133aa20fb4c3c713a82d9ca7dc99.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720309518; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720309518?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","viral thermolability of SARS","viral receptors","Critical patients","arrival of SARS","respiratory failure","viral replication","coronavirus disease","average age of patients","pneumocytes","hospitalization","severe pneumonia","severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia","virus attacks type","lower bronchi","nasopharyngeal swab positive patients","new zoonotic coronavirus","ACE2 receptor","respiratory viruses","new strain of coronavirus","COVID","world","acute respiratory distress syndrome","oxygen therapy","antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles","S protein","aerosol of antiviral","Spike protein","mild infection","phase of infection","global cases","existing data","Asymptomatic infections","underlying disease","data available","therapy of proven efficacy","multi-organ failure","cytokine storm syndrome","anti-inflammatory drugs","parenteral formulation","ARDS","heparin support","extensive lung tissue damage","deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response","antivirals","antiparasitic agents","povidone-iodine eye","septic shock","lungs","intravascular coagulation","phenotypes IV","risk of evolution","label","effect","compassionate use therapies","remdesivir","current management","ciliated bronchial epithelial cells","binding","angiotensin","convalescent plasma","local instillation","excessive immune reaction","activation of interleukin","DIC","numerous tissues","conversion enzyme","transmission","intensive care units","humid heat vaporization","Wuhan","Hubei Province","China","person","host","half","Europe","country","deaths","oropharynx","absence","admission","date","years","Italy","conjunctival congestion","low temperatures","bat species","droplets","humans","frequency"],"language":"en"},

These inter-individual allelic variants can be shared between or be specific to human populations. The current IG databases IMGT, VBASE2 and IgPdb hold information about germline alleles, most of which are partial sequences, obtained from a mixture of human (B-cell) samples, many with sequence errors and/or acquired (non-germline) IG variations, induced by somatic hypermutation (SHM) during antigen-specific B-cell responses. We systematically identified true germline alleles (without SHM) from 26 different human populations around the world, profiled by the \u201C1000 Genomes data\u201D. Our resource is uniquely enriched with complete IG allele sequences and their frequencies across human populations. We identified 409 IGHV, 179 IGKV, and 199 IGLV germline alleles supported by at least seven haplotypes (= minimum of four individuals), after removal of potential false-positives, based on using other genomic databases, i.e. ENSEMBL, TopMed, ExAC, ProjectMine. Remarkably, the positions of the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random (as observed in case of SHM), but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG data bases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. The identification of these specific patterns provides extra evidence that the identified variant nucleotides are not sequencing errors, but genuine allelic variants. The diversity of germline allelic variants in IGH and IGL loci is the highest in Africans, while the IGK locus is most diverse in Europeans. We also report on the presence of recombination signal sequences (RSS) in V pseudogenes, explaining their usage in V(D)J rearrangements. We propose that this new set of genuine germline IG sequences can serve as a new population-matched IG (pmIG) database for better understanding B-cell repertoire and B-cell receptor selection processes in disease and vaccination within and between different human populations. The database in format of fasta is available via GitHub (https://github.com/InduKhatri/pmIG). Contribution to the Field Statement We present a catalogue of immunoglobulin (IG) germline-alleles of unprecedented completeness and accuracy from 26 different human populations belonging to five different large ethnicities (Source: 1000 Genomes). We identified the population distribution of several known germline alleles and identified multiple new alleles, especially in African populations, indicative of high allelic diversity of IG genes in Africa. Strikingly, the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random, but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG databases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. Furthermore, we identified recombination signal sequences in pseudogenes (previously not known). We provide an overview of IG germline alleles shared with and between known databases and also point to potential sources of non-germline variation and incompleteness of the existing IG databases. More importantly, we believe that this information can serve as a novel population-matched IG (pmIG) database, highly valuable for the research community in supporting the dissection and understanding of differences in effectiveness of antibody-based immune responses in infectious diseases, other (immune) diseases and vaccination within and between human populations. Such knowledge might be used in developing population-specific vaccination strategies e.g. for currently ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khatri, Indu; Berkowska, Magdalena A.; van den Akker, Erik B.; Teodosio, Cristina; Reinders, Marcel J.T.; van Dongen, Jacques J.M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.033530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IG","IgPdb","SHM","GitHub"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["germline-alleles","overview of IG germline alleles","IG kappa","IG heavy","IG lambda","IG variations","different germline IG variable","different alleles","existing IG databases","known germline alleles","IGLV germline alleles","true germline alleles","different human populations","new population-matched IG","IG data bases","new set of genuine germline IG sequences","novel population-matched IG","complete IG allele sequences","current IG databases IMGT","diversity of germline allelic variants","indicative of high allelic diversity of IG genes","identified variant nucleotides","multiple new alleles","specific patterns","African populations","mixture of human","known databases","antigen-specific B-cell responses","genuine allelic variants","B-cell receptor selection processes","potential sources of non-germline variation","diverse antigen-specific B-cell receptors","inter-individual allelic variants","different large ethnicities","developing population-specific vaccination strategies","partial sequences","population level","population distribution","genomic databases","better understanding B-cell repertoire","IGL loci","V pseudogenes","striking patterns","presence of recombination signal sequences","over-time evolutionary selection processes","limited nucleotide positions","pmIG","immune responses","case of SHM","information","Genomes data","IGK locus","catalogue of immunoglobulin","infectious diseases","sequence errors","J rearrangements","removal of potential false-positives","VBASE2","incompleteness","IgPdb","extra evidence","RSS","accuracy","frequencies","unprecedented completeness","effectiveness of antibody","ENSEMBL","TopMed","Africans","somatic hypermutation","usage","samples","ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic","dissection","individuals","format of fasta","IGKV","haplotypes","Field Statement","research community","genetic basis","GitHub","ExAC","ProjectMine","differences","Europeans","identification","world","Contribution","minimum","knowledge","resource","IGHV"],"language":"en"},

Here, we utilize a curated dataset of 12,674 glycans from 1,726 species to develop and apply machine learning methods to extract evolutionary information from glycans. Our deep learning-based language model SweetOrigins provides evolution-informed glycan representations that we utilize to discover and investigate motifs used for molecular mimicry-mediated immune evasion by commensals and pathogens. Novel glycan alignment methods enable us to identify and contextualize virulence-determining motifs in the capsular polysaccharide of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Further, we show that glycan-based phylogenetic trees contain most of the information present in traditional 16S rRNA-based phylogenies and improve on the differentiation of genetically closely related but phenotypically divergent species, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis.

In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time. Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases. Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person.

We conducted this study to describe the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens, their potential interactions and risk factors for possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms (LRTI) among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj. Pilgrims from Marseille who were participating in the Hajj were recruited. Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. Polymicrobial carriage was observed in 73.8% samples. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22, 95%CI [2.04-19.01]). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria. Author summary Despite the recommendation to take individual preventive measures to prevent respiratory tract infections, these infections remain common among Hajj pilgrims. Respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj are usually studied individually, although in their natural environment they often compete or coexist with multiple microbial species. A better understanding of polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx among Hajj pilgrims is important. Our study describes the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens and their potential interactions among pilgrims during the Hajj. We found that polymicrobial carriage was observed in most individuals and that some pathogens associated positively while other did not. Some pathogen associations correlated with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2019-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Van-Thuan; Dao, Thi-Loi; Ly, Tran Duc Anh; Belhouchat, Khadidja; Chaht, Kamel Larbi; Gaudart, Jean; Mrenda, Bakridine Mmadi; Drali, Tassadit; Yezli, Saber; Alotaibi, Badriah; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f563f43927a2344e2ad1a6d491dbcefed29e9e49.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/791004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","Haemophilus","Moraxella","S. pneumoniae","K. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["Marseille","PCR","LRTI"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","rhinovirus carriage","Polymicrobial carriage","Hajj pilgrims","Dual carriage of","acquisition of respiratory pathogens","Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage","main respiratory pathogens","symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections","influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage","number of respiratory viruses","Chronic respiratory disease","Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting","possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms","symptoms of LRTI","LRTI symptoms","French pilgrims","potential interactions","acquisition of rhinovirus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Saudi Arabia","Haemophilus influenzae","better understanding of polymicrobial interactions","result of complex interactions","Staphylococcus aureus","dynamics","stay","days","study period","Influenza viruses","risk factors","individual preventive measures","nasopharynx","recommendation","arrival","independent positive mutual association","successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs","participant","rates","contrast","coronaviruses","pathogen associations","RTIs","bacteria","PCR","individuals","Author summary","multiple microbial species","data","model","Marseille","initial clearance","natural environment","samples"],"language":"en"},

A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a \u0027gold standard\u0027, the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osterdahl, Marc F; Lee, Karla A; Ni Lochlainn, Mary; Wilson, Stuart; Douthwaite, Sam; Horsfall, Rachel; Sheedy, Alyce; Goldenberg, Simon D; Stanley, Christoper J; Spector, Tim D; Steves, Claire","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9350071c50e046209486fa3cafcfa0757a5e6163.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047357","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHS Category","PCR","STARD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP testing","RT-PCR methods","research RT-LAMP method","repeated RT-PCR","PCR positive cases","single RT-LAMP swab","novel method","point of care","current testing","Positive predictive value","standard methods","care homes","number of COVID","accurate testing","index COVID","negative predictive values","mobile testing units","specificity","real-life clinical setting","sensitivity","novel test","significant early clinical sign","reverse transcription loop","gold standard","reliable test","current pandemic","tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","vital signs of patients","nasal","residents","community","isothermal amplification","pharyngeal swabs","service improvement project","detection","efficient diagnostic tool","NHS Category","cost effective","disease","hospitals","need","game changer","PPV","potential","larger cohorts","SARS-CoV","hypothermia","laboratory information","PoC","NPV","Interpretation","Definitive studies","STARD guidelines","Background","minutes","Findings","spread"],"language":"en"},

However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an \u0027\u0027on-off\u0027\u0027 strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rawson, T.; Brewer, T.; Veltcheva, D.; Huntingford, C.; Bonsall, M.

At the moment of birth, the fetus is prepared to face the challenge of labor and the exposure to the outside world, meaning that labor and birth represent the first extrauterine major exposure to a complex microbiota. The vagina, which is a canal for reproduction, is by evolution separated (but not far) from the anus and urethra. Passing through the birthing canal is a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of vaginal and gut microorganisms for the vertical transmission of microbiota not only from our mothers and grandmothers but also from earlier ancestors. Methods Many national and international instructions have been developed since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan in China. All of them pointed out hygiene measures, social distancing and avoidance of social contacts as the most important epidemiological preventive measures. Pregnancy and neonatal periods are considered as high risk for Covid-19 infection. Results The instructions defined the care for pregnant women in the delivery room, during a hospital stay and after discharge. The controversial procedures in the care of Covid-19-suspected or -positive asymptomatic women in labor were: mode of delivery, companion during birth and labor, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and visits during a hospital stay. Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanojevi\u0107, Milan","journal":"Journal of perinatal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["care of Covid","challenge of labor","infection","moment of birth","Pregnancy","hospital","vertical transmission of microbiota","social distancing","mode of delivery","pregnant women","skin contact","delivery room","complex microbiota","hygiene measures","birthing canal","international instructions","outside world","avoidance of social contacts","intergenerational transmission of vaginal","extrauterine major exposure","positive asymptomatic women","important epidemiological preventive measures","new coronavirus SARS-CoV","gut microorganisms","proposed interventions","babies","mechanism","high risk","companion","lives","neonatal periods","families","breastfeeding","visits","coping","hope","grandmothers","Methods","pandemic","fetus","outbreak","beginning","controversial procedures","earlier ancestors","Wuhan","harm","Conclusion","reproduction","evolution","challenging experience","anus","urethra","China","discharge"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted and regional air pollution. In this study, VOCs emissions from a typical iron and steel plant in Yangtze River Delta (YRD, China) were monitored from April 2018 to March 2019. The ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of VOCs were calculated to reveal the influence of VOCs emissions on regional ozone and particulate pollution, and the sensitivity analysis approach was performed to explore the qualitative and quantitative relationships between VOCs and O3, as well as VOCs and PM2.5. The VOCs concentration was 93.76 \u00B1 266.97 ppbv during the study. The OFP was 760.08 \u00B1 2391.90 \u03BCg m-3, and aromatics were the predominant precursors, contributing 54.05% of the total OFP. Furthermore, the SOA estimated by fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) and time-resolved (TR) methods were 6.032 \u00B1 13.347 \u03BCg m-3 and 0.971 \u00B1 4.650 \u03BCg m-3, accounting for 8.65-26.39% (13.78 \u00B1 7.46%) and 1.55-4.20% (2.22 \u00B1 1.23%) of the PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that VOCs were more sensitive to O3 pollution in high pollution domains, whereas VOCs were more sensitive to PM2.5 pollution in low pollution domains. We concluded that reducing VOCs emissions might be effective in alleviating photochemical pollution episodes in areas around iron and steel industry, and the haze pollution occurred in these regions may be caused by the primary emission of PM, and the contribution of SOA was relatively small.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xufeng; Gao, Song; Fu, Qingyan; Han, Deming; Chen, Xiaojia; Fu, Shuang; Huang, Xiqian; Cheng, Jinping","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09218-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OFP","SOA"],"locations":["Yangtze River Delta","China"],"keyphrases":["formation of VOCs","O3 pollution","VOCs concentration","particulate pollution","haze pollution","influence of VOCs emissions","regional air pollution","high pollution domains","low pollution domains","alleviating photochemical pollution episodes","PM2","\u03BCg","important industrial source of air pollution","steel industry emission","steel plant","typical iron","regional ozone","contribution of SOA","total OFP","study","secondary organic aerosol","ozone formation potential","fractional aerosol coefficient","volatile organic compounds","primary emission of PM","Yangtze River Delta","areas","YRD","time","China","FAC","sensitivity analysis approach","quantitative relationships","aromatics","methods","regions","ppbv","predominant precursors","results","accounting","concentrations"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we compared LN(\u002B) and LN(-) colon cancer patients using differential gene expression and network analysis. Colon cancer gene expression data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas and divided into two groups, LN(\u002B) and LN(-). Gene expression networks were constructed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. We identified hub genes, such as APBB1, AHSA2, ZNF767, and JAK2, that were highly differentially expressed. Survival analysis using selected hub genes, such as AHSA2, CDK10, and CWC22, showed that their expression levels were significantly associated with the survival rate of colon cancer patients, which indicates their possible use as prognostic markers. In addition, protein-protein interaction network, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis were performed with selected hub genes from each group to investigate the regulatory relationships between hub genes and LN involvement in colon cancer; these analyses revealed differences between the LN(-) and LN(\u002B) groups. Our network analysis may help narrow down the search for novel candidate genes for the treatment of colon cancer, in addition to improving our understanding of the biological processes underlying LN involvement.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of 133 confirmed COVID-19 cases was conducted from January to March, 2020. They were assigned to mild group (n=65) and severe group (n=68). Univariate analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent predictors of severe cases. An early warning system for COVID-19 was established, with accuracy evaluated by ROC analysis. RESULTS The age of the severe group was significantly elder than that of the mild group (P\u003C0.05). There was no significant difference in epidemiological characteristics except age between the two groups (P\u003E0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression showed that the age, shortness of breath, lymphocyte count, PCT level, LDH level, APTT level, and CRP level were independent predictors for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 prediction model (including independent risk factors) was established, showing a high accuracy and capability for predicting higher risk of severe COVID-19 (with a AUC value of 0.8842, sensitivity value of 84.33%, and specificity value of 96.89%). CONCLUSIONS According to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Chongqing, a positive correlation between age and severity of COVID-19 was found, but no association between epidemiological history and disease severity was seen.

RESULTS With the help of metabarcoding analysis of 279 samples from the Yangtze River, we provided the first integral biogeographic pattern of planktonic and benthic diatoms over a 6030 km continuum along the world\u0027s third largest river. Our study revealed spatial dissimilarity of diatoms under varying landforms, including plateau, mountain, foothill, basin, foothill-mountain, and plain regions, from the river source to the estuary. Environmental drivers of diatom communities were interpreted in terms of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, channel slope and nutrients, and human interference. Typical benthic diatoms, such as Pinnularia, Paralia, and Aulacoseira, experienced considerable reduction in relative abundance downstream of the Three Gorges Dam and the Xiluodu Dam, two of the world\u0027s largest dams. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that benthic diatoms are of particular significance in characterizing motile guild in riverine environments, which provides insights into diatom biogeography and biogeochemical cycles in large river ecosystems.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiawen; Liu, Qingxiang; Zhao, Xianfu; Borthwick, Alistair G L; Liu, Yuxin; Chen, Qian; Ni, Jinren","journal":"Microbiome","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-019-0771-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31806016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Three Gorges Dam"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Typical benthic diatoms","BACKGROUND Diatoms","largest river","river source","Yangtze River","spatial dissimilarity of diatoms","foothill-mountain","large river ecosystems","study","world\u0027s largest dams","great significance","particular significance","diatom biogeography","Gorges Dam","Xiluodu Dam","biogeographic distribution","integral biogeographic pattern of planktonic","Environmental drivers of diatom communities","biogeochemical cycles","channel slope","temperature","Aulacoseira","relative abundance","insights","varying landforms","plateau","experienced considerable reduction","nutrients","active radiation","terms","riverine environments","motile guild","samples","Paralia","Pinnularia","plain regions","basin","continuum","primary productivity"],"language":"en"},

After three doses of oral administrations with 2-week intervals in pigs, neither PEDV S protein-specific humoral nor mucosal immune responses can be detected. The failure of eliciting the PEDV-specific immune response suggested that the BEV system using BmN cells or silkworm pupae as oral immunogen-expression vehicles was not able to overcome the immunological unresponsiveness, which was possibly due to gastrointestinal specific barriers and oral tolerance.

The impact of covid-19 has not been described so far in a military setting. We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective review of covid-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers\u0027 instructions. RESULTS The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours. Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company. Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours. Serological testing revealed positive for both patients. All others showed negative IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of covid-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers. This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baettig, Sascha J; Parini, A; Cardona, I; Morand, G B","journal":"BMJ military health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303575/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Swiss Armed Forces","PCR","Serological"],"locations":["China","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["persistent SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","Positive cases","early weeks of SARS","positive PCR testing","asymptomatic patients","days","Serological testing","case series of infected patients","particular quarantine room","impact of covid","hours","Swiss Armed Forces recruits","CONCLUSIONS Young healthy recruits","mild course of covid","southernmost canton of Switzerland","new coronavirus","canton of Ticino","METHODS Retrospective review of covid","close contacts","rapid symptom","military environment","worldwide pandemic","military setting","prolonged establishment of isolation","complete symptom resolution","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus","recruit school","initial diagnosis","MATERIAL","covert viral transmission","available kit","index patient","manufacturers\u0027 instructions","weekend permission","confined space","INTRODUCTION","persons","total","carriers","associated challenges","nasopharyngeal swabs","negative IgM","IgG","China","company"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. DESIGN Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. RESULTS Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo \u002B AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lednev, Egor M; Kravchenko, Irina V; Furalyov, Vladimir A; Lysenko, Evgeny A; Lemesheva, Iulia S; Grushin, Alexandr A; Dubrov, Vadim E; Vinogradova, Olga L; Popov, Daniil V","journal":"Growth hormone \u0026 IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ghir.2020.101323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IGF1 expression","IGF1 levels","IGF1-dependent genes","IGF1 secretion","expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms","long-term AAs administration","CONCLUSIONS AAs administration","duration of AAs administration","expression of COL1A1","basal blood levels of IGF1","expression of IGF1Ea mRNA","trained skeletal muscle","effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration","extracellular matrix protein expression","LOX genes","training-induced muscle damage","DESIGN Human myotubes","day","large training volumes","placebo groups","marked increase","cross country skiers","weeks","COL3A1","COL5A1","important regulator of collagen","volunteers","subjects","combined group","body mass","growth factor","athletes","effect of amino acids","pronounced changes","OBJECTIVE Insulin","dose","Leu","times","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A previous scoping review and expert consultation survey identified 15 potential low-value intra-hospital practices in the adult orthopaedic trauma population. Limiting the frequency of such practices could reduce adverse events, improve clinical outcomes and free up resources. The aim of this study is to synthesise the evidence on intra-hospital practices for orthopaedic injuries, previously identified as potentially of low value. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluate selected practices according to a priori PICOS statements (Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome-Study design) . We will evaluate the methodological quality for systematic reviews using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2 (AMSTAR-2). Risk of bias in original studies will be evaluated with the Cochrane revised tool for RCTs (RoB2) and with the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. If for a given practice, more than two original studies on our primary outcome are identified, we will conduct meta-analysis using a random effects model and assess heterogeneity using the I2 index. We will assess credibility of evidence (I-IV) based on statistical significance, sample size, heterogeneity and bias as per published criteria. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required as original data will not be collected. Knowledge users from three level I trauma centres are involved in the design and conduct of the study in accordance with an integrated knowledge translation approach. Findings related to the rapid review will be available in May 2020. They will be presented to key stakeholders to inform discussions and raise awareness on low-value injury care. In addition, results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, at national and international scientific meetings and to healthcare associations.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00E9rub\u00E9, M\u00E9lanie; Moore, Lynne; Leduc, St\u00E9phane; Farhat, Imen; Lesieur, Martin; Lamontagne, Jean; Pelet, St\u00E9phane; Berry, Gregory; Tardif, Pier-Alexandre; C\u00F4t\u00E9, Caroline; Paquet, J\u00E9r\u00F4me","journal":"BMJ open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32193261/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Excerpta Medica Database","ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original studies","cohort studies","low value","selected practices","potential low-value intra-hospital practices","Risk of bias","Study design","case-control studies","Systematic Reviews version","non-randomised studies of interventions","adult orthopaedic trauma population","randomised controlled trials","heterogeneity","quasi-RCTs","Measurement Tool","Cochrane revised tool","low-value injury care","trauma centres","INTRODUCTION Orthopaedic injuries","trauma patients","original data","conduct","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","Population-Intervention","Comparator-Outcome","Knowledge users","rapid review","meta-analysis","primary outcome","credibility of evidence","previous scoping review","DISSEMINATION Ethics approval","integrated knowledge translation approach","expert consultation survey","EMBASE","Epistemonikos","international scientific meetings","Medline","awareness","accordance","PICOS statements","random effects model","clinical outcomes","statistical significance","adverse events","sample size","ROBINS","RoB2","Excerpta Medica Database","peer-reviewed journal","healthcare associations","discussions","level","methodological quality","resources","published criteria","AMSTAR","key stakeholders","I2 index","given practice","results","Findings","METHODS","frequency","addition","aim"],"language":"en"},

With regard to oral cancer, there is a complete absence of literature regarding the long-term impact of pandemics on patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). The objective of this article is to put forth an institutional multidisciplinary approach for the evaluation and management of OPMDs. METHODS A multidisciplinary approach was put formalized within our institution to risk stratify patients based on need for in-person assessment vs telehealth assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS With judicious risk stratification of patients based on clinical features of their OPMD and with consideration of ongoing mitigation efforts and regional pandemic impact, providers are able to safely care for their patients. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has required health care practitioners to make novel decisions that are new to us with development of creative pathways of care that focused on patient safety, mitigation efforts, and clinical management of disease processes. The care of patients with OPMDs requires special considerations especially as patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness are also higher risk for the development of OPMDs.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shanti, Rabie M; Stoopler, Eric T; Weinstein, Gregory S; Newman, Jason G; Cannady, Steven B; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Tanaka, Takako I; O\u0027Malley, Bert W; Le, Anh D; Sollecito, Thomas P","journal":"Head \u0026 neck","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care of patients","judicious risk stratification of patients","health care practitioners","management of OPMDs","development of OPMDs","regional pandemic impact","high risk","higher risk","severe COVID","development of creative pathways of care","institutional multidisciplinary approach","consideration of ongoing mitigation efforts","clinical features","clinical management of disease processes","oral cancer","person assessment vs telehealth assessment","long-term impact of pandemics","unprecedented challenges","special considerations","complete absence of literature","novel decisions","facilities","providers","patient safety","evaluation","need","society","illness","malignant disorders","RESULTS","METHODS","frontlines","article","regard","CONCLUSIONS","objective"],"language":"en"},

However, the overall community prevalence of infections has not been properly assessed, as standard surveillance is typically acquired passively among individuals seeking clinical care. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study in which participants provided daily diaries and weekly nasopharyngeal specimens that were tested for respiratory viruses. These data were used to analyze healthcare seeking behavior, compared with cross-sectional ED data and NYC surveillance reports, and used to evaluate biases of medically attended ILI as signal for population respiratory disease and infection. RESULTS The likelihood of seeking medical attention was virus-dependent: higher for influenza and metapneumovirus (19%-20%), lower for coronavirus and RSV (4%), and 71% of individuals with self-reported ILI did not seek care and half of medically attended symptomatic manifestations did not meet the criteria for ILI. Only 5% of cohort respiratory virus infections and 21% of influenza infections were medically attended and classifiable as ILI. We estimated 1 ILI event per person/year but multiple respiratory infections per year. CONCLUSION Standard, healthcare-based respiratory surveillance has multiple limitations. Specifically, ILI is an incomplete metric for quantifying respiratory disease, viral respiratory infection, and influenza infection. The prevalence of respiratory viruses, as reported by standard, healthcare-based surveillance, is skewed toward viruses producing more severe symptoms. Active, longitudinal studies are a helpful supplement to standard surveillance, can improve understanding of the overall circulation and burden of respiratory viruses, and can aid development of more robust measures for controlling the spread of these pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galanti, Marta; Comito, Devon; Ligon, Chanel; Lane, Benjamin; Matienzo, Nelsa; Ibrahim, Sadiat; Shittu, Atinuke; Tagne, Eudosie; Birger, Ruthie; Ud-Dean, Minhaz; Filip, Ioan; Morita, Haruka; Rabadan, Raul; Anthony, Simon; Freyer, Greg A; Dayan, Peter; Shopsin, Bo; Shaman, Jeffrey","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ED","ILI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory surveillance","multiple respiratory infections","prevalence of respiratory viruses","viral respiratory infection","burden of respiratory viruses","cohort respiratory virus infections","population respiratory disease","BACKGROUND Respiratory viral infections","standard surveillance","influenza infections","ILI event","healthcare-based surveillance","self-reported ILI","overall community prevalence of infections","CONCLUSION Standard","NYC surveillance reports","year","individuals","leading cause of disease","virus-dependent","overall circulation","multiple limitations","clinical care","cross-sectional ED data","prospective cohort study","participants","daily diaries","signal","person","weekly nasopharyngeal specimens","helpful supplement","understanding","longitudinal studies","medical attention","incomplete metric","behavior","half","development","symptomatic manifestations","spread","robust measures","METHODS","likelihood","metapneumovirus","criteria","biases","coronavirus","RSV","severe symptoms","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Communicable diseases intelligence","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["mid-March","Australia","Brazil","India"],"keyphrases":["reported cases","overall rate of cases","Confirmed cases","incidence of new cases of COVID","low case fatality rate","highest rate of COVID","slowed rate","global rate","lowest rate of disease","past reporting week new cases","crude case fatality rate","low rates of detection","public health measures","indicative of low levels of COVID","Testing rates","low proportion of people","deaths","public health action","public health capacity","likely reflective of high case detection","known case","international travel","high quality of health care services","past week","reflective of disease occurrence","international reports","years","community adherence","Australian community","social distancing measures","virus","India","dramatic rise","young children","limited diagnostic","vulnerable high-risk groups","Brazil","pattern","reduction","continued suppression","settings","drop","outbreaks","transmission","place of acquisition","cruise ships","areas","comorbidities","spread","cluster","jurisdictions","low-income countries","peak","notifications"],"language":"en"},

Our Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation model uses a recently developed theory for how the migration barriers are affected by the presence of an electric field. All parameters of the model are physically motivated and no fitting parameters are used. The model has been validated by reproducing characteristic faceting patterns of tungsten surfaces that have in previous experiments been observed to only appear in the presence of strong electric fields.

Anecdotal reports suggest that endurance trained (ET) athletes with a high maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) may be at increased risk for AMS. Possible underlying mechanisms include a training-induced increase in resting parasympathetic activity, higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), and lower hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). METHODS In 38 healthy, non-acclimatized men (19 ET and 19 untrained controls (UT), VO2max 66\u00B16 vs. 45\u00B17 mL/min/kg; p\u003C0.001) peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate variability, RMR, and poikilocapnic HVR were assessed at 424m and during 48 hours at 3450m following passive ascent by train (~2 hours). AMS was evaluated by AMS-C score. RESULTS On day 1 at altitude, ET presented with a higher AMS incidence (42% vs. 11%; p\u003C0.05) and severity (AMS-C score: ET: 0.48\u00B10.5 vs UT: 0.21\u00B10.2; p=0.03), but no group difference was found on day 2 and 3. SpO2 decreased upon arrival at altitude (ET: 82\u00B16% vs. UT: 83\u00B14%; ptime\u003C0.001) with a significantly different time course between ET and UT (ptime*group=0.045). Parasympathetic activity decreased at altitude (p\u003C0.001) but was always higher in ET (p\u003C0.05). At altitude RMR increased (p\u003C0.001) and was higher in ET (p\u003C0.001). HVR increased only in ET (p\u003C0.05) and was greater than in UT after 24 and 48 hours (p\u003C0.05). CONCLUSION ET are at higher risk for developing AMS on the first day following passive and rapid ascent to 3450m, possibly due to an increased parasympathetic activity and an increased RMR, while HVR appeared to be of minor importance.

METHODS In an analysis of all tests consecutively performed in Moleculera Labs\u0027 clinical laboratory from April 22, 2013 to December 31, 2016, we identified 206 patients who were prescribed at least one panel prior to and following treatment, and who met the PANDAS/PANS diagnostic criteria. Patient follow-up was performed to collect symptoms and treatment or medical intervention. Of the 206 patients, 58 met the inclusion criteria of providing informed consent/assent and documented pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Clinician and parent-reported symptoms after treatment or medical intervention were categorized as \u0022Improved/Resolved\u0022 (n = 34) or \u0022Not-Improved/Worsened\u0022 (n = 24). These were analyzed for any association between changes in clinical status and changes in Cunningham panel test results. Clinical assay performance was also evaluated for reproducibility and reliability. RESULTS Comparison of pre- and post-treatment status revealed that the Cunningham Panel results correlated with changes in patient\u0027s neuropsychiatric symptoms. Based upon the change in the number of positive tests, the overall accuracy was 86%, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 83% respectively, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 93.4%. When evaluated by changes in autoantibody levels, we observed an overall accuracy of 90%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 92% and an AUC of 95.7%. Assay reproducibility for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.90 (p \u003C 1.67 \u00D7 10-6) and the ELISA assays demonstrated test-retest reproducibility comparable with other ELISA assays. CONCLUSION This study revealed a strong positive association between changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in the level of anti-neuronal antibodies and antibody-mediated CaMKII human neuronal cell activation. These results suggest there may be clinical utility in monitoring autoantibody levels and stimulatory activity against these five neuronal antigen targets as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of infection-triggered autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders.

Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells, and likely disrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) homeostasis. Particularly, it has been reported a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19, including proteinuria, hematuria and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The dynamics of SW-GW interactions may depend on factors such as the relative water levels between streams and aquifers, resulting in a temporal variation of exchange, which imposes complexity to the understanding of such dynamics. This study highlights the use of high-resolution time series and multi-resolution analysis to help to gain insights into such complex dynamics. Wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied on hourly time series of rainfall, stream and spring discharges of a low lying karstified spring catchment to yield a correlation in the time-frequency domain. This analysis provides comprehensive information on the overall impact of the river on the spring, which is supported by the cross-correlation function, as well as by more detailed information, including time-variant influences such as a threshold level of influence. Field observations of turbidity sampling at the spring appear to support this interpretation. This innovative approach relies on basic hydrological parameters, water level or discharge, and is therefore applicable to many other systems with such existing time series.

METHODS We collected individual information and aggregated data on COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to April 17, 2020. We accounted for right-censoring to estimate the CFR and explored the risk factors for mortality. We fitted Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions to time-to-event data using maximum-likelihood estimation. RESULTS We analyzed 82,719 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China, including 4,632 deaths, and 77,029 discharges. The estimated CFR was 5.65% (95%CI: 5.50%-5.81%) nationally, with highest estimate in Wuhan (7.71%), and lowest in provinces outside Hubei (0.86%). The fatality risk among critical patients was 3.6 times that of all patients, and 0.8-10.3 fold higher than that of mild-to-severe patients. Older age (OR 1.14 per year; 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), and being male (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.10-3.04) were risk factors for mortality. The time from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, time from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation, and time from symptom onset to hospitalization were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS Our CFR estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained in mainland China suggest that COVID-19 is more severe than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients, particularly in Wuhan. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic in China. Our estimates can help inform models and the global response to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xiaowei; Yang, Juan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xiling; Zhou, Jiaxin; Chen, Zhiyuan; Li, Jing; Chen, Yinzi; Yan, Han; Zhang, Juanjuan; Zhang, Yongli; Wang, Yan; Qiu, Qi; Gong, Hui; Wei, Xianglin; Wang, Lili; Sun, Kaiyuan; Wu, Peng; Ajelli, Marco; Cowling, Benjamin J; Viboud, Cecile; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","mainland China","severe patients","key time","symptom onset","cases","hospitalized patients","critical patients","risk factors","deceased patients","CFR estimates","estimated CFR","case fatality risk","laboratory confirmation","event data","Wuhan","mortality","highest estimate","aggregated data","event intervals","H1N1 influenza pandemic","healthcare consultation","individual information","hospitalization","lognormal distributions","clinical category","maximum-likelihood estimation","gamma","models","region","times","available official sources","comprehensive picture","severity","Weibull","METHODS","year","global response","wave","OBJECTIVE","deaths","CONCLUSIONS","fold higher","provinces","Hubei","Older age","study","discharges"],"language":"en"},

Pathogenic Th17 cells, characterised by production of IL-17A in the absence of IL-10, are thought to contribute to this inflammation, but in humans, antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17A is an ineffective IBD therapy whereas IL-23 blockade is effective. Here, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of RORC2, the Th17 cell lineage-defining transcription factor, on in vivo-differentiated human Th17 cells and Th17-like regulatory T cells (Th17-Tregs). BMS-336, a small molecule RORC2 inverse agonist, inhibited expression of RORC2-regulated genes in peripheral Th17 cells (CD4\u002B CD25- CD127\u002B CXCR3- CCR4\u002B CCR6\u002B ) in a dose-dependent manner, with similar inhibitory effects on laminar propria mononuclear cells from IBD and non-IBD subjects. Exposure of peripheral Th17-Tregs (CD4\u002B CD25hi CD127lo CXCR3- CCR4\u002B CCR6\u002B ) to BMS-336 also inhibited IL-17A production and prevented inflammatory cytokine-induced destabilisation, as evidenced by preserved FOXP3 expression and epigenetic status of the Treg-specific demethylation region. In parallel, RORC2 inhibition increased the production of IL-10 in Th17-Tregs, resulting in enhanced suppression of inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells. Thus, via its ability to simultaneously inhibit Th17 cells and enhance the stability and function of Th17-Tregs, pharmacological inhibition of RORC2 is a promising approach to suppress inflammation and promote immune regulation in IBD.

To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52 specific monoclonal antibody on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor PD-1 is required for disease remission post anti-CD52; and found that PD-1 deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and DN T cells, while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer-term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells, in mice with EAE. Thus, the rapid repopulation of lymphocytes from central lymphoid organs post anti-CD52 may limit further disease. Furthermore, these data identify DN T cells, a subset with immunoregulatory potential, as a significant hyper-repopulating subset following CD52 mediated depletion.

The protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/34ZAV).Results: In total, 18 studies comprising 114 pregnant women were included in the review. Fever (87.5%) and cough (53.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by fatigue (22.5%), diarrhea (8.8%), dyspnea (11.3%), sore throat (7.5%), and myalgia (16.3%). The majority of patients (91%) had cesarean delivery due to various indications. In terms of fetal and neonatal outcomes, stillbirth (1.2%), neonatal death (1.2%), preterm birth (21.3%), low birth weight (\u003C2500 g, 5.3%), fetal distress (10.7%), and neonatal asphyxia (1.2%) were reported.

Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus. Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out. We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains. The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in ELISA as a pre-screening. Positive, borderline and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different method of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer). Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner. Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccines studies.

Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold\u0027s abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"George, Mercy; Alexander, Arun; Mathew, John; Iyer, Arunachalam; Waterval, Jerome; Simon, Christian; Marchioni, Daniele; Maire, Raphael","journal":"European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06037-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complicated cholesteatoma","plan cholesteatoma surgery","pandemic","treatment of cholesteatoma","surgical management of Cholesteatoma","timing of surgery","COVID","scheduling of surgery","high risk of transmission","recommendations","elective ear surgeries","risk of severe morbidity","careful selection of patients","surgical staff","ideal time","disease severity","available resources","available literature","majority of otological surgeries","complicated acute otitis media","Bezold\u0027s abscess","teaching hospitals","sinus thrombosis","aggressive viral illness","use of appropriate personal protection equipment","METHODS Senior otologic surgeons","meningitis","infection","otolaryngology examination","Specific precautions","various countries","sub-groups","extent","reorganizing schedules","practical tips","immediate intervention","emergencies","mortality","experiences","categories","complications","potential","manuscript","CONCLUSIONS Evidence","stapedotomy","tympanoplasty","PURPOSE","RESULTS","world","decision-making"],"language":"en"},

Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss. To that end, less is known about the how the virus may impact different organ systems. The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2.

However, the fever-based screening procedure employing IRT suffers from low sensitivity, because monitoring body temperature alone is insufficient for detecting infected patients. To overcome the drawbacks of fever-based screening, this study aims to develop and evaluate a multiple vital sign (i.e., body temperature, heart rate and respiration rate) measurement system using RGB-thermal image sensors. Methods: The RGB camera measures blood volume pulse (BVP) through variations in the light absorption from human facial areas. IRT is used to estimate the respiration rate by measuring the change in temperature near the nostrils or mouth accompanying respiration. To enable a stable and reliable system, the following image and signal processing methods were proposed and implemented: (1) an RGB-thermal image fusion approach to achieve highly reliable facial region-of-interest tracking, (2) a heart rate estimation method including a tapered window for reducing noise caused by the face tracker, reconstruction of a BVP signal with three RGB channels to optimize a linear function, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for estimating the pseudo-spectrum from limited time-domain BVP signals within 15 s and (3) a respiration rate estimation method implementing nasal or oral breathing signal selection based on signal quality index for stable measurement and MUSIC algorithm for rapid measurement. We tested the system on 22 healthy subjects and 28 patients with seasonal influenza, using the support vector machine (SVM) classification method. Results: The body temperature, heart rate and respiration rate measured in a non-contact manner were highly similarity to those measured via contact-type reference devices (i.e., thermometer, ECG and respiration belt), with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.71, 0.87 and 0.87, respectively. Moreover, the optimized SVM model with three vital signs yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 85.7% and 90.1%, respectively. Conclusion: For contactless vital sign measurement, the system achieved a performance similar to that of the reference devices. The multiple vital sign-based screening achieved higher sensitivity than fever-based screening. Thus, this system represents a promising alternative for further quarantine procedures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negishi, Toshiaki; Abe, Shigeto; Matsui, Takemi; Liu, He; Kurosawa, Masaki; Kirimoto, Tetsuo; Sun, Guanghao","journal":"Sensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["IRT","BVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measurement system","respiration rate estimation method","screening of patients","multiple vital sign-based screening","heart rate estimation method","multiple signal classification","respiration belt","fever-based screening procedure","reliable system","stable measurement","contactless vital sign measurement","signal processing methods","IRT","signal quality index","monitoring body temperature","rapid measurement","vital signs","RGB channels","classification method","RGB-thermal image sensors","oral breathing signal selection","RGB-thermal image fusion approach","higher sensitivity","MUSIC algorithm","low sensitivity","following image","drawbacks of fever","infected patients","contact-type reference devices","reliable facial region","RGB camera measures blood volume pulse","noise ratio","quarantine procedures","quarantine stations","limited time-domain BVP signals","human facial areas","optimized SVM model","non-contact manner","suspected infectious disease","spread of infectious diseases","nasal","support vector machine","seasonal influenza","variations","pseudo-spectrum","thermometer","light absorption","tapered window","healthy subjects","face tracker","decades","similarity","promising alternative","ECG","specificity values","reconstruction","linear function","nostrils","performance similar","Conclusion","change","Pearson correlation coefficients","infrared thermography","tracking","mouth","Results","study","Background"],"language":"en"},

Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV.

Two researchers independently screened studies for eligibility. Data were extracted from eligible studies regarding study design, participant characteristics, outcomes, and results. Quality of included studies was critically appraised. Of 8437 studies, 56 eligible studies were included. Studies investigated the effects of lighting on the following domains among people with POAG: QoL (18/56), psychophysical measures (16/56), functional vision (10/56), activities of daily living (10/56), and qualitative findings (2/56). POAG negatively affects low-luminance contrast sensitivity, glare symptoms, and dark adaptation time and extent. In vision-related QoL questionnaires, people with POAG report problems with lighting, glare, and dark adaptation more frequently than any other domain. These problems worsen with progressing visual field loss. Early-stage POAG patients experience significantly more difficulties in low-luminance or changing lighting conditions than age-matched controls (AMCs), challenging perceptions of early-stage POAG as asymptomatic. However, performance-based studies seldom show significant differences between POAG participants and AMCs on tasks simulating daily activities under non-optimal lighting conditions. Further research with larger samples is required to optimise ambient and task-oriented lighting that can support patients\u0027 adaptation to POAG.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enoch, Jamie; Jones, Lee; Taylor, Deanna J; Bronze, Carol; Kirwan, James F; Jones, Pete R; Crabb, David P","journal":"Eye","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-019-0679-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ovid Nursing Database","POAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["POAG participants","eligible studies","screened studies","effects of lighting","people","POAG report problems","stage POAG patients","Quality of included studies","performance-based studies","non-optimal lighting conditions","impact of different lighting conditions","task-oriented lighting","vision-related QoL questionnaires","AMCs","glare symptoms","daily activities","luminance levels","dark adaptation time","functional vision","patients\u0027 adaptation","low-luminance contrast sensitivity","activities of daily living","visual function","quality of life","challenging perceptions of early","systematic review of evidence","systematic literature search","progressing visual field loss","tasks","participant characteristics","significant differences","age-matched controls","Embase","PsycINFO","study design","response","primary open-angle glaucoma","following domains","CINAHL","outcomes","difficulties","Ovid Nursing Database","MEDLINE","PsycARTICLES","psychophysical measures","larger samples","results","researchers","eligibility","extent","qualitative findings"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, six fish were treated with implants containing 2.5 mg 11KT and a placebo group of six females of the same age and gametogenic stage were given a blank implant. The implants were intraperitoneally inserted into 4-year-old females at the previtellogenic stage (mean body weight 5580 \u00B1 165 g) and maintained under culture conditions for 8 weeks. Ovary samples for gene expression analysis of lhr, fshr, dmrt1 and foxl2 were collected by biopsy at 3 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Diameters of oocytes increased in response to 11KT treatment, both at 3 and at 8 weeks post-implantation, but no obvious changes were evident in cytology. Three weeks of 11KT treatment did not affect target gene expression, but a tendency for a time-dependent decrease of lhr and dmrt1 mRNA levels was observed in both treatment and placebo groups. By 8 weeks of treatment, however, 11KT implants provoked the upregulation of fshr and foxl2 transcript levels. Furthermore, lhr and dmrt1 transcript abundances recovered by 8 weeks of exposure in both blank- and 11KT-implanted beluga. These results suggest that 11KT, either directly or indirectly, may affect gametogenesis and regulate some key components of the reproductive axis in female beluga.

Ultraviolet decontamination and reuse (UVDR) is a potential approach to mitigate an FFR shortage. A field study sought to understand healthcare workers\u0027 perspectives and potential logistics issues related to implementation of UVDR methods for FFRs in hospitals. METHODS Data were collected at three hospitals using a structured guide to conduct 19 individual interviews, 103 focus group interviews, and 285 individual surveys. Data were then evaluated using thematic analysis to reveal key themes. RESULTS Data revealed noteworthy variation in FFR use across the sample, along with preferences and requirements for the use of UVDR, unit design, and FFR reuse. Based on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), the mean perception of safety in a high mortality pandemic wearing no FFR was 1.25 of 10, wearing an FFR for an extended period without decontamination was 4.20 of 10, and using UVDR was 7.72 of 10. CONCLUSIONS In addition to technical design and development, preparation and training will be essential to successful implementation of a UVDR program. Ultraviolet decontamination and reuse program design and implementation must account for actual clinical practice, compliance with regulations, and practical financial considerations to be successfully adopted so that it can mitigate potential FFR shortages in a pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemeth, Christopher; Laufersweiler, Dawn; Polander, Emily; Orvis, Christianna; Harnish, Del; Morgan, Sherwin E; O\u02BCConnor, Michael; Hymes, Saul; Nachman, Sharon; Heimbuch, Brian","journal":"Journal of patient safety","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175970/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FFR reuse","FFR use","use of UVDR","UVDR program","implementation of UVDR methods","potential FFR shortages","reuse program design","Ultraviolet decontamination","METHODS Data","successful implementation","individual interviews","technical design","unit design","potential approach","high mortality pandemic","FFRs","hospitals","RESULTS Data","potential logistics issues","severe influenza pandemic","individual surveys","focus group interviews","regulations","healthcare workers\u0027 perspectives","compliance","training","supplies of filtering facepiece respirators","noteworthy variation","actual clinical practice","development","preparation","sample","mean perception of safety","OBJECTIVES Predictions","thematic analysis","addition","structured guide","requirements","practical financial considerations","field study","key themes","preferences","event","CONCLUSIONS","extended period","scale"],"language":"en"},

The sample consisted of 2,359 patients (mean age = 55 \u00B1 13.7 years, 76.8% men, 59.3% Caucasian). RESULTS Comparative analysis revealed mortality did not differ from 2010 to 2014 (p = 0.653). Increases in comorbidities of atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, mechanical ventilation, body mass index \u2265 25, cerebrovascular disease, and mild liver disease were evidenced over the 5-year period (p values \u2264 0.049).

Thus far, this topic has received little systematic attention. AIM To summarise studies describing self-management strategies of patients with advanced cancer and associated experiences and personal characteristics. Also, to summarise attitudes of relatives and healthcare professionals towards patient self-management. DESIGN A systematic review including non-experimental quantitative and qualitative studies. Data were analysed using critical interpretive synthesis. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and quality of reporting. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and Google Scholar (until 11 June 2019). RESULTS Of 1742 identified articles, 31 moderate-quality articles describing 8 quantitative and 23 qualitative studies were included. Patients with advanced cancer used self-management strategies in seven domains: medicine and pharmacology, lifestyle, mental health, social support, knowledge and information, navigation and coordination and medical decision-making (29 articles). Strategies were highly individual, sometimes ambivalent and dependent on social interactions. Older patients and patients with more depressive symptoms and lower levels of physical functioning, education and self-efficacy might have more difficulties with certain self-management strategies (six articles). Healthcare professionals perceived self-management as desirable and achievable if based on sufficient skills and knowledge and solid patient-professional partnerships (three articles). CONCLUSION Self-management of patients with advanced cancer is highly personal and multifaceted. Strategies may be substitutional, additional or even conflicting compared to care provided by healthcare professionals. Self-management support can benefit from an individualised approach embedded in solid partnerships with relatives and healthcare professionals.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Dongen, Sophie I; de Nooijer, Kim; Cramm, Jane M; Francke, Anneke L; Oldenmenger, Wendy H; Korfage, Ida J; Witkamp, Frederika E; Stoevelaar, Rik; van der Heide, Agnes; Rietjens, Judith Ac","journal":"Palliative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216319883976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["self-management strategies of patients","patient self-management","Self-management support","CONCLUSION Self-management of patients","certain self-management strategies","self-efficacy","advanced cancer","healthcare professionals","Older patients","BACKGROUND Patients","moderate-quality articles","identified articles","qualitative studies","knowledge","solid partnerships","social support","methodological quality","quality of reporting","solid patient-professional partnerships","personal characteristics","attitudes of relatives","social interactions","systematic review","DATA SOURCES MEDLINE","little systematic attention","Cochrane Central","lifestyle","lower levels of physical functioning","depressive symptoms","mental health","CINAHL","PsycINFO","Embase","navigation","education","information","coordination","medicine","associated experiences","domains","difficulties","Web of Science","sufficient skills","pharmacology","individualised approach","medical decision-making","Google Scholar","critical interpretive synthesis","topic","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected and retrospectively analyzed. 15 (27.3%) of the patients had non-severe symptom, the mean age was 44.0 years (interquartile range 34.0-56.0), and median incubation period was 7.5 days (interquartile range 5.0-11.8). 26 (47.3%) patients had exposure history in Wuhan while 20 (36.4%) were associated with familial clusters. 18 (32.7%) had underlying comorbidities including hypertension. The most common symptoms of illness were fever (45, 81.8%), 51 (92.7%) patients had abnormal findings on chest CT. Laboratory findings showed that neutrophil count, percentage of lymphocyte, percentage of eosinophil, eosinophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and serum ferritin are potential risk factors for patients with poor prognosis. 26 patients (47.3%) were still hospitalized while 29 (52.7%) had been discharged at this point. Compared with patients in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Beijing are relatively mild.

A total of 200 one-day-old healthy broilers were allocated to two groups. The experimental group was fed a self-made low-Se diet (0.004 mg/kg) while the control group was fed a complete formula feed (0.2 mg/kg) for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 days, respectively. We observed histopathological changes in the chicken spleens. The messenger RNA(mRNA) expression levels of 8 kinds of ChTLRs, myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), toll-interleukine-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03B2 (TRIF), nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB), and cytokine (IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, IL-2, and IFN-\u03B3) were detected via quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression level of TLR4. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the correlation between the ChTLRs, MyD88, TRIF, and NF-\u03BAB. The results showed that the boundary between red pulp and white pulp was unclear, the number of lymphocytes decreased, and the nucleus was fragmented and dissolved in the experimental group at 25-55 days. At 15-45 days, the relative expression of TLR4 mRNA was higher than in the control group, and the difference was extremely significant on day 15 (P \u003C 0.01).The relative expression of TRIF mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 25-55 days, and the relative expression of NF-\u03BAB mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The relative expression of IL-6 mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The protein expression level of TLR4 in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The PCA results showed that there was a strong correlation between TLR4, TRIF, and component 1. The results suggest that TLR4 plays an important role in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleens of Se-deficient chickens, and Se deficiency may cause inflammatory injury through the TLR4/TRIF/NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway in chicken spleen.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ruili; Guo, Rong; Liu, Qing; Li, Guangxing; Sun, Bin; Huang, Xiaodan","journal":"Biological trace element research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02173-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental group","control group","days","relative expression of TLR4 mRNA","relative expression of TRIF mRNA","relative expression of NF","\u03BAB mRNA","NF-\u03BAB","relative expression of IL","protein expression level of TLR4","expression levels","expression of inflammatory cytokines","Se deficiency","spleens of Se","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","inflammatory spleen injury","inflammatory injury","spleen of chickens","PCA results","MyD88","chicken spleens","self-made low-Se diet","signal transduction pathway","myeloid differential protein","white pulp","red pulp","kinds of ChTLRs","receptor domain","deficient chickens","toll-interleukine","strong correlation","principal component analysis","day-old healthy broilers","boundary","interferon-\u03B2","adapter","effect of selenium","messenger RNA","difference","important role","relationship","number of lymphocytes","complete formula feed","TNF-\u03B1","present study","histopathological changes","quantitative real-time PCR","IFN-\u03B3","aim","groups","Western blotting","nucleus","total"],"language":"en"},

AIMS To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations, and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge. DESIGN A prospective cohort study. METHODS Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from February 3 to 21, 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks. RESULTS 53 (40.05%) patients on discharge had cough (29.01%), fatigue (7.63%), expectoration (6.11%), chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), chest pain (3.05%), and palpitation (1.53%). These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post discharge. Transient fever recurred in 11 (8.4%) patients. 78 (59.5%) discharged patients underwent chest CT and 2 (1.53%) showed deterioration. 94 (71.8%) patients received SARS-CoV-2 retest and 8 (6.10%) reported positive. 7 (2.29%) patients were re-admitted because of fever or positive SARS-CoV-2 retest. 121 (92.37%) and 4 (3.05%) patients were self-quarantined at home or community spots following discharge, with totally 167 closely contacted persons free of COVID-19 at the endpoint of study. CONCLUSIONS The majority of COVID-19 patients after discharge were in the course of recovery. Readmission was required in rare cases due to suspected recurrence of COVID-19. Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular reexamination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xingyu; Xu, Hao; Jiang, Haini; Wang, Liuming; Lu, Chao; Wei, Xiang; Liu, Jihong; Xu, Shuyun","journal":"QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["follow-up data of discharged patients","contacts of COVID","majority of COVID","BACKGROUND COVID","suspected recurrence of COVID","persons free of COVID","distribution of quarantine locations","clinical outcomes","appropriate self-quarantine","contacted infection","positive SARS-CoV","retest","chest tightness","chest CT","weeks","chest pain","symptoms","infection status","Transient fever","endpoint of study","Post-hospitalization data","prospective cohort study","regular reexamination","close contact history","global pandemic","home","rare cases","baseline characteristics","community spots","METHODS Demographics","cough","course of recovery","fatigue","Readmission","expectoration","dyspnea","CONCLUSIONS","Wuhan","China","medical records","RESULTS","palpitation","deterioration"],"language":"en"},

However, the screening of TCM is limited by the development cycle and laboratory conditions, which greatly limits the screening speed. This study established optimization docking models and virtual screening to discovery potential active herbs for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on molecular docking technology. The crystal structures of 3 CL protease(Mpro) and papain-like protease(PLP) were obtained from PDB database and homologous modeling respectively, and were used to conduct virtual screening of TCMD 2009 database by CDOCKER program. The ingredients scored in the top 100 were selected respectively, and the candidate herbs were ranked by the numbers of hit molecules. Based on Mpro inhibitors screening, 12 322 potential active components were obtained, and the representative active components included aster pentapeptide A, ligustrazine, salvianolic acid B, etc., and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Dianthi Herba, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Cistanches Herba were obtained. While 11 294 potential active ingredients were obtained by PLP inhibitor screening, representative active ingredients included gingerketophenol, ginkgol alcohol, ferulic acid, etc., and Codonopsis Radix, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Ginkgo Semen, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Trichosanthis Fructus, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Psoraleae Fructus, Sophorae Flavescentis Radix, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix were chosen. By combining the diagnosis and treatment scheme of Hunan province\u0027s and angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) inhibitors screening from literature, present study also discussed the rational application of candidate herbs to this epidemic situation. Trichosanthis Fructus obtained by PLP inhibitors screening and Fritillaria verticillata obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were parts of the Sangbei Zhisou Powder and Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, which might be applicable to the syndromes of cough and dyspnea. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma screened by Mpro and Trichosanthis Fructus screened by PLP were contained in Maxing Shigan Decoction and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, and could be applied to the syndromes of epidemic virus blocking lung. Mori Folium, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Forsythiae Fructus obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were included in the Sangju Decoction and Yinqiaosan, which might be applicable to the syndromes of warm pathogen attacking lung and cough and dyspnea. The results of this study are intended to provide a reference for the further development of traditional Chinese medicine to deal with the new epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Jing; Huo, Xiao-Qian; Chen, Xi; Zhu, Wei-Xing; Yao, Mei-Cun; Qiao, Yan-Jiang; Zhang, Yan-Ling","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200216.401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chuanxiong Rhizoma","Radix Alba","Mori Folium"],"organizations":["PLP","PDB","TCM","Rhei Radix et Rhizoma","Mpro and Trichosanthis Fructus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma","Rhei Radix et Rhizoma","Asteris Radix et Rhizoma","Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix","Chuanxiong Rhizoma","Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma","PLP inhibitors screening","Codonopsis Radix","ACE2 inhibitors screening","Mpro inhibitors screening","Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens","screening speed","PLP inhibitor screening","Sophorae Flavescentis Radix","Paeoniae Radix Alba","Angelicae Sinensis Radix","virtual screening of TCMD","Trichosanthis Fructus","potential active ingredients","representative active ingredients","potential active components","active role","representative active components","discovery potential active herbs","Forsythiae Fructus","Psoraleae Fructus","syndromes of epidemic virus","Xiaoxianxiong Decoction","Sangju Decoction","syndromes of cough","new epidemic","epidemic situation","Maxing Shigan Decoction","Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction","present study","development of traditional Chinese medicine","lung","protease","dyspnea","rational application of candidate herbs","syndromes of warm pathogen","Dianthi Herba","Cistanches Herba","ferulic acid","PDB database","development cycle","salvianolic acid B","molecular docking technology","treatment scheme of Hunan province\u0027s","gingerketophenol","Ginkgo Semen","prevention","Fritillaria verticillata","aster pentapeptide","ginkgol alcohol","Lonicerae Japonicae Flos","novel coronavirus","ligustrazine","angiotensin","Sangbei Zhisou Powder","enzyme","parts","models","literature","Mori Folium","diagnosis","optimization","papain","laboratory conditions","CDOCKER program","rapid outbreak of COVID","homologous modeling","Yinqiaosan","reference","numbers of hit molecules","crystal structures","results"],"language":"en"},

A controversial area concerns the safety of surgically created smoke and the perceived potential higher risk in laparoscopic surgery. METHODS The limited published evidence was analysed in combination with expert opinion. A review was undertaken of the novel coronavirus with regards to its hazards within surgical smoke and the procedures that could mitigate the potential risks to healthcare staff. RESULTS Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists. Best practice should consider the operating room set-up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID-19 operating protocol. The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery. Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non-filter devices, are discussed in detail. CONCLUSION There is not enough evidence to quantify the risks of COVID-19 transmission in surgical smoke. However, steps can be undertaken to manage the potential hazards.

All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analyzed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes\u0027 degrees in both January and June indicate a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness, resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Y; Huang, B; Shen, C; Cai, C; Wang, Y; Edwards, J; Zhang, G; Robertson, I D","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903722/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["trading network","mode network","connected counties","live pig market trade network","indirect contact network","social network analysis","major source counties","wholesale live pig markets","movement of live pigs","free-scale network property","truckloads of pigs","patterns of pig trade","potential magnitude","closeness","western regions of Guangdong Province","potential epidemic","higher betweenness","trade records","month study period","source county","total batches","piggeries","south China","epidemic spreading","movement pathways","impacts of different disease control strategies","targeted control interventions","higher clustering coefficient","Jiangxi","Fujian","Guangxi","primary objective","Hunan","Henan provinces","greater reduction","shorter average pathway length","distribution","nodes\u0027 degrees","Characteristics","results","Models","Maps","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We analysed patients with a histologically proven RCC (\u2264 7 cm) treated by MWA from April 2012-April 2018. Primary and secondary efficacy, local tumour recurrence (LTR), morbidity and mortality were reported. Efficacy was defined as no residual tumour enhancement on follow-up imaging 1 month after the first ablation (primary efficacy) and after re-ablation(s) for residual disease (secondary efficacy). Adverse events (AE) were registered by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the common terminology criteria for AE. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate a relation among pre-treatment factors incomplete ablation and complications. RESULTS In 100 patients, a total of 108 RCCs (85 T1a and 23 T1b) were treated by MWA. Median size was 3.2 cm (IQR 2.4-4.0). Primary efficacy was 89% (95%CI 0.81-0.94) for T1a lesions and 52% (95%CI 0.31-0.73) for T1b lesions (p \u003C 0.001). Fifteen lesions (7 T1a) were re-ablated for residual disease by MWA in one (n = 13) and two (n = 2, both T1b) sessions resulting in secondary efficacy rates of 99% (T1a) and 95% (T1b, p = 0.352).

To date, there is a paucity of patient selection criteria and prognosticators to facilitate decision making and enhance precious ICU capacity. METHODS Prospective study of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy (n = 12) over a 4-week period (March-April 2020). Association between preoperative and postoperative ventilation requirements and outcomes (ICU stay, time to decannulation, and death) were examined. RESULTS Patients who sustained FiO2 \u2264 50% and PEEP \u2264 8 cm H2 O in the 24 hours pretracheotomy exhibited a favorable outcome.

Randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, where rhBMP-2 was used in the reconstruction of human alveolar cleft were included. INTERVENTIONS Reconstruction of alveolar cleft with rhBMP-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Average bone volume formation and average bone height formation in the alveolar cleft. Mean difference was calculated and pooled by meta-analysis. RESULTS Of 709 identified articles, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. The average bone volume formation was higher in the rhBMP-2 group than in the control group (61.11% vs 59.12%). The average bone height formation was higher in the control group compared to the rhBMP-2 group (75.4% vs 61.5%). The risk of bias in the selected articles was high. The meta-analysis showed that rhBMP-2 treatment may benefit bone formation compared to iliac crest graft (low certainty evidence; mean difference: -208.76; 95% confidence interval: -253.59 to -163.93; -I2 = 0%).

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of persistence and the methods that enhance the neuroplasticity underlying persistence, remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the structural properties of the frontal pole cortex (FPC) before tasks contain information that can classify Achievers and Non-achievers (goal-directed persistence) participating in three tasks that differ in time scale (hours to months) and task domains (cognitive, language, and motor learning). We also found that most Achievers exhibit experience-dependent neuroplastic changes in the FPC after completing language and motor learning tasks. Moreover, we confirmed that a coaching strategy that used subgoals modified goal-directed persistence and increased the likelihood of becoming an Achiever. Notably, we discovered that neuroplastic changes in the FPC were facilitated by the subgoal strategy, suggesting that goal-striving, using effective coaching, optimizes the FPC for goal persistence.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosoda, Chihiro; Tsujimoto, Satoshi; Tatekawa, Masaru; Honda, Manabu; Osu, Rieko; Hanakawa, Takashi","journal":"Communications biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-0930-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["goal persistence","FPC","goal-striving","Persistent goal","neuroplasticity underlying persistence","motor learning tasks","underlying neural mechanisms of persistence","language","Non-achievers","coaching strategy","Achievers exhibit experience-dependent neuroplastic changes","effective coaching","subgoal strategy","months","methods","frontal pole cortex","hours","task domains","structural properties","time scale","behaviours","information","subgoals","achievements","fields","likelihood"],"language":"en"},

Here, the GBL flavonoids were isolated in two different manners and then examined for their bioactivity, physicochemical stability, and biocompatibility. The majority of flavonoids in the non-hydrolyzed and acidolyzed isolates, termed non-hydrolyzed isolate (NI) and acidolyzed isolate (AI) hereafter, were rich in flavonol glycosides and aglycones, respectively. Glycosidic/aglyconic quercetin and kaempferol were abundant in both NI and AI, whereas a little of apigenin, luteolin, and isorhamnetin were found in AI. NI was more thermostable in all pH ranges than quercetin, kaempferol, and AI. NI and AI both inhibited neurotransmitter release from differentiated neuronal PC-12 cells. NI and AI showed 1/2-1/3 lower EC50/CC50 values than quercetin and kaempferol. The NI and AI exhibited no toxicity assessed by the tests on chorioallantoic membranes of hen\u0027s eggs, removing toxicological concerns of irritation potential. Moreover, GBL isolates, particularly AI, showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in the use below the CC50 levels.

Endothelial cells participate in the formation of blood vessels and play an important role in the whole process of wound healing. Recent studies suggested that exosomes contribute to the intercellular communication through paracrine pathways, and sustained release of exosomes from hydrogel-based materials provide a promising strategy for curing wound defects. In this study, we isolated exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that HUVECs derived exosomes (HUVECs-Exos) could promote the proliferation and migration activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are two important effector cells for skin regeneration. Then we developed gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel as the wound dressing to incorporate HUVECs-Exos and applied it to the full-thickness cutaneous wounds. It demonstrated that GelMA scaffold could not only repair the wound defect, but also achieve sustained release of exosomes. The in vivo results showed accelerated re-epithelialization, promotion of collagen maturity and improvement of angiogenesis.

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed \u003E200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle\u0027s structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP\u0027s imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Capriotti, Annalaura; Piovesana, Susy; Chiozzi, Riccardo Zenezini; Montone, Carmela Maria; Bossi, Alessandra Maria; Lagan\u00E0, Aldo","journal":"Journal of proteomics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PC composition of nanoMIPs","proteins PC","set of nanoMIPs","nanoMIPs interactions","template protein","formation of protein corona","formed protein corona","PC iBAQ values","protein uptake","protein compositions","Type of protein","relative protein abundances","human plasma","plasma dilution","biological sample composition","crowded plasma sample","different proteins","small proteins","large proteins","correlation","selectivity","biological sample complexity","use of plastic antibodies","controls","molecular imprinting technique","molecular imprinting technology","relative abundances","imprinting process","molecular weight","Quantitative shotgun proteomics","nanoMIP\u0027s imprinted template","PCs","imprinted particles","fate of nanoparticles","fate of circulating nanoparticles","analytical uses","different dilutions","Proteomic study","diagnosis","natural receptors","nano-sized biomimetics","specificity","immunoglobulins","applications","nanoparticle\u0027s structure","depth insight","clinical practice","theranostic","drug delivery","effects","crosslinked polyacrylamide","times higher","present work","robustness of polymers","acrylamide derivatives","defensive response","iBAC","current challenge","translation","strong need","selection abilities","SIGNIFICANCE","high affinity"],"language":"en"},

Lyfe is defined as any system that fulfills all four processes of the living state, namely: dissipation, autocatalysis, homeostasis, and learning. Life is defined as the instance of lyfe that we are familiar with on Earth, one that uses a specific organometallic molecular toolbox to record information about its environment and achieve dynamical order by dissipating certain planetary disequilibria. This new classification system allows the astrobiological community to more clearly define the questions that propel their research-e.g., whether they are developing a historical narrative to explain the origin of life (on Earth), or a universal narrative for the emergence of lyfe, or whether they are seeking signs of life specifically, or lyfe at large across the universe.

Precise descriptions of the relations of city size and growth with population health metrics have not been systematically described. Describing these relationships can provide clues regarding the factors driving differences in health across cities. OBJECTIVE The goal of this scoping review is to map the existing evidence regarding the scaling properties of health outcomes, with a special emphasis on city size and growth. METHOD AND ANALYSIS We will conduct this scoping review based on a structured search of a combination of keywords for the exposures that aim to capture the population growth and size of cities along with degree of urbanisation, for health-related outcomes regardless of their type (incidence or prevalence of diseases and injuries and mortality). We will search the MEDLINE and Latin American \u0026 Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases from inception for studies in English, Spanish or Portuguese and perform manual searches of references and citations in the included studies. The search will be conducted from April 2019 to September 2019. We will report results using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. This review aims to inform future research on the role of increasing levels of urbanisation on health outcomes, provide clues into what city level factors may drive patterns of urban health and lead to the design and implementation of policies that promote sustainable growth and improved health. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will not collect any primary data and will rely on published articles. The findings of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.","publish_time":"2019-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCulley, Edwin M; Mullachery, Pricila; Rodriguez, Daniel; Diez Roux, Ana V; Bilal, Usama","journal":"BMJ open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEDLINE and Latin American \u0026 Caribbean Health Sciences Literature","ETHICS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["improved health","health effects of city","health-related outcomes","population health metrics","patterns of urban health","scaling properties of health outcomes","population growth","scoping review","relations of city size","Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases","sustainable growth","size of cities","city level factors","clues","world\u0027s population","structured search","degree of urbanisation","urban areas","included studies","published articles","role of increasing levels of urbanisation","inception","special emphasis","manual searches of references","prevalence of diseases","citations","English","incidence","type","implementation of policies","design","lead","existing evidence","future research","injuries","combination of keywords","MEDLINE","differences","Precise descriptions","primary data","results","PRISMA-ScR guidelines","mortality","exposures","peer","ANALYSIS","OBJECTIVE","goal","scientific journal","INTRODUCTION","ETHICS","DISSEMINATION","relationships","METHOD","findings"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCE A systematic search of electronic databases from 2008 to May 2018 included PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion criteria included an RCT design, samples of physicians and/or nurses, and publication year 2008 or later with outcomes targeting mental health, well-being/resiliency, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and/or physical health. Exclusion criteria included studies with a focus on burnout without measures of mood, resiliency, mindfulness, or stress; primary focus on an area other than health promotion; and non-English papers. DATA EXTRACTION Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from each study by 2 independent researchers using a standardized template created in Covidence. DATA SYNTHESIS Although meta-analytic pooling across all studies was desired, a wide array of outcome measures made quantitative pooling unsuitable. Therefore, effect sizes were calculated and a mini meta-analysis was completed. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies (N = 2708 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated that mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy-based interventions are effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Brief interventions that incorporate deep breathing and gratitude may be beneficial. Visual triggers, pedometers, and health coaching with texting increased physical activity.

We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. RESULTS Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided. CONCLUSION Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Saverio, Salomone; Pata, Francesco; Gallo, Gaetano; Carrano, Francesco; Scorza, Antonella; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Smart, Neil; Spinelli, Antonino; Pellino, Gianluca","journal":"Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","Specific procedures","current COVID","transmission of COVID","management of patients","elective colorectal surgery","specific aspects of colorectal surgery","colorectal conditions","colorectal emergencies","invasive surgery","proctological procedures","non-cancer procedures","healthcare professionals","healthcare staff","specific rules","Italy","policies","high volumes of surgical patients","challenging healthcare systems","pathways of emergency","administrative management","operating building","CONCLUSION Evidence","practical strategy","urgent cancer treatment","limited evidence available","exit","dedicated personal protective equipment","theatres","strict regulation of entry","experience","global level","reorganization of health system","conservative approach","risks","exposure","crisis","areas","advice","local levels","METHOD","authors","Lessons","Tasks","Endoscopy","description","key-points","rapid spread","virus","RESULTS","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

An 18-year-old healthy female presented with symptoms of recurrent subacute small bowel obstruction and right paraduodenal hernia was diagnosed on computed tomography (CT). Laparoscopic repair was performed with reinforcement of suture repair with GORE\u00AE BIO-A\u00AE Hiatal Tissue Reinforcement to decrease the risk of recurrence. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the second post-operative day. Subsequent follow-up revealed complete resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION Biosynthetic tissue reinforcement carries a lower theoretical risk of erosion than permanent mesh. A hiatal-shaped prosthesis represents a suitable shape for paraduodenal hernia repair. CONCLUSION We present the first reported use of bioabsorbable mesh to repair paraduodenal hernia. This technique may minimise risk of mesh erosion and can be considered a safe and effective approach where suture repair is inadequate due to large defect size.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwan, Bianca; Theodore, Jane E; Wong, Jason","journal":"International journal of surgery case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.03.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["paraduodenal hernia repair","laparoscopic repair of paraduodenal hernia","reinforcement of suture repair","right paraduodenal hernia","hernia defect","surgical repair","risk of mesh erosion","biosynthetic mesh","permanent mesh","risk of recurrence","INTRODUCTION Paraduodenal hernias","Hiatal Tissue Reinforcement","common type of internal hernia","suture closure","lower theoretical risk of erosion","DISCUSSION Biosynthetic tissue reinforcement","high risk of incarceration","rare cause of bowel obstruction","reported use of bioabsorbable mesh","symptoms of recurrent subacute small bowel obstruction","novel technique","complete resolution of symptoms","hiatal-shaped prosthesis","large defect size","suitable shape","associated mortality","effective approach","GORE","computed tomography","Subsequent follow-up","year-old healthy female","PRESENTATION OF CASE","patient","uneventful recovery","post-operative day","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate the impact of treatment (radiation therapy \u00B1 concurrent chemotherapy) on (i) muscle strength, muscle cross-sectional area and patient-reported outcomes, and (ii) central and peripheral alterations during a whole-body exercise task. METHODS Ten people with head and neck cancer (4 female; 50 \u00B1 9 years) completed a lab visit before and after (56 \u00B1 30 days) completion of treatment. Participants performed a neuromuscular assessment (involving maximal isometric voluntary contractions in the knee extensors and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve) before and during intermittent cycling to volitional exhaustion. Anthropometrics and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS From before to after treatment, maximal isometric muscle strength was reduced (P = 0.002, d = 0.73), as was potentiated twitch force (P \u003C 0.001, d = 0.62), and muscle cross-sectional area (e.g., vastus lateralis: P = 0.010, d = 0.64). Exercise time was reduced (P = 0.008, d = 0.62) and peripheral processes contributed to a reduction in maximal force due to cycling. After treatment, the severity of self-reported fatigue increased (P = 0.041, r = - 0.65) and health-related quality of life decreased (P = 0.012, r = - 0.79). CONCLUSION Neuromuscular function was impaired in patients with head and neck cancer after treatment. Whole-body exercise tolerance was reduced and resulted in predominantly peripheral, rather than central, disturbances to the neuromuscular system. Future research should evaluate strength training after treatment for head and neck cancer, with the overall aim of reducing fatigue and improving health-related quality of life.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavigne, Colin; Lau, Harold; Francis, George; Culos-Reed, S Nicole; Millet, Guillaume Y; Twomey, Rosie","journal":"European journal of applied physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04362-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neck cancer","head","impact of treatment","PURPOSE Treatment","completion of treatment","reduced health-related quality of life","maximal isometric muscle strength","muscle cross-sectional area","maximal force","strength training","CONCLUSION Neuromuscular function","neuromuscular assessment","peripheral alterations","neuromuscular system","peripheral processes","whole-body exercise task","outcomes","Whole-body exercise tolerance","Exercise time","maximal isometric voluntary contractions","severity of self-reported fatigue","impaired physical function","intermittent cycling","potentiated twitch force","knee extensors","loss of body mass","patients","electrical stimulation","femoral nerve","effects","radiation therapy","reduction","vastus lateralis","concurrent chemotherapy","overall aim","disturbances","female","people","Future research","volitional exhaustion","METHODS","years","Participants","Anthropometrics","days","lab","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that the anticancer activity of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors results not only from their ability to block the cell cycle in malignant cells but also from a range of immunostimulatory effects.

This is done in the context of both simulated data, and data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.

This study is aimed to introduce and review a series of LOAGB cases that had to be reversed to normal anatomy due to severe hypoalbuminemia and its related symptoms after a few months. METHODS Patients who had LOAGB from 2014 to 2018 and then reversed after some months were included in this study. Their first and second surgical data were collected and reviewed for important and relevant information. RESULTS From 846 cases of LOAGB, 12 patients reversed after a mean of 12.1 months. All of them were women with mean age of 46 years. All of the gastrojejunostomy anastomosis had been made 200 cm after the Treitz ligament, and all of the patients had at least 250 cm common channel. The mean excess body mass index loss before the reversal surgery was 107.7%. None patients lost or died during the study. CONCLUSION Regarding anastomosis, 200 cm from Treitz ligament is not suitable for all of the patients and common channel more than 250 cm cannot prevent hypoalbuminemia. The surgeon should decide as quickly as possible whether his/her patients need reversal surgery or not. Appropriate patients should be selected for LOAGB.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keleidari, Behrouz; Mahmoudieh, Mohsen; Shahabi, Shahab; Sheikhbahaei, Erfan; Rezaei, Mohammadtaghi; Sayadi, Masoud; Melali, Hamid","journal":"World journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05290-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31873804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["METHODS Patients","Appropriate patients","cases of LOAGB","months","study","series of LOAGB cases","mean age","reversal surgery","gastrojejunostomy anastomosis","Treitz ligament","common channel","anastomosis gastric bypass","severe hypoalbuminemia","mean excess body mass index loss","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic","related symptoms","normal anatomy","women","years","relevant information","RESULTS","surgical data","surgeon","CONCLUSION","circumstances"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here, we detailed how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also made all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrated how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles could be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crawford, Katharine H D; Eguia, Rachel; Dingens, Adam S; Loes, Andrea N; Malone, Keara D; Wolf, Caitlin R; Chu, Helen Y; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Veesler, David; Murphy, Michael; Pettie, Deleah; King, Neil P; Balazs, Alejandro B; Bloom, Jesse D","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BEI Resources","ATCC","NIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","pseudotyped lentiviral particles","Spike protein","pseudotype biosafety-level","convenient luciferase-based assays","single-cycle lentiviral","viral infection","key experimental reagents available","neutralizing activity of human sera","main target of neutralizing antibodies","T cells","ELISA-based methods","vesicular stomatitis virus","BEI Resources repository of ATCC","plasma","valuable complement","VSV","antibody binding","NIH","immunity","way","protocols","receptor","neutralization","ACE2","pseudotyping"],"language":"en"},

Ten healthy subjects were tested. Electrodes were positioned over the midline (Oz, Iz, CBz) and at 3, 6 and 9 cm intervals lateral to the midline electrodes bilaterally. Additional electrodes were also positioned over posterior neck muscles (SPL1 and SPL2). The largest evoked potentials on average were recorded from the electrodes 3 and 6 cm lateral to the Iz and CBz midline locations. BC stimuli produced short latency potentials on the side contralateral to the stimulated mastoid and were dependent on stimulus polarity. Positive polarity stimuli produced biphasic VsCEPs at approximately 12 and 17 ms (P12-N17) for BC impulses and 10 and 15 ms (P10-N15) for BC 500 Hz stimuli. Following the initial excitation, there was a period of suppression of background activity lasting an average of 16.8 ms for positive polarity BC impulses. Negative polarity stimuli produced later VsCEPs both for BC impulses (P20-N26) and BC 500 Hz (P13-N18). VsCEPs to AC 500 Hz stimuli lateralised to the contralateral side and were larger for right than left ear stimulation. Stimulus polarity (condensation and rarefaction) did not alter the timing of the VsCEPs to AC 500 Hz tones. No evoked response was recorded to somatosensory (median and radial nerve) stimulation. Four patients with cerebellar disease were tested and two showed abnormal VsCEPs with initial negativities. VsCEPs show distinct mapping over the posterior fossa and are likely to reflect climbing fibre responses via crossed otolith-cerebellar pathways.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Govender, Sendhil; Todd, Neil P M; Colebatch, James G","journal":"Experimental brain research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-020-05733-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BC stimuli","Hz stimuli","Positive polarity stimuli","positive polarity BC impulses","abnormal VsCEPs","biphasic VsCEPs","Hz tones","Negative polarity stimuli","stimulus polarity","midline electrodes","ms","Hz acoustic tones","Vestibular cerebellar evoked potentials","cerebellar regions","cerebellar disease","Additional electrodes","largest evoked potentials","average","evoked response","CBz midline locations","Iz","lateral","crossed otolith-cerebellar pathways","short latency potentials","posterior fossa","initial negativities","initial excitation","posterior neck muscles","left ear stimulation","climbing fibre responses","scalp","bone","mastoids","P20-N26","period of suppression","background activity","stimulated mastoid","radial nerve","SPL1","SPL2","rarefaction","distinct mapping","P12-N17","P10-N15","impulsive accelerations","occipital","condensation","timing","P13-N18","patients","intervals","healthy subjects"],"language":"en"},

The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported but there is no consensus on their patterns. Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centers from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms. The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively. Our data revealed different pattern of seroconversion among these groups. All 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.

We aimed to examine whether patients infected by community transmission had extended incubation periods than the early generation patients who had direct exposures to Wuhan. METHODOLOGY Based on 4741 patient case reports from municipal centers of disease control by February 21, 2020, we calculated the incubation periods of 2555 patients with clear epidemiological survey information and illness development timeline. All patients were categorized into five groups by their travel histories. Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation. RESULTS Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China. The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories. Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days. CONCLUSIONS The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan.

It creates DNA double-strand breaks causing cell death in highly replicating tumour cells. However, tumours can develop acquired resistance to therapy. The efficiency of radiation treatment has been increased by means of combining it with other approaches such as chemotherapy, molecule-targeted therapies and, in recent years, immunotherapy. Cancer-cell apoptosis after radiation treatment causes an immunological reaction that contributes to eradicate the tumour via antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. On the other hand, radiotherapy also contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive environment that hinders the efficacy of the therapy. Innate immune cells from myeloid and lymphoid origin show a very active role in both acquired resistance and anti-tumorigenic mechanisms. Therefore, many efforts are being made in order to reach a better understanding of the innate immunity reactions after radiation therapy and the design of new combinatorial immunotherapy strategies focused in these particular populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, Valent\u00ED; Mustapha, Rami; Ng, Kenrick; Ng, Tony","journal":"British journal of clinical pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Radiation therapy","efficiency of radiation treatment","Cancer-cell apoptosis","cell death","resistance","curative cancer treatment regimens","Innate immune cells","replicating tumour cells","subsequent T-cell activation","essential component of cancer care","innate immunity reactions","design of new combinatorial immunotherapy strategies","lymphoid origin","antigen presentation","better understanding","DNA double-strand breaks","molecule-targeted therapies","active role","chemotherapy","recent years","immunological reaction","particular populations","anti-tumorigenic mechanisms","formation","immunosuppressive environment","order","efficacy","radiotherapy","approaches","tumours","hand","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Current researches on COVID-19 continue to highlight the necessity for further understanding the virus-host synergies. In this study, we have highlighted the key cytokines induced by coronavirus infections. We have demonstrated that genes coding interleukins (Il-1\u03B1, Il-1\u03B2, Il-6, Il-10), chemokine (Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5, Ccl10), and interferon (Ifn-\u03B12, Ifn-\u03B21, Ifn2) upsurge significantly which in line with the elevated infiltration of T cells, NK cells and monocytes in SARS-Cov treated group at 24 hours.

Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is inherently spatial, that is, performed at points of need, and also intrinsically temporal, because it produces fast actionable results. Outbreaks generate geospatial \u0022hotspots.\u0022 POC strategies help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. Objectives. To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. Data Sources. PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter. Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles. More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount. Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources. Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kost, Gerald J","journal":"Archives of pathology \u0026 laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0172-ra; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC"],"locations":["Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["care testing","care tests results","COVID","POC geospatial strategies","geospatial science articles","crisis standards of care","emergency response","national emergency","onsite diagnostic testing","site of patient care","outbreak control","community resilience","POC strategies help","Conclusions POCT","hotspots","geospatial-associated concepts","hotspot articles","spread","pandemic","Outbreaks","fast actionable results","outbreak surges","disease detection","national cloud databases help","times of crisis","human","mitigation","contagion containment","decision making","chapters","documents","schematics","public health practitioners","epidemics","principles","Clarivate Analytics","email","abstracts","diminishing risk","Wuhan","papers","maps","flowcharts","spirals of dysfunction","infected individuals","multidisciplinary healthcare personnel","speed treatment","Asia","literature","PDFs","governments","relevance","cultural losses mount","Coverage","interviews","infectious diseases","EndNote X9","ULRs","newsprint","Europe","needs","death","PubMed","WWW","delays","epicenter","points of need","Data Sources"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. RESULTS More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged \u003C25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the CDC\u0027s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared to 25% in March 2019. CONCLUSIONS This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.

The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, many patients can be asymptomatic, thus increasing the uncertainty of the diagnostic work-up. Laboratory tests play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the current gold standard being real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens. However, the diagnostic accuracy of rRT-PCR depends on many pre-analytical and analytical variables. The measurement of specific COVID-19 antibodies (both IgG and IgM) should serve as an additional, non-invasive tool for disease detection and management. Methods The imprecision of the MAGLUMI\u2122 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM and IgG assays (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) was assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A3 protocol. Linearity of dilution and recovery was evaluated by means of mixes of high-level pools and low-level pools of serum samples. Immunoglobulin time kinetics were evaluated using a series of serum samples, repeatedly collected from COVID-19-positive patients at different times, from \u003C5 days up to 26-30 days. Results Findings at the analytical validation of the assay carried out according to the CLSI EP15-A3 guideline demonstrated that imprecision and repeatability were acceptable (repeatability was \u003C4% and \u003C6% for IgM and IgG, respectively, whilst intermediate imprecision was \u003C6%). In addition, results of dilution and recovery studies were satisfactory. The kinetics of COVID-19 antibodies confirmed previously reported findings, showing a rapid increase of both IgM and IgG after 6-7 days from the symptom onset. IgG had 100% sensitivity on day 12, whilst 88% was the higher positive rate achieved for IgM after the same time interval. Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies. These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Padoan, Andrea; Cosma, Chiara; Sciacovelli, Laura; Faggian, Diego; Plebani, Mario","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute","CLSI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","kinetics of COVID","sera of COVID","measurement of specific COVID","IgG assays","measurement of specific IgM","nCov IgM","positive patients","days","Results Findings","appropriate utilization of specific antibodies","rRT-PCR","disease detection","diagnosis","repeatability","reported findings","analytical validation","MAGLUMI","results of dilution","analytical variables","intermediate imprecision","Immunoglobulin time kinetics","China","CLSI EP15-A3 guideline","low-level pools of serum samples","EP15-A3 protocol","diagnostic accuracy of rRT","series of serum samples","Background Coronavirus disease","pre-requisite","CLIA assay","recovery studies","Laboratory tests","Linearity of dilution","clinical spectrum","valuable data","diagnostic work","time interval","mixes of high-level pools","Laboratory Standards Institute","respiratory tract specimens","higher positive rate","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","current gold standard","Snibe","non-invasive tool","pivotal role","rapid increase","study","validity","Shenzhen","different times","initial reports","emerging health threat","uncertainty","addition","symptom onset","Conclusions","sensitivity","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients \u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henry, Brandon Michael; Oliveira, Maria Helena S","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8360b0e64d444215d21a61e056b070f12417e53.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029884","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Pediatric cases of COVID","number of cases","international cases","number of reported cases","international pediatric COVID","medical care","crowdsourced data","days","median age","outside China","preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients","limited data","children","data sharing","IQR","years of age","median delay","mainland China","median reporting delay","rate of travel","mortality rate","symptoms onset","Secondary outcomes","primary outcomes","Tertiary outcomes","adolescent age groups","cumulative case counts","females","early analysis of epidemiologic variables","rate of infected family members","symptom onset","rates of symptoms","subgroup analyses","study period","male skew","observational study","common presentation","male predominance","line list crowdsourced online databases","outbreak of coronavirus disease","Wuhan","open-access","Methods","fever","comparison","adults","adolescents","time","Background","date","laboratory","Hubei","location","respect","clinical features","course","diagnosis","Results","total","infections","information","Conclusions","start","cough","world"],"language":"en"},

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast the epidemics, these classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here we propose a data-driven, parameter-free approach to access the fragility and systemic risk of epidemic networks by studying the Forman-Ricci curvature. Network curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can be translated for COVID-19 epidemic time series as well. We first show that our hypothesis is true in a toy-model of epidemic time series with delays, which generates epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Forman-Ricci curvature can be a parameter-free estimate for the fragility and risk of the network at each stage of the simulated pandemic. On this basis, we then compute the Forman-Ricci curvature for real epidemic networks built from epidemic time series available from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Forman-Ricci curvature allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of the method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for epidemics, without the need of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling. The strategy above, together with other data-driven tools for investigating epidemic network dynamics, can be readily implemented on a daily basis to quickly estimate the growth, risk and fragility of real COVID-19 epidemic networks at different scales.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Souza, Danillo Barros; Santos, Fernando A N; Figueiroa, Everlon; Correia, Jailson B; da Silva, Hernande P; Filho, Jose Luiz de Lima; Albuquerque, Jones","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd145d3e714c277c0b2b90d6cd58901fdaee59d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real epidemic networks","systemic risk of epidemic networks","Forman-Ricci curvature","epidemic network dynamics","Network curvature","epidemic time series available","financial networks","fragility of real COVID","parameter-free estimate","parameter estimations","parameter-free approach","need of parameter estimation","epidemics","data-driven tools","early geometrical data marker","numerous classical epidemiology models","epidemiology metrics","classical approaches","different scales","simulated pandemic","unprecedented scales","daily basis","early warning signs","toy-model","delays","contagion rate","World Health Organization","growth","basic reproduction number","novel Coronavirus disease","emergence","stochastic modeling","stage","damage","method","hypothesis","results","advantage","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Data sources Databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched for 6TG and synonyms from 1998\u20132018. Methods We included studies of patients with ALL or inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) treated with 6TG, excluding studies with 6TG as part of an intensive chemotherapy regimen. We uploaded a protocol to PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018089424). Database and manual searches yielded 1823 unique records. Of these, 395 full-texts were screened for eligibility. Finally, 134 reports representing 42 studies were included. Results and conclusions We included data from 42 studies of ALL and IBD patients; four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 3,993 patients, 20 observational studies including 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. Hepatotoxicity in the form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) occurred in 9\u201325% of the ALL patients in two of the four included RCTs using 6TG doses of 40\u201360 mg/m2/day, and long-term hepatotoxicity in the form of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was reported in 2.5%. In IBD patients treated with 6TG doses of approximately 23 mg/m2/day, NRH occurred in 14% of patients; SOS has not been reported.

According to this review, doses at or below 12 mg/m2/day are rarely associated with notable hepatotoxicity and can probably be considered safe.","publish_time":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toksvang, Linea Natalie; Schmidt, Magnus Str\u00F8h; Arup, Sofie; Larsen, Rikke Hebo; Frandsen, Thomas Leth; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Rank, Cecilie Utke","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90a054e5ceab1958565e8946fccc1920131524e8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/535518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies of patients","IBD patients","TG doses","day","m2","risk of hepatotoxicity","incidence of hepatotoxicity","observational studies","included RCTs","reference lists of included studies","long-term hepatotoxicity","notable hepatotoxicity","NRH","SOS","background incidence","safe dose of continuous","established association","case reports","lower relapse risk","incorporated thioguanine nucleotides","Data sources Databases","form of nodular regenerative hyperplasia","form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome","higher levels of DNA","conference proceedings","childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","randomised controlled trials","inflammatory bowel disorder","manual searches","protocol","PROSPERO","registration number CRD42018089424","unique records","reassessment of prolonged","conclusions","treatment","intensive chemotherapy regimen","Results","Objectives","Methods","texts","eligibility","review","synonyms"],"language":"en"},

Human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged in East China in March 2013. In contrast to seasonal influenza A viruses, H7N9 infections showed a strong sex bias. Over the five epidemic waves in China, ~70% of all H7N9 cases were observed in men. Thus, in this human cohort, we retrospectively analyzed sex hormones as well as inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in men and women infected with avian H7N9 influenza. Methods. We systematically analyzed the underlying correlation based on established human cohorts of two age groups (18-49 years and [\u2265]50 years) including laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases as well as seasonal influenza cases, H7N9 close contacts and poultry workers as controls in dependency on sex. The level of testosterone, estradiol and cytokines/chemokines were measured in all study participants. We compared the levels of sex hormones, cytokines/chemokines by sex and disease outcome. Findings. We included H7N9 cases (n=98), close contacts (n=71), poultry workers (n=108) and mild seasonal influenza cases (n=53) in this study. Samples were collected between 2014 and 2017. All control groups showed similar median age within H7N9 cases except for the seasonal influenza group with a younger median age. In H7N9 infected men, testosterone levels were strongly reduced compared to male H7N9 virus-negative close contacts or males with seasonal influenza. Low testosterone levels in H7N9 infected men correlated with high inflammatory cytokine levels, e.g. IL-6, and lethal outcome in those 18-49 years of age. No significant differences were detected in estradiol levels in H7N9 infected men. In H7N9 infected women ([\u2265] 50 years), estradiol levels were significantly elevated compared to H7N9 virus-negative close contacts. However, increased estradiol levels did not significantly correlate with lethal outcome in women albeit a slight tendency towards poor outcome could be detected. Interpretation. This study provides evidence that low testosterone levels in H7N9 influenza infected men correlate with inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses and lethal outcome. Thus, treatment of H7N9 influenza virus infected patients should consider sex-specific mitigation strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Y.; Bai, T.; Beck, S.; Stanelle-Bertram, S.; Chen, T.; Dong, J.; Yang, J.; Wang, L.; Wang, D.; Shu, Y.; Gabriel, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4b0a5b06fc978e667006a4b0a9b5cb00c8c1498.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20093914v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["East China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 cases","H7N9 infected men","H7N9 influenza infected men","avian H7N9 influenza","H7N9 infections","H7N9 infected women","H7N9 close contacts","treatment of H7N9 influenza virus infected patients","levels of sex hormones","avian influenza","chemokine levels","mild seasonal influenza cases","male H7N9 virus-negative close contacts","seasonal influenza group","Low testosterone levels","increased estradiol levels","high inflammatory cytokine levels","lethal outcome","years of age","age groups","poor outcome","disease outcome","strong sex bias","level of testosterone","Human infections","similar median age","younger median age","sex-specific mitigation strategies","chemokines","cytokines","poultry workers","study participants","established human cohorts","chemokine responses","control groups","East China","controls","viruses","males","slight tendency","evidence","underlying correlation","dependency","significant differences","contrast","laboratory","epidemic waves","Methods","Findings","Samples","Interpretation","Background"],"language":"en"},

As a result all elective surgeries, procedures, and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has impacted the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice.

Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance, but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited. OBJECTIVES Our objective was to estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1,062 locations from 1990 to 2019. RESULTS Despite overall improvements from 1990 {33.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 31.5, 35.6] without access} to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (95% UI: 1.91, 2.14) billion people, 26.1% (95% UI: 24.7, 27.7) of the global population, lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, and in eight countries, 50 million or more persons lacked access. DISCUSSION For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, and disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7200.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brauer, Michael; Zhao, Jeff T; Bennitt, Fiona B; Stanaway, Jeffrey D","journal":"Environmental health perspectives","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp7200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Risk Factors Study"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Oceania"],"keyphrases":["handwashing access","global access","handwashing facilities","effectiveness of handwashing","handwashing station","use of handwashing","water","available soap","global population","BACKGROUND Low-income countries","high-income countries","reduction of transmission","higher COVID","prevention of COVID","transmission of respiratory viruses","high population densities","Global Burden of Diseases","immediate improvements","overall improvements","Risk Factors Study","spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling","context","observational surveys","Injuries","health care system capacity","social distancing","paramount importance","populations","Oceania","alternative strategies","case fatality rates","key component of guidance","SARS-CoV","sub-Saharan Africa","forecasting models","Prior systematic reviews","METHODS","locations","disparities","DISCUSSION","RESULTS","uncertainty interval","OBJECTIVES","pandemic","persons","people"],"language":"en"},

In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19. These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases.

We aim to determine whether new-onset STD are more frequent among Covid-19 patients than influenza patients. METHODS Case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centers. Consecutive patients positive for Covid-19 PCR (cases) and patients positive for influenza PCR (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between both groups. New-onset STD were significantly more frequent among cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %), adjusted OR 21.4 (2.77-165.4, p=0.003). Covid-19 patients with new-onset STD were significantly younger than Covid-19 patients without STD (52.6 \u00B1 17.2 vs. 67.4 \u00B115.1, p\u003C0,001). Among Covid-19 patients who presented STD, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%), and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction.

Rapid first-line testing protocols are needed for outbreak control and surveillance. METHODS We used computational and manual design to generate a suitable set of reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) primer and exonuclease probe, internally quenched (exo-IQ) probe sequences targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. RT-RPA sensitivity was determined by amplification of in vitro transcribed RNA standards. Assay selectivity was demonstrated with a selectivity panel of 32 nucleic acid samples derived from common respiratory viruses. To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened. All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays. RESULTS The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87 - 27.39) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance. The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n=20). CONCLUSION With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple to use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Behrmann, Ole; Bachmann, Iris; Spiegel, Martin; Schramm, Marina; El Wahed, Ahmed Abd; Dobler, Gerhard; Dame, Gregory; Hufert, Frank T","journal":"Clinical chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384153/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed RT-RPA assay","RT-RPA sensitivity","Assay selectivity","full-length SARS-CoV","reported assay","RNA copies","established RT-qPCR assays","results","current outbreak of SARS","total viral RNA","high RNA concentrations","transcribed RNA standards","nucleic acid samples","amplification of","minutes","fastest nucleic acid based detection methods","common respiratory viruses","exonuclease probe","probe sequences","respiratory viruses of clinical significance","selectivity panel","detection probability","outbreak control","line screening","screened coronaviruses","diagnostic sensitivity","N gene","nasopharyngeal swab samples","line testing protocols","suitable set of reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification","cell culture supernatant","primer","exo-IQ","manual design","specificity","cross-reactivity","run time","point of need","BACKGROUND","alternative","date","confirmed cases","CONCLUSION","surveillance","reaction","country","deaths"],"language":"en"},

We explored the association of serum selenium levels in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and preterm birth among Chinese women. We included 398 women with a singleton pregnancy, who were followed up prospectively from the first prenatal visit until delivery. Serum selenium levels were measured in the first trimester. After delivery, data concerning mothers and their children were sourced from medical records by researchers who were blind to the participants\u0027 selenium status. Of the 398 women, 71 (17.8%) had GDM, 21(5.3%) had preterm birth, and 266 (66.8%) had selenium deficiency (serum selenium \u003C 70 \u03BCg/L). Women in the upper three quartiles of serum selenium level did not have a significantly lower risk of GDM or preterm birth than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates (all p \u003E 0.05). When serum selenium levels were classified as normal or deficient, the risk of GDM or preterm birth among women with normal serum selenium levels was still not lower than that of women with deficient serum selenium levels after adjustment for covariates (all p \u003E 0.05). Although selenium deficiency was common in the Chinese women in our cohort, our results indicate that low serum selenium level during early pregnancy may not be a strong predictor of the risk of GDM and preterm birth. However, our sample size was small, and future studies with larger populations are warranted.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Peng Ju; Yao, Aimin; Ma, Liangkun; Chen, Xiao Yan; Yu, Song Lin; Liu, Yanping; Hou, Yi Xuan","journal":"Biological trace element research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02191-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower serum selenium levels","normal serum selenium levels","deficient serum selenium levels","association of serum selenium levels","selenium deficiency","low serum selenium level","quartiles of serum selenium level","preterm birth","Chinese women","participants\u0027 selenium status","lower risk of GDM","early pregnancy","adjustment","covariates","singleton pregnancy","delivery","blind","results","future studies","healthy controls","lowest quartile","strong predictor","gestational diabetes mellitus","children","medical records","researchers","cohort","sample size","larger populations","data","mothers","\u03BCg","prenatal visit","trimester"],"language":"en"},

In a first experiment, vaccinated chickens were challenged with an IBV Ark99-type virulent strain (AL/4614/98). Despite extensive sequence similarity between the vaccines, the more heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI was more efficient at reducing viral loads in challenged chickens, while respiratory signs and tracheal lesions were reduced similarly by either vaccine. A distinct subpopulation of the Ark challenge virus showing asparagine at S1 position 56 was consistently negatively selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination with either vaccine. Antibody levels and antibody avidity to Ark-type S1 protein were greater in CEK-ArkDPI-vaccinated chickens compared to chickens vaccinated with the more diverse commercial ArkDPI vaccine. Synchronous replication of a homogeneous virus population likely elicits clonal expansion and affinity maturation of a greater number of responding B cells compared to a diverse virus population continuously changing its proportion of phenotypes during replication. The results of a second experiment showed that during initial vaccine virus replication (24 and 48 hr postvaccination), the virus population showing increased diversity (commercial ArkDPI) achieved higher concentrations of IBV RNA in the trachea compared to the more homogenous virus. mRNA expression of genes associated with innate immune responses in the trachea 48 hr postvaccination generally showed greater upregulation in chickens vaccinated with the heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI vaccine compared to the CEK-adapted virus. The greater upregulation of these genes is likely associated with higher virus replication achieved by the heterogeneous commercial vaccine. Thus, while the adaptive antibody response was favored by the more homogenous structure of the CEK-ArkDPI vaccine population (higher antibody levels and antibody avidity), the innate immune response was favored by the more diverse viral population of the commercial ArkDPI. We confirmed previous results that distinct subpopulations in wild Ark challenge virus become selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination, and we concluded that the population structure of IBV vaccines impacts innate immune response, antibody avidity, and protection.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zegpi, R A; Joiner, K S; van Santen, V L; Toro, H","journal":"Avian diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.1.60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Delmarva Poultry Industry","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEK-ArkDPI vaccine population","diverse commercial ArkDPI vaccine","heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI vaccine","diverse virus population","homogeneous virus population","heterogeneous commercial vaccine","type vaccine","initial vaccine virus replication","homogenous virus","higher virus replication","homogeneous population","CEK-adapted virus","antibody avidity","vaccinated chickens","diverse viral population","wild Ark challenge virus","immune pressure","commercial Arkansas","higher antibody levels","innate immune responses","challenged chickens","population structure of IBV vaccines impacts","adaptive antibody response","impact of population genetic structure","generation of immune responses","greater upregulation","Ark-type S1 protein","greater number","homogenous structure","Synchronous replication","higher concentrations of IBV RNA","hr postvaccination","protection","experiment","IBV Ark99-type virulent strain","distinct subpopulations","B cells","S1 position","viral loads","previous results","mRNA expression of genes","clonal expansion","chicken embryo kidney","Delmarva Poultry Industry","respiratory signs","affinity maturation","increased diversity","adaptation","asparagine","tracheal lesions","proportion of phenotypes","extensive sequence similarity","model"],"language":"en"},

Here, we used 24-channel NIRS to examine the characteristics of prefrontal hemodynamic responses during a verbal fluency task in 20 adults with ASD and in age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls. In addition, we used Spearman\u0027s correlation analysis to identify the relationship between the time-course of prefrontal hemodynamic activation and the current suicide risk in patients with ASD. We found no significant differences between the verbal fluency task-induced prefrontal hemodynamic responses in the ASD vs. control group.

Though various intubation devices have been demonstrated to perform well in oral endotracheal intubation, limited information is available concerning nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in patients with cervical spine immobilization. The present study compared the performance of the C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope with the McCoy laryngoscope for NTI in patients with simulated cervical spine injuries. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, study done in a tertiary hospital. Ninety-five patients requiring NTI were included in data analysis: McCoy group (group M, n = 47) or C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope group (group C, n = 48). A Philadelphia neck collar was applied before anesthetic induction to immobilize the cervical spine. Single experienced anesthesiologist performed NTI. The primary outcome was duration of intubation divided by three steps: nose to oropharynx; oropharynx into glottic inlet; and glottic inlet to trachea. Secondary outcomes included glottic view as percentage of glottis opening (POGO) score and Cormack-Lehance (CL) grade, modified nasal intubation-difficulty scale (NIDS) rating, hemodynamic changes before and after intubation, and complications. RESULTS Total intubation duration was significantly shorter in group C (39.5 \u00B1 11.4 s) compared to group M (48.1 \u00B1 13.9 s). Group C required significantly less time for glottic visualization and endotracheal tube placement in the trachea. More patients in group C had CL grade I and higher POGO scores (P \u003C 0.001, for both measures). No difficulty in NTI (modified NIDS = 0) was more in group C than group M. Hemodynamic changes and incidence of complications were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION The C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope is an effective tool for NTI in a simulated difficult airway, which improves glottic visualization and shortens intubation time relative to those with McCoy laryngoscope.

Purpose The aim of the study was to determine the value of quantification of the well-aerated lung obtained at baseline chest CT for determining prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent chest CT suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia at the emergency department admission between February 17 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasal-pharyngeal swabs, negative chest CT, and incomplete clinical data were excluded. CT was analyzed for quantification of well aerated lung visually (%V-WAL) and by open-source software (%S-WAL and absolute volume, VOL-WAL). Clinical parameters included demographics, comorbidities, symptoms and symptom duration, oxygen saturation and laboratory values. Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (ICU admission/death vs. no ICU admission/ death). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine model performance. Results The study included 236 patients (females 59/123, 25%; median age, 68 years). A %V-WAL\u003C73% (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.7-10.8; P\u003C0.001), %S-WAL\u003C71% (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.9-7.5; P\u003C0.001), and VOL-WAL\u003C2.9 L (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.8; P\u003C0.01) were predictors of ICU admission/death. In comparison with clinical model containing only clinical parameters (AUC, 0.83), all three quantitative models showed higher diagnostic performance (AUC 0.86 for all models).

This meta-analysis aimed to explore the risk of severe Covid-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing smoking history. METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22nd March 2020 from 5 Database. The language of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe Covid-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. RESULTS Overall 11 case-series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases were included in the study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe Covid-19 was 4.38 (Fixed effect model, 95% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (Fixed effect model, 95% CI: 1.29-3.05). There was no publication bias as examined by the funnel plot and Egger\u0027s test (p=NS). The heterogeneity of included studies was moderate for both COPD and ongoing smoking history on the severity of Covid-19.

Although these changes are necessary, they will differentially affect patients in a way that highlights and exacerbates existing inequities in health care access and outcomes. Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality. Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care. Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes.

METHODS Computerized literature searches were performed from four search engines. The studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were screened using Covidence (Cochrane tool) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards (PRISMA-2009). A total 2645 studies were initially retrieved, of which a total of 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers, blinded to each other, evaluated level and strength of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence and QualSyst, respectively. RESULTS Dysphagia prevalence ranged from 16 to 78% among the eligible studies. Studies varied in operational definitions defining swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) and method used to assess swallowing function. Approximately 70% of eligible studies demonstrated strong methodological quality. The majority of studies (n = 11; 65%) reported pharyngeal swallowing impairments in patients with OSAS, including delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow and penetration/aspiration. CONCLUSION This systematic review describes swallowing function in patients with OSAS. However, due to the variability in defining OSAS and dysphagia, in the assessment method used to determine dysphagia, and heterogeneity of study designs, true prevalence is difficult to determine. Clinicians involved in the management of OSAS patients should employ validated assessment measures to determine if swallow dysfunction is present.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhutada, Ankita M; Broughton, William A; Focht Garand, Kendrea L","journal":"Sleep \u0026 breathing = Schlaf \u0026 Atmung","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02037-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OSAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eligible studies","majority of studies","swallowing function","prevalence of dysphagia","swallowing dysfunction","management of OSAS patients","RESULTS Dysphagia prevalence","pharyngeal swallowing impairments","strength of evidence","published evidence","Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence","Systematic Reviews","swallow dysfunction","assessment method","true prevalence","inclusion criteria","total","delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow","exclusion criteria","validated assessment measures","Meta-Analyses statement standards","Oxford Centre","Preferred Reporting Items","heterogeneity of study designs","penetration","operational definitions","alterations","PRISMA","Cochrane tool","QualSyst","strong methodological quality","METHODS Computerized literature searches","CONCLUSION","aspiration","Covidence","OBJECTIVES","purpose","search engines","Clinicians","variability","reviewers"],"language":"en"},

In many cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses result in the global inhibition of translation and the storage of stalled mRNAs, into RNA-protein aggregates called stress granules. This results in the translational silencing of the majority of mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the specific stress. For example, the expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling pathways, whilst at the same time, IBV replication also results in the induction of seemingly canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular translation and antiviral stress signaling.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brownsword, Matthew J; Doyle, Nicole; Brocard, Mich\u00E8le; Locker, Nicolas; Maier, Helena J","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral stress","cellular stress responses","specific stress","stress granule formation","stress granule regulation","multiple cellular stress granule","canonical stress granules","IBV infection","IBV replication","results","cellular translation machinery","viral infection","global inhibition of translation","Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","translational repression","majority of mRNAs","translational silencing","viral genes","storage of stalled mRNAs","expression of antiviral factors","processes","RNA-protein aggregates","induction","pathways","novel insights","important poultry disease","proportion of infected cells","independent of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","example","time","Viruses","cases"],"language":"en"},

Emerging evidence demonstrates that older individuals and people with underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The ACE-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) consisting of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant ACE-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalan, Rinkoo; Bornstein, Stefan R; El-Armouche, Ali; Rodionov, Roman N; Markov, Alexander; Wielockx, Ben; Beuschlein, Felix; Boehm, Bernhard O","journal":"Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1155-0501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upregulation of ACE","activated ACE-Ang","concomitant ACE","downregulation of ACE","strained ACE","Mas axis","AT1R axis","respiratory system","renin angiotensin system","receptor upregulation","upregulation of Mas activation","dual system renin-angiotensin","metabolic disorders","increased insulin resistance","pro-fibrotic effects","protective effects","antifibrotic effects","nephropathy","myocardial fibrosis","anti-inflammatory","prognosis","insulin secretory defects","terms of respiratory compromise","vascular dysfunction","vascular function","increased age","Emerging evidence","underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus","acute management of COVID","people","older individuals","antioxidative stress","hyperlipidemia","hypertension","pancreatitis","RAS","higher risk of morbidity","humans","enzyme","mortality","modulation","balance","SARS-CoV","axes","entry","virus","hand","use","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial \u0022cytokine storm\u0022, as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian \u0022resetting\u0022 of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, George; Reiter, Russel J","journal":"Reviews in medical virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Melatonin"],"organizations":["PDC","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitochondrial melatonin","mitochondrial melatonergic pathway","immune cells","suppression of pineal melatonin","Pineal melatonin suppression","viral infections","melatonergic pathway role","mitochondrial metabolism","viral replication","melatonergic pathways","immune regulators","immune responses","acetyl-CoA","PDC","cytokine-storm","viral inhibition of Bmal1","cytokine storm-driven changes","acetyl-coenzyme","acetyl group","mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate","immune cell phenotype","oxidative phosphorylation","switches cells","driven control","butyrate","covid","cellular changes","LPS","regulation","control of cellular function","shifting metabolism","circadian gene","tricarboxylic acid cycle","pyruvate dehydrogenase complex","short-chain fatty acid","host symptom severity","necessary cosubstrate","impacts","arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase","levels","gut permeability","influenza","neutrophil attraction","dysbiosis","quiescent phenotypes","viruses","treatment implications","important aspect","ATP production","circulating lipopolysaccharide","resetting","serotonin","growing appreciation","alterations"],"language":"en"},

IBV is responsible for causing severe losses to the commercial poultry sector globally. The objectives of this study were to identify the viruses that were causing outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in chickens in Trinidad and Tobago (T\u0026T) and to characterize the strains. Swab samples were collected from birds showing severe respiratory signs in five farms on the island of Trinidad. Samples were tested for the presence of IBV, as well as Avian Influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All samples from the five farms tested negative for AIV, NDV and aMPV; however samples from clinically affected birds in all five of the farms tested positive for IBV. Genetic data revealed the presence of TCoV in chickens on two of the farms. Interestingly, these two farms had never reared turkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IBV S1 sequences formed two distinct clusters. Two sequences grouped with vaccine strains within the GI-1 lineage, whereas three sequences grouped together, but separately from other defined lineages, forming a likely new lineage of IBV. Pairwise comparison revealed that the three unique variant strains within the new lineage of IBV were significantly different in their S1 nucleotide coding regions from viruses in the closest lineage (16% difference) and locally used vaccine strains (\u003E20% difference). Results also suggested that one of the samples was a recombinant virus, generated from a recombination event between a Trinidad virus of the GI-1 lineage and a Trinidad virus of the newly defined lineage. Many amino acid differences were also observed between the S1 coding regions of the circulating field and vaccine strains, indicating that the IBV vaccines may not be protective. Vaccine-challenge studies are however needed to prove this.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown Jordan, Arianne; Fusaro, Alice; Blake, Lemar; Milani, Adelaide; Zamperin, Gianpiero; Brown, Gabriel; Carrington, Christine V F; Monne, Isabella; Oura, Christopher A L","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438523/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Trinidad"],"keyphrases":["Trinidad virus","presence of IBV","farms","IBV S1 sequences","IBV vaccines","likely new lineage of IBV","recombinant virus","closest lineage","Avian Influenza virus","used vaccine strains","Newcastle disease virus","Swab samples","infectious bronchitis virus","island of Trinidad","S1 coding regions","unique variant strains","severe losses","aMPV","S1 nucleotide coding regions","NDV","outbreaks of severe respiratory disease","severe respiratory signs","Avian metapneumovirus","chickens","AIV","Avian coronaviruses","important viruses","presence of TCoV","birds","Vaccine-challenge studies","defined lineages","commercial poultry sector","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","circulating field","qRT-PCR","Tobago","turkey coronavirus","recombination event","distinct clusters","Phylogenetic analysis","Genetic data","amino acid differences","comparison","study","reared turkeys","objectives","Results"],"language":"en"},

Chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions refer to chronic diseases that can be managed in primary care settings, including angina, asthma, and diabetes, with hospitalizations for these conditions considered potentially avoidable with adequate primary care interventions. Socioeconomic inequities in the risk of hospitalization have been observed in several health systems globally. While there are multiple studies examining the association between socioeconomic status and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, these studies have not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this study is to systematically identify and describe socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions amongst adult populations in economically developed countries reported in high-quality observational studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature was searched in six health and social science databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ASSIA, and IBSS using search terms for hospitalization, socioeconomic status, and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Study titles and abstracts were first screened followed by full-text review according to the following eligibility criteria: 1) Study outcome is hospitalization for selected chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions; 2) Primary exposure is individual- or area-level socioeconomic status; 3) Study population has a mean age \u00B1 1 SD \u003C 75 years of age; 4) Study setting is economically developed countries; and 5) Study type is observational. Relevant data was then extracted, and studies were critically appraised using appropriate tools from The Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were narratively synthesized according to socioeconomic constructs and type of adjustment (minimally versus fully adjusted). RESULTS Of the 15,857 unique peer-reviewed studies identified, 31 studies met the eligibility criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Socioeconomic constructs and hospitalization outcomes varied across studies. However, despite this heterogeneity, a robust and consistent association between lower levels of socioeconomic status and higher risk of hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions was observed. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify and analyze literature on the relationship between SES and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, considering both aggregate and condition-specific outcomes that are common to several international health systems. The evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for hospitalization across global settings. Effective health and social interventions are needed to reduce these inequities and ensure fair and adequate care across socioeconomic groups.

Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4\u002B and some CD8\u002B T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as IL-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study retrospectively reviews 1132 patients who underwent 4 different laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomies: hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALDN), pure laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (PLDN), laparoendoscopic single-site plus 1-port donor nephrectomy (LESSOP-DN), and mini laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (MLDN). RESULTS The mean estimated blood loss (EBL) for the HALDN group was meaningfully higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (57.5\u00B152.2 mL versus 21.0\u00B130.0 mL versus 18.2\u00B128.7 mL) (P\u003C0.001). The EBL for PLDN (53.3\u00B135.3 mL) was also significantly higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (P\u003C0.001). Length of stay (LOS) for HALDN was longer than that for LESSOP-DN (4.2\u00B11.2 day versus 4.0\u00B11.4 days, P=0.002). There was 1 intraoperative open conversion in the HALDN group and 2 HALDN surgeries that required postoperative exploratory laparotomy. LESSOP-DN had 3 (0.8%) postoperative incisional hernias. For recipients, the results revealed no significant differences between all 4 groups in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the 1-year graft failure rate. CONCLUSIONS The LESSOP-DN group was associated with a shorter incision length than those of HALDN and PLDN and shorter LOS than that of HALDN.

A literature review revealed few reports providing front-line clinical and research teams guidance related to multilevel, rapidly evolving COVID-19 directives.Method: The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) method was used to develop a clinical case series and conduct participant observation during an ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of peer-integrated, patient-centered interventions after traumatic injury. Participants were patients enrolled in the intervention arm of the ongoing trial, as well as front-line clinicians, patient peer interventionists, and clinical research team members implementing the trial. All participants were exposed to the Washington State COVID-19 outbreak.Results: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies were feasibly integrated into ongoing care coordination and behavioral interventions for at-risk patients. Beyond the compilation of case studies, as an iterative method, RAPICE data collection naturalistically evolved to include observations of intervention team activity occurring within the larger pandemic epicenter context. A daily clinical research team huddle that flexibly accommodated virtual participation was also feasibly implemented.Conclusions: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies can be feasibly integrated into ongoing clinical interventions during the pandemic. Routine, proactive clinical and research team communication that transparently addresses ethical tensions and health-sustaining activities may promote well-being for providers grappling with rapidly evolving pandemic directives. Proactive assessments of individual provider vulnerabilities for severe COVID-19 related respiratory illness may also be a crucial element of the health care system pandemic responses.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moloney, Kathleen; Scheuer, Hannah; Engstrom, Allison; Schreiber, Merritt; Whiteside, Lauren; Nehra, Deepika; Walen, Mary Lou; Rivara, Frederick; Zatzick, Douglas","journal":"Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2020.1750214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ongoing clinical interventions","clinical research team members","Clinical Ethnography","secondary COVID","evolving COVID","severe COVID","ongoing trial","daily clinical research team huddle","Washington State COVID","clinical case series","research team communication","pandemic crisis","evolving pandemic directives","ongoing care coordination","larger pandemic epicenter context","ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of peer","health care system pandemic responses","research teams guidance","iterative method","observations of intervention team activity","patient-centered interventions","outbreak","behavioral interventions","prevention strategies","Participants","patient peer interventionists","Washington State emerging","front-line clinicians","intervention arm","at-risk patients","health-sustaining activities","RAPICE data collection","early US epicenter","related respiratory illness","compilation of case studies","Proactive assessments of individual provider vulnerabilities","conduct participant observation","ethical tensions","Rapid Assessment Procedure","crucial element","providers","King County","reports","Results","well-being","traumatic injury","virtual participation","Conclusions","Routine","literature review","Coronavirus disease","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The mean ages of the patients were 69.8 \u00B1 53.4 months (3 months to 17 years). In six patients, contralateral processus vaginalis was found to be patent during operation. Incarcerated inguinal hernia was present in two patients. Mean operative time was 17.9 \u00B1 3.8 min (9-30 min) in unilateral hernias and 28.9 \u00B1 6.5 min (24-45 min) in bilateral hernias. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were encountered. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 8.8 \u00B1 5.0 h (4-36 h). Postoperative follow-up was 16.5 \u00B1 5.1 months (6-24 months). No recurrent inguinal hernias were detected during follow-up. CONCLUSION Single conventional port intracorporeal IHR obviates additional stab wounds. Additionally, present technique eliminates the risk of skin puckering, subcutaneous granuloma, infection, nerve, and muscle damage development induced by the subcutaneously placed knot in laparoscopy-assisted IHR. Single conventional port intracorporeal IHR in children is a feasible and safe operative technique with low complication rates.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karaku\u015F, O Z; Ulusoy, O; Ate\u015F, O; Hakg\u00FCder, G; Olguner, M; Akg\u00FCr, F M","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02165-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSION Single conventional port intracorporeal IHR","laparoscopic IHR","months","records patients","recurrent inguinal hernias","bilateral hernias","inguinal hernia repair","Incarcerated inguinal hernia","operative time","present technique","unilateral hernias","single working instrument","safe operative technique","laparoscopy","postoperative complications","Postoperative follow-up","mean ages","mean hospital","additional stab wounds","PURPOSE Laparoscopic","children","infection","patient\u0027s demographic characteristics","risk of skin puckering","nerve","subcutaneous granuloma","main outcome measurements","presence of incarceration","low complication rates","muscle damage development","placed knot","contralateral processus vaginalis","patent","METHODS","boys","girls","experience","years","total","operation"],"language":"en"},

Invasive hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) has been accepted as treatment alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for selected patients, while transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) of the upper airway is being investigated as non-invasive alternative. METHODS A meta-analysis (CRD42017074674) on the effects of both HNS and TES on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in OSA was conducted including published evidence up to May 2018. Random-effects models were used. Heterogeneity and between-study variance were assessed by I2 and \u03C42, respectively. RESULTS Of 41 identified clinical trials, 20 interventional trials (n = 895) could be pooled in a meta-analysis (15 HNS [n = 808], 5 TES [n = 87]). Middle-aged (mean \u00B1 SD 56.9 \u00B1 5.5 years) and overweight (body mass index 29.1 \u00B1 1.5 kg/m2) patients with severe OSA (AHI 37.5 \u00B1 7.0/h) were followed-up for 6.9 \u00B1 4.0 months (HNS) and 0.2 \u00B1 0.4 months (TES), respectively. The AHI improved by - 24.9 h-1 [95%CI - 28.5, - 21.2] in HNS (\u03C72 79%, I2 82%) and by - 16.5 h-1 [95%CI - 25.1, - 7.8] in TES (\u03C72 7%, I2 43%; both p \u003C 0.001). The ESS was reduced by - 5.0 (95%CI - 5.9, - 4.1) (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION Both invasive and transcutaneous electrical stimulation reduce OSA severity by a clinically relevant margin. HNS results in a clinically relevant improvement of symptoms. While HNS represents an invasive treatment for selected patients with moderate to severe OSA, TES should be further investigated as potential non-invasive approach for OSA.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratneswaran, Deeban; Guni, Ahmad; Pengo, Martino F; Al-Sherif, Miral; He, Baiting; Cheng, Michael Cf; Steier, Joerg; Schwarz, Esther I","journal":"Sleep \u0026 breathing = Schlaf \u0026 Atmung","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02069-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HNS","TES","OSA","AHI","ESS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TES","HNS results","severe OSA","OSA severity","invasive treatment","transcutaneous electrical stimulation","AHI","I2","CI","PURPOSE Electrical stimulation","selected patients","treatment alternative","Invasive hypoglossal nerve stimulation","emerging treatment","non-invasive alternative","meta-analysis","\u03C72","months","upper airway dilator muscles","apnea-hypopnea index","continuous positive airway pressure","clinical trials","interventional trials","relevant margin","obstructive sleep apnea","body mass index","relevant improvement of symptoms","potential non-invasive approach","Random-effects models","CPAP","years","Epworth Sleepiness Scale","CRD42017074674","m2","CONCLUSION","study variance","mean","SD","METHODS","Heterogeneity","\u03C42","published evidence"],"language":"en"},

News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haines, Seline; Caccamo, Amy; Chan, Fonda; Galaso, German; Catinchi, Alexis; Gupta, Puneet K","journal":"The Neurodiagnostic journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21646821.2020.1756132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEG","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modified COVID","cause of COVID","standard EEG protocol","hospital protocol","EEG workflow","technologist exposure time","time analysis","coronavirus disease","minutes","modifications","case","standard procedures","appropriate PPE","staff exposure","high quality patient care","hospital resources","procedure workflow","infectious disease","chance of virus transmission","recommendations available","droplet","neurodiagnostic-related organizations","significant decrease","worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment","hospitals","airborne precautions","resource utilization","contact","concerns","clear guidelines","increased stress","anxiety","experience","SARS-COV","frontline healthcare workers","News reports","information","adaptations","protocols","spike","spell","critical moment","seizure","technologists safe","article","patients"],"language":"en"},

To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. METHODS A well-mixed \u0022susceptible exposed infectious recovered\u0022 (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. RESULTS Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. CONCLUSION The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.

This ability is achieved through materials of diverse characteristics. Electrets are dielectrics that trap charges or dipoles.

Stretchable dielectrics are short-lived electrets. The two properties-longevity and stretchability-conflict; existing electrets struggle to attain both. This work describes an approach to developing stretchable electrets. Nanoparticles of hard electret are immobilized in a matrix of dielectric elastomer. The composite divides the labor of two functions: the particles trap charges with longevity, and the matrix enables stretchability. The design considerably broadens the choice of materials to enable stretchable electrets.

Ultrasound examination of the kidneys and perinephric space can provide important information on several conditions including chronic renal disease, hydronephrosis and perinephric pseudocyst formation. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Despite ultrasonography being a commonly used modality, many practitioners are not comfortable performing an ultrasound examination or interpreting the resulting images. Even for the experienced ultrasonographer, differentiating between incidental findings, such as a medullary rim sign, and pathological changes can be challenging. AIM This review, part of an occasional series on feline abdominal ultrasonography, discusses ultrasonographic examination of the normal and diseased kidney and perinephric space. Aimed at general practitioners who wish to improve their knowledge of and confidence in feline abdominal ultrasound, this review is accompanied by high-resolution images and videos available online as supplementary material. A subsequent article will address ultrasonography of the collecting system including the renal pelvis and urinary bladder.

In this pilot study, we explore SEOP in gas mixtures with up to 45% 4He content under a wide range of experimental conditions. When an aluminum jacket cooling/heating design was employed (GEN-3 hyperpolarizer), 129Xe polarization (%PXe) of 55.9 \u00B1 0.9% was observed with mono-exponential build-up rate \u03B3SEOP of 0.049 \u00B1 0.001 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 49.3 \u00B1 3.3% at \u03B3SEOP of 0.035 \u00B1 0.004 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe/100 Torr He, 900 Torr N2).

Additionally, %PXe of 72.6 \u00B1 1.4% was observed at a build-up rate \u03B3SEOP of 0.041 \u00B1 0.003 min-1 for a super-high-density 4He-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1200 Torr 4He/130 Torr N2), compared to %PXe = 56.6 \u00B1 1.3% at a build-up rate of \u03B3SEOP of 0.034 \u00B1 0.002 min-1 for an N2-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1330 Torr N2) using forced air cooling/heating. The observed SEOP hyperpolarization performance under these conditions corresponds to %PXe improvement by a factor of 1.14 \u00B1 0.04 at 1000 Torr Xe density and by up to a factor of 1.28 \u00B1 0.04 at 1330 Torr Xe density at improved SEOP build-up rates by factors of 1.61 \u00B1 0.18 and 1.21 \u00B1 0.11 respectively.

In addition to improved thermal stability for SEOP, the use of 4He-rich gas mixtures also reduces the overall density of produced inhalable HP contrast agents; this property may be desirable for HP 129Xe inhalation by human subjects in clinical settings-especially in populations with heavily impaired lung function.

The two principal devices used for OLV are a double-lumen tube (DLT) and a bronchial blocker (BB). We hypothesized that the use of a BB with the disconnection technique would improve the quality of lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods Seventy-five patients undergoing scheduled VATS were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: a left-sided DLT group (Group D) and a BB with the disconnection technique group (Group B). OLV was initiated when the surgeon performed the skin incision. In Group D, the left channel of the DLT was opened to the air. In Group B, the lung was deflated via the disconnection technique, thus opening the breathing circuit to the air fifteen seconds after opening the pleura. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during induction; the quality of lung collapse 1 and 10 minutes after pleural opening; the time required for complete lung collapse; the correct placement of the device; and the number of patients suffering from a sore throat after surgery were recorded. Results Compared with the use of the DLT, the use of the BB with the disconnection technique was associated with a similar quality of lung collapse, a comparable required time for total lung collapse (P\u003E0.05, respectively), a lower incidence of sore throat both when leaving the PACU and 24 hours after surgery (34.2% vs. 13.5%, 15.8% vs. 5.4%, P\u003C0.05, respectively) and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations after intubation both one and ten minutes after pleural opening. Conclusions The use of a BB with the disconnection technique in VATS offers an effective method for improving the quality of lung collapse and reducing postoperative sore throat.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Qian; He, Zhiyong; Xue, Ping; Xu, Qianyun; Zhu, Minmin; Chen, Wankun; Miao, Changhong","journal":"Journal of thoracic disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.12.75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274155/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OLV","DLT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disconnection technique group","complete lung collapse","total lung collapse","BB","similar quality of lung collapse","lung ventilation","Group D","Group B","use","left-sided DLT group","OLV","pleural opening","postoperative sore throat","scheduled VATS","lower incidence of sore throat","minutes","thoracoscopic surgery","air","comparable required time","left channel","number of patients","MAP","video","heart rate","induction","correct placement","effective method","double-lumen tube","breathing circuit","mean arterial pressure","intubation","seconds","PACU","essential component of thoracic anesthesia","bronchial blocker","fewer hemodynamic fluctuations","surgeon","Methods","groups","Background","principal devices","skin incision","hours","study","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

With the Internet harvesting large amounts of data from the general population in real-time, public databases such as Google Trends (GT) and the Baidu Index (BI) can be an expedient tool to assist public health efforts. OBJECTIVE To apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine utility in the providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS An epidemiologic time-series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020 to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was utilized for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain and the American states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia/ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r\u003E.60, P\u003C.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated RW confirmed cases by 12 days (r=.85\u00B1.10 and r=.76\u00B1.09 respectively, P\u003C.001). Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag of greater than one week compared to new daily cases; whereas, searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the utility of digital epidemiology in providing helpful surveillance data of disease outbreaks like COVID-19. While certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization\u0027s globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Communicable diseases intelligence","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Australia","United States of America","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["Australia","Confirmed cases","case detection","detection of mild cases","public health measures","public health action","likely reflective of high case ascertainment","crude case fatality rate","effective public health response","international travel","World Health Organization\u0027s","country","notifications","reduction of disease transmission","recent overseas travel","lower CFR","disease dynamics","United Kingdom","rates of increase","social distancing measures","Interpretation of international epidemiology","United States of America","domestic movement","prompt identification of contacts","people","differences","comparable high-income countries","small portion unable","caution","spread of COVID","deaths","ratio","jurisdiction","regions","trend"],"language":"en"},

The regions considered were all 50 U.S. states and 110 countries (those which had enough data available by April 10th. We looked for associations between the above variables and an estimate of the growth rate of cases, the exponential coefficient, computed using data for 10 days starting when state/country reached 100 confirmed cases. The results for U.S. states indicate that one cannot expect that higher temperatures and higher levels of absolute humidity would translate into slower pace of Covid-19 infection rate, at least in the ranges of those variables during the months of February and March of 2020 (-2.4 to 24C and 2.3 to 15g/m3). In fact, the opposite is true: the higher the temperature and the absolute humidity, the faster the Covid-19 has expanded in the U.S. states, in the early stages of the outbreak. Secondly, using the highest county population density for each state, there is strong positive association between population density and (early) faster spread of Covid-19. Finally, there is strong negative association between the date when a state reached 100 accumulated cases and the speed of Covid-10 outbreak (the later, the lower the estimate of growth rate). When these variables are considered together, only population density and the timeline variable show statistical significance. We also develop the basic models for the collection of countries, without the demographic variable. Despite the evidence, in that case, that warmer and more humid countries have shown lower rates of Covid-19 expansion, the weather variables lose statistical significance when the timeline variable is added.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedrosa, Renato H.L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58f667195a4d1c1c1aee1dec3f0cd9bb59e6e92b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074450v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["timeline of Covid","speed of Covid","weather variables","faster spread of Covid","types of variables","lower rates of Covid","slower pace of Covid","timeline variable","states","growth rate of cases","higher levels of absolute humidity","highest county population density","infection rate","early pace","estimate of growth rate","higher temperatures","statistical significance","humid countries","accumulated cases","collection of countries","outbreak of disease","confirmed cases","different regions","demographic variable","early stages","strong positive association","strong negative association","different dates","data available","expansion","exponential coefficient","country","ranges","basic models","opposite","days","fact","effects","months","m3","evidence","results","associations"],"language":"en"},

Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xianding; Gu, Wei; Federman, Scot; Du Plessis, Louis; Pybus, Oliver; Faria, Nuno; Wang, Candace; Yu, Guixia; Pan, Chao-Yang; Guevara, Hugo; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia; Zorn, Kelsey; Gopez, Allan; Servellita, Venice; Hsu, Elaine; Miller, Steve; Bedford, Trevor; Greninger, Alexander; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Famulare, Michael; Chu, Helen Y; Shendure, Jay; Starita, Lea; Anderson, Catie; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Zeller, Mark; Spencer, Emily; Andersen, Kristian; MacCannell, Duncan; Tong, Suxiang; Armstrong, Gregory; Paden, Clinton; Li, Yan; Zhang, Ying; Morrow, Scott; Willis, Matthew; Matyas, Bela; Mase, Sundari; Kasirye, Olivia; Park, Maggie; Chan, Curtis; Yu, Alexander; Chai, Shua; Villarino, Elsa; Bonin, Brandon; Wadford, Debra; Chiu, Charles Y","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b465a9c7686a63c3040711b860e294f191860b49.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044925","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northern California","Washington State","United States","California"],"keyphrases":["different SARS-CoV","slow SARS-CoV","presumptive transmission of SARS","cryptic transmission of SARS","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","cases of community transmission","widespread community transmission","multiple transmission chains","genomic epidemiology of SARS","Northern California","Virus genomes","cruise ship passengers","lineages","reported cases","COVID","multiple independent introductions","distinct introductions","interstate travel","Grand Princess cruise ship","travel restrictions","Washington State","unclear infection sources","consecutive excursions","social distancing","travelers","contact tracing","WA1 genome","samples","date","Rapid testing","single predominant lineage","genetic diversity","pandemic","patients","established epidemic","United States","Phylogenetic analyses","evidence","findings","regions","USA"],"language":"en"}]}

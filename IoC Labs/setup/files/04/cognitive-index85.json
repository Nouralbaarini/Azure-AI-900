In 2009 serologic responses to either pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccine (n = 36) or pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection (n = 2) were studied in 38 HSCT recipients. METHODS: Responses were measured with a standard hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Fourteen patients had active chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) at the time of vaccination/infection and seven patients had cGvHD in remission; 11 patients had no immunosuppressive therapy, and 27 patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. Nineteen patients (53%) responded to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination. Two patients had pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection without prior vaccination, and one patient had severe pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome despite prior single vaccination. RESULTS: Non-responders to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination more often had cGvHD (65 vs. 53%) and received second- or third-line therapy (53 vs. 11%), while responders mostly had first-line therapy for cGvHD. While vaccine responders had no or single agent immunosuppressive therapy, non-responders frequently received moderate or intense immunosuppressive therapy. All vaccine recipients previously treated with rituximab were non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the overall response to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination in HSCT recipients was modest. Patients receiving combined immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory cGvHD barely responded to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination.","publish_time":"2011-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roll, D.; Ammer, J.; Holler, B.; Salzberger, B.; Schweiger, B.; Jilg, W.; Andreesen, R.; Edinger, M.; Wolff, D.; Holler, E.","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c57b656db36885bcdf1334e85aab7ad1d6f96cc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","primary pandemic H1N1","severe pandemic H1N1","prior vaccination","time of vaccination","line therapy","combined immunosuppressive therapy","intense immunosuppressive therapy","prior single vaccination","infection","Non-responders","HSCT recipients","vaccine responders","vaccine recipients","single agent immunosuppressive therapy","steroid-refractory cGvHD","immunologic responses","serologic responses","recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Limited data","host disease","active chronic graft","overall response","summary","rituximab","RESULTS","remission","standard hemagglutination-inhibition assay","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Six of the 29 donors were HLA-phenotypically identical and two were mismatched relatives, 13 were mismatched siblings and eight were mismatched parents. Six patients received no antigen (relatives), 15 patients one antigen, five patients two antigen and three patients three antigen disparate grafts. Twenty-three patients were in class 2 or class 3, whereas six patients were in class 1. Thirteen patients were given BUCY, nine patients BUCY plus ALG, six patients BUCY plus TBI or TLI and one patient BUCY with prior cytoreductive-immunosuppressive treatment as conditioning. As GVHD prophylaxis four patients received MTX, 22 CsA \u002B MTX \u002B methylprednisolone (MP) and three patients CsA \u002B MP. Thirteen of 29 patients (44.8%) had sustained engraftment. The probability of graft failure or rejection was 55%. There were no significant differences between antigen disparities and graft failure. The incidence of grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD was 47.3% and chronic GVHD was 37.5%. The incidence of acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving one or two antigen disparate in the GVHD direction grafts (vs no antigen) (P EQ 0.04; odds ratio 10.8; 95% CI 1.5\u2013115). The probability of overall and event-free survival was 65% and 21%, respectively, with median follow-up of 7.5 years (range 0.6\u201317 years) for surviving patients. The degree of HLA disparity between patient and donor did not have a significant effect on survival. The incidence of nonhematologic toxicity was low. Transplant-related mortality was 34%. GVHD (acute or chronic) was a major contributing cause of death (50%) followed by infections (30%). We conclude that at present, due to high graft failure and GVHD rates, BMT from alternative donors should be restricted to patients who have poor life expectancies because they cannot receive adequate conventional treatment or because of alloimmunization to minor blood antigens.

Despite the burden of disease associated with exacerbations, little is known about the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of airway diseases.

Cytokine storm syndromes can be genetic or a secondary complication of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, infections, and haematological malignancies. These syndromes represent a key area of interface between rheumatology and general medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience using intensive immunosuppressive regimens and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). Interleukin (IL)-1 is pivotal in hyperinflammation. Anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is licenced at a dose of 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still\u0027s disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. In cytokine storm syndromes, the subcutaneous route is often problematic, as absorption can be unreliable in patients with critical illness, and multiple injections are needed to achieve the high doses required. As a result, intravenous anakinra is used in clinical practice for sHLH/MAS, despite this being an off-licence indication and route of administration. Among 46 patients admitted to our three international, tertiary centres for sHLH/MAS and treated with anakinra over 12 months, the intravenous route of delivery was used in 18 (39%) patients. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in the management of cytokine storm syndromes and review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra. There is accumulating evidence to support the rationale for, and safety of, intravenous anakinra as a first-line treatment in patients with sHLH/MAS. Intravenous anakinra has important clinical relevance when high doses of drug are required or if patients have subcutaneous oedema, severe thrombocytopenia, or neurological involvement.

A number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified in subjects with KS, but none of them can currently be considered a real marker of susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Various data suggest that KS is intimately related to infectious diseases and that its clinical expression is influenced by predisposing genetic backgrounds, but our knowledge of the infectious agent(s) involved and the genetic characteristics of susceptible children remains only partial.

A live attenuated vaccine (LAV) and glycoprotein E (gE) subunit vaccine were developed to prevent VZV\u2010induced diseases. We recently reported that single\u2010strand RNA (ssRNA) based on the intergenic region of the internal ribosome entry site of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is an effective adjuvant for protein\u2010based and virus\u2010like particle\u2010based vaccines. Here, Chinese hamster ovary expression system and an LAV from Oka/SK strains. METHODS: We appraised the adjuvant effect of the same CrPV ssRNA encoding the gE gene formulated in the two vaccines using VZV\u2010primed C57BL/6 mice and guinea pigs. Humoral immunity and cell\u2010mediated immunity were assessed by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISPOT in gE subunit vaccine and by ELISA and fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen in LAV. RESULTS: The gE subunit vaccine\u2010induced gE\u2010specific antibodies and CD4(\u002B) T\u2010cell responses (indicated by interferon\u2010\u03B3 [IFN\u2010\u03B3] and interleukin\u20102 secretion) in the ssRNA\u2010based adjuvant containing the VZV gE gene. Therefore, an ssRNA adjuvant combined with gE antigen can trigger the innate immune response and induce an adaptive immune response to ultimately activate humoral and cell\u2010mediated responses. VZV LAV could also induce VZV\u2010specific antibodies and IFN\u2010\u03B3 stimulated by LAV, whereas the effect of ssRNA as a vaccine adjuvant could not be confirmed. However, the ssRNA adjuvant increased VZV\u2010specific neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results highlight that the gE subunit vaccine and LAV developed in this study can be functional VZV vaccines, and ssRNAs appear to function better as adjuvants in a subunit vaccine than in an LAV.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Su Jeen; Park, Hyo\u2010Jung; Ko, Hae Li; Lee, Jung Eun; Lee, Hyun Joo; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae\u2010Hwan","journal":"Immun Inflamm Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8283f147574b1e6ea7ce216707b66a6b3e23fc94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212201.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167678/; https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAV","VZV","VZV LAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gE subunit vaccine","VZV LAV","vaccine adjuvant","VZV gE gene","ssRNA adjuvant increased VZV","gE antigen","induced gE","based adjuvant","CrPV ssRNA","functional VZV vaccines","effect of ssRNA","adjuvant effect","effective adjuvant","based vaccines","live attenuated vaccine","specific antibodies","cell responses","specific neutralizing antibody response","ELISA","adaptive immune response","zoster virus","innate immune response","Humoral immunity","RESULTS","mediated immunity","IFN","mediated responses","fluorescent antibody","membrane antigen","induced diseases","internal ribosome entry site of cricket paralysis virus","glycoprotein E","enzyme","CD4","ELISPOT","intergenic region","primed C57BL","Chinese hamster ovary expression system","linked immunosorbent assay","Oka","mice","interferon","study","chickenpox","ssRNAs","Varicella","secretion","guinea pigs","human alphaherpesvirus","shingles","INTRODUCTION","SK strains","strand RNA","interleukin","adjuvants","particle","postherpetic neuralgia","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Common themes to emerge from studies of picornavirus replication are the need for cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P).

For the enteroviruses, replication organelles form at Golgi membranes in a process that utilizes PI4KIII\u03B2. Other picornaviruses, for example the cardioviruses, are believed to initiate replication at the endoplasmic reticulum and subvert PI4KIII\u03B1 to generate PI4P. Here we investigated the role of PI4KIII in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication.

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95).

After immunization and fusions, 14 hybridomas bearing DNA-hydrolysis activity against pUC19 plasmid DNA were obtained. Genes coding for VH and VL regions of the 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were cloned and sequenced. The sequences were compared with sequences of the Ig-Blast database to determine their germline and to identify potential mutations responsible for DNA binding and DNase activity. V genes of the H chains\u2019 genes expressed four genes of the VH1/J558 family, three of VH5/VH7183, and three of VH8/VH3609. The genetic repertoire of these mAbs was examined by determining the nucleotide sequences of their H chain V regions. This VH and VL domain was most similar to an anti-ssDNA (DNA-1) antibody as well as to catalytic autoimmune mAb (m3D8). Computer-generated models of the three-dimensional structures of VH and VL (VHL4) of the IgG4 combinations were used to define the positions occupied by the important sequence motifs at the binding sites. The modeling structure showed that VHL4 binds to oligo (dT3) primarily by sandwiching thymine bases between Tyr L32, Tyr L49 and Tyr H97 side-chains. Superposing VHL4 with anti-nucleic acid m3D8 catAbs revealed a common ssDNA recognition module consisting of His L93, His H35 residues which are critical for DNA-hydrolyzing antibodies. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of the protein DNA surrogate in the investigation of the origin of anti-DNA antibodies\u2019 hydrolyzing activities.","publish_time":"2010-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zein, Haggag S.; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.; Miyatake, Kazutaka","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a230b1296c1e059a0e9e2cc0844c5d606b404ba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112887.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247810000325; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2010.01.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247810000325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20097230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA binding","DNA transformation","DNA-hydrolyzing antibodies","DNA-hydrolysis activity","protein DNA surrogate","pUC19 plasmid DNA","V genes","origin of anti-DNA antibodies\u2019 hydrolyzing activities","anti-ssDNA","VL regions","Genes coding","H chains\u2019 genes","Tyr L32","Tyr L49","Tyr H97","Superposing VHL4","VL domain","nucleotide sequences","monoclonal antibodies","mAbs","H chain V regions","three-dimensional structures of VH","anti-nucleic acid m3D8 catAbs","potential usefulness","DNase activity","binding sites","potential mutations responsible","characteristic of autoimmune diseases","catalytic autoimmune mAb","common ssDNA recognition module","sandwiching thymine bases","investigation","important sequence motifs","L93","germline","dT3","change","hybridomas","J558 family","positions","oligo","H35 residues","VH1","antibody","Ig-Blast database","Computer-generated models","VH7183","VH5","IgG4 combinations","fusions","modeling structure","VH8","immunization","genetic repertoire","pathology","study","VH3609","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Here, we incorporate an epidemic model into a game theoretical framework to investigate the effects of travel strategies on infection control.

We compare the individually optimal (Nash equilibrium) strategy to the group optimal strategy that maximizes the overall population utility. Economic epidemiological models often find that individual and group optimal strategies are very different. By contrast, we find perfect agreement between individual and group optimal strategies across a wide parameter regime. For more limited regimes where disagreement does occur, the disagreement is (i) generally very extreme; (ii) highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits; and (iii) can manifest either in a higher travel volume for individual optimal than group optimal strategies, or vice versa. The simulations show qualitative agreement with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Beijing, China. We conclude that a conflict between individual and group optimal visitor travel strategies during outbreaks may not generally be a problem, although extreme differences could emerge suddenly under certain changes in economic and epidemiological conditions.","publish_time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shi; Bauch, Chris T.; He, Daihai","journal":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0610f94b9b4f04ebb0c6597c5f263df1e1d65384.json; document_parses/pdf_json/647a2f1bb70641f6b6e691a911cb20714845d578.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6170783.xml.json","url":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2018.0515; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2018.0515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["group optimal strategies","group optimal strategy","group optimal visitor travel strategies","effects of travel strategies","higher travel volume","disagreement","Economic epidemiological models","infection transmissibility","visitor costs","certain changes","small changes","perfect agreement","qualitative agreement","infection control","epidemiological conditions","extreme differences","Potential visitors","risk of infectious disease outbreaks","SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","game theoretical framework","wide parameter regime","Nash equilibrium","epidemic model","Beijing","important role","benefits","overall population utility","conflict","spread of infections","China","problem","destination","limited regimes","simulations","contrast"],"language":"en"},

One population of these virus-specific CTL recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein.

The CTLs were found to recognize a peptide contained within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids of the N protein. Analysis of infected cell lines expressing transfected major histocompatibility genes demonstrated that the anti-N protein CTLs were restricted exclusively to the L\u00B0 molecule.

Although it has been well-contained, sporadic cases continue to emerge. Objectives The authors trace the emergence of the SARS outbreak from southern China and its spread worldwide, discuss the viral etiology of the infection and its clinical features, and review the infection control guidelines issued during the outbreak by the health authorities in Hong Kong, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the American Dental Association. They also review the prospects for a new outbreak and preventive measures. Overview The disease, which is caused by a novel coronavirus termed the \u201CSARS coronavirus,\u201D or SARS-CoV, essentially spreads through droplet infection and affects people of any age. It has a mortality rate ranging from 10 to 15 percent. A major hallmark of this disease has been the rate at which it has affected health care workers through nosocomial transmission; in some countries, up to one-fourth to one-third of those infected were in this category. However, no dental health care worker has been affected by SARS in a nosocomial or dental setting. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Researchers believe that a combination of factors, including the universal infection control measures that the dental community has implemented and/or the low degree of viral shedding in the prodromal phase of SARS, may have obviated the spread of the disease in dental settings. The dental community should reflect on this outbreak to reinforce the currently applied infection control measures.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"SAMARANAYAKE, LAKSHMAN P.; PEIRIS, MALIK","journal":"The Journal of the American Dental Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b40211137abb9cc6003d105bc8c0aac09754058f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093872.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002817714625423; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817714625423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization","American Dental Association","Clinical Implications"],"locations":["Asia","North America","China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","SARS coronavirus","Disease Control","dental community","SARS-CoV","dental settings","infection control guidelines","universal infection control measures","applied infection control measures","dental health care worker","droplet infection","new outbreak","prodromal phase of SARS","American Dental Association","health authorities","health care workers","World Health Organization","spread","preventive measures","nosocomial transmission","viral etiology","clinical features","novel coronavirus","new century","mortality rate","Clinical Implications Researchers","low degree of viral shedding","Centers","Hong Kong","Prevention","ABSTRACT Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","combination of factors","emergence","southern China","epidemic","parts of North America","sporadic cases","Asia","Conclusions","people","panic","authors","prospects","Objectives","countries","major hallmark","age","category","percent"],"language":"en"},

However, a lack of available genomic information has become a limitation for research on this species. Thus, we carried out high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing of H. cordata to generate an enormous transcriptome sequence dataset for gene discovery and molecular marker development. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Illumina paired-end sequencing technology produced over 56 million sequencing reads from H. cordata mRNA. Subsequent de novo assembly yielded 63,954 unigenes, 39,982 (62.52%) and 26,122 (40.84%) of which had significant similarity to proteins in the NCBI nonredundant protein and Swiss-Prot databases (E-value \u003C10(\u22125)), respectively. Of these annotated unigenes, 30,131 and 15,363 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. In addition, 24,434 (38.21%) unigenes were mapped onto 128 pathways using the KEGG pathway database and 17,964 (44.93%) unigenes showed homology to Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae) genes in BLASTx analysis. Furthermore, 4,800 cDNA SSRs were identified as potential molecular markers. Fifty primer pairs were randomly selected to detect polymorphism among 30 samples of H. cordata; 43 (86%) produced fragments of expected size, suggesting that the unigenes were suitable for specific primer design and of high quality, and the SSR marker could be widely used in marker-assisted selection and molecular breeding of H. cordata in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first application of Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to investigate the whole transcriptome of H. cordata and to assemble RNA-seq reads without a reference genome.

The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of CXCL10 to the pathogenesis of experimental septic shock in mice. METHODS: Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and, in some cases, the broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin. Studies were performed in CXCL10 knockout mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Endpoints included leukocyte trafficking and activation, core body temperature, plasma cytokine concentrations, bacterial clearance and survival. RESULTS: CXCL10 was present at high concentrations in plasma and peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced septic shock. Survival was significantly improved in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to controls. CXCL10KO mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG showed attenuated hypothermia, lower concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) in plasma and lessened natural killer (NK) cell activation compared to control mice. Compared to control mice, bacterial burden in blood and lungs was lower in CXCL10-deficient mice but not in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 IgG plus fluids and Primaxin at 2 or 6 hours after CLP significantly improved survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG under the same conditions. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CLP-induced septic shock and could serve as a therapeutic target during the acute phase of septic shock.","publish_time":"2014-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herzig, Daniela S; Luan, Liming; Bohannon, Julia K; Toliver-Kinsky, Tracy E; Guo, Yin; Sherwood, Edward R","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba502a88e3f83aa9e3d5edd649970db6da85c5bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4075230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890566/; https://doi.org/10.1186/cc13902","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CXCL10 knockout mice","CXCL10-deficient mice","control mice","CXCL10KO mice","anti-CXCL10 IgG","Treatment of mice","chemokine CXCL10","contributions of CXCL10","anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G","non-specific IgG","pathogenesis of experimental septic shock","pathogenesis of CLP","acute phase of septic shock","improved survival","plasma cytokine concentrations","high concentrations","lower concentrations of interleukin","cell activation","bacterial burden","bacterial clearance","leukocyte trafficking","chemokine receptor CXCR3","important regulator of lymphocyte trafficking","broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin","core body temperature","NK","blood","attenuated hypothermia","peritoneal cavity","cases","lungs","lessened natural killer","inflammation","cecal ligation","fluids","MIP","therapeutic target","lactated Ringer\u2019s solution","infection","puncture","hours","role","macrophage inhibitory protein","Endpoints","RESULTS","Studies","controls","study","conditions","CONCLUSIONS","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","goal"],"language":"en"},

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly identified pulmonary pathogen that can cause fatal lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Little is known about progression rates from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD and risk factors associated with progression. Methods. A total of 118 HCT recipients receiving transplantation between 2004 and 2014 who had HMPV detected in nasopharyngeal, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were retrospectively analyzed. Results. More than 90% of the cases were identified between December and May. Among the 118 HCT patients, 88 and 30 had URI alone and LRD, respectively. Among 30 patients with LRD, 17 patients progressed from URI to LRD after a median of 7 days (range, 2\u201363 days). The probability of progression to LRD within 40 days after URI was 16%. In Cox regression analysis, steroid use \u22651 mg/kg prior to URI diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 5.10; P = .004), low lymphocyte count (HR, 3.43; P = .011), and early onset of HMPV infection after HCT (before day 30 after HCT; HR, 3.54; P = .013) were associated with higher progression to LRD. The median viral load in nasal wash samples was 1.1 \u00D7 10(6) copies/mL (range, 3.3 \u00D7 10(2)\u20131.7 \u00D7 10(9)) with no correlation between the viral load and progression. Conclusions. Progression from URI to LRD occurred in up to 60% of HCT recipients with risk factors such as systemic corticosteroid use or low lymphocyte counts. Further studies are needed to define the role of viral load in the pathogenesis of progressive disease.","publish_time":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Sachiko; Gooley, Ted A.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Stednick, Zachary; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0581de6374d58ca6d8d900063b9bbebf66ea54fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4928387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143659/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciw284; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/63/2/178/11279305/ciw284.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","URI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LRD","HCT recipients","HCT patients","URI diagnosis","progression rates","probability of progression","higher progression","HR","days","median viral load","role of viral load","risk factors","range","upper respiratory tract infection","early onset of HMPV infection","low lymphocyte counts","fatal lower respiratory tract disease","steroid use","lung biopsy samples","nasal wash samples","hematopoietic cell transplantation","pathogenesis of progressive disease","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","systemic corticosteroid","bronchoalveolar lavage","Cox regression analysis","pulmonary pathogen","hazard ratio","total","correlation","Human metapneumovirus","studies","copies","Background","Methods","Results","cases","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

A bioinformatics survey showed that AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) genes (localized in bone marrow, immune locations and microglia) relate to multiple host/pathogen interactomes (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Bornavirus, Borrelia burgdorferri, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, HSV-1, HERV-W, HIV-1, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, influenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Porphyrymonas gingivalis, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi). These interactomes also relate to the AD hippocampal transcriptome and to plaque or tangle proteins. Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa in immunocompetent cells. AD genes are enriched in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance, as supported by the old age of AD patients, implying resistance to earlier infections. APOE4 is concentrated in regions of high parasitic burden and protects against childhood tropical infections and hepatitis C. Immune/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, and TREM2 variants. AD genes are also expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is disrupted by AD risk factors (age, alcohol, aluminum, concussion, cerebral hypoperfusion, diabetes, homocysteine, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, pesticides, pollution, physical inactivity, sleep disruption, smoking) and by pathogens, directly or via olfactory routes to basal-forebrain BBB control centers. The BBB benefits from statins, NSAIDs, estrogen, melatonin, memantine, and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by upregulation of bacterial, viral, and fungal sensors/defenders in the AD brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid. AD serum amyloid-\u03B2 autoantibodies may attenuate its antimicrobial effects favoring microbial survival and cerebral invasion leading to activation of neurodestructive immune/inflammatory processes, which may also be augmented by age-related immunosenescence. AD may thus respond to antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2017-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carter, Chris J.","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer\u0027s disease reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bf7428a3d7bd1625f0e945398eb8ff045ea4b71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6159731.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3233/adr-170017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30480234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","BBB"],"locations":["Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["AD genes","AD brain","AD hippocampal transcriptome","AD risk factors","Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match","old age of AD patients","AD genome-wide association study","AD serum amyloid-\u03B2 autoantibodies","pathogen resistance","pathogen interactomes","immune locations","pathogen diversity","APOE4","BBB benefits","activation of neurodestructive immune","blood-brain barrier","cerebral invasion","cerebral hypoperfusion","hepatitis C","multiple host","multiple bacteria","implying resistance","GWAS datasets","earlier infections","inflammatory processes","Diverse pathogens","basal-forebrain BBB control centers","childhood tropical infections","inflammatory gain of function","Helicobacter pylori","Porphyrymonas gingivalis","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Cryptococcus neoformans","Candida albicans","pollution","Borrelia burgdorferri","Bornavirus","influenza","alcohol","physical inactivity","Toxoplasma gondii","antimicrobial effects","hypercholesterolemia","cytomegalovirus","hypertension","pesticides","obesity","fungi","homocysteine","diabetes","NSAIDs","aluminum","concussion","microglia","defenders","Ebola virus","sleep disruption","microbial survival","olfactory routes","fungal sensors","bone marrow","memantine","melatonin","HSV","estrogen","regions of high parasitic burden","Epstein-Barr","smoking","statins","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","plaque","selection","upregulation of bacterial","Trypanosoma cruzi"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the association between hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and cognitive function. METHODS: From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999\u20132002, we selected study participants (\u226560 years, n = 1,529) without hepatitis B, C, or D virus infection; without previous hepatitis A vaccination; and without abnormal liver function. HAV-seropositive participants represented people with previous HAV infection. Psychomotor speed and executive functioning domain of cognitive function were measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). RESULTS: HAV-seropositive participants had lower DSST scores than HAV-seronegative participants (weighted mean, 44.4 vs 53.9, p \u003C .001). We designated HAV-seronegative participants as the reference group. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the weighted \u03B2 coefficient of DSST score was \u22129.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] \u22129.57 to \u22129.54, p \u003C .001) for the HAV-seropositive participants.

By analogy with other viral proteins that induce cell fusion the MHV S protein would be expected to have a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that serves as a fusion peptide. Sequence analysis suggests that the S protein falls within the group of fusion proteins having internal rather than N-terminal fusion peptides. Based on the features of known viral fusion peptides, we identified two regions (PEP1 and PEP2) of MHV-A59 S2 as possible fusion peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis and anin vitrocell-to-cell fusion assay were used to evaluate the roles of PEP1 and PEP2, as well as a third previously identified putative fusion domain (PEP3) in membrane fusion. Substitution of bulky hydrophobic residues with charged residues within PEP1 affects the fusion activity of the S protein without affecting processing and surface expression. Similar substitutions within PEP2 result in a fusion-negative phenotype; however, these mutant S proteins also exhibit defects in protein processing and surface expression which likely explain the loss of the ability to induce fusion. Thus PEP1 remains a candidate fusion peptide, while PEP2 may play a significant role in the overall structure or oligomerization of the S protein. PEP3 is an unlikely putative fusion peptide since it is not conserved among coronaviruses and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in PEP3 have minimal effects on cell-to-cell fusion.","publish_time":"1998-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Zongli; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3ba212286636a1f253021ef6172cfdb9c483f91.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682298991218; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298991218","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion activity","membrane fusion","cell fusion assay","viral fusion peptides","group of fusion proteins","possible fusion peptides","candidate fusion peptide","putative fusion domain","fusion-negative phenotype","unlikely putative fusion peptide","N-terminal fusion peptides","MHV S protein","protein processing","protein of coronavirus","mutant S proteins","PEP3","viral proteins","PEP2 result","roles of PEP1","surface expression","viral entry","MHV-A59 S2","charged residues","nonconservative amino acid substitutions","Substitution of bulky hydrophobic residues","Similar substitutions","hydrophobic stretch of amino acids","defects","minimal effects","mouse hepatitis virus","overall structure","anin vitrocell","oligomerization","attachment","significant role","coronaviruses","loss","regions","Site","mutagenesis","Sequence analysis","spike","features","ability","analogy","infection"],"language":"en"},

In HIV/AIDS, the rapid emergence of drug\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 variants is a major obstacle to current treatments. HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors are essential components of present antiretroviral therapies. However, with these protease inhibitors, resistance occurs through viral mutations that alter inhibitor binding, resulting in a loss of efficacy. This loss of potency has raised serious questions with regard to effective long\u2010term antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. In this context, our research has focused on designing inhibitors that form extensive hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with the enzyme\u2019s backbone in the active site. In doing so, we limit the protease\u2019s ability to acquire drug resistance as the geometry of the catalytic site must be conserved to maintain functionality. In this Review, we examine the underlying principles of enzyme structure that support our backbone\u2010binding concept as an effective means to combat drug resistance and highlight their application in our recent work on antiviral HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Arun K.; Anderson, David D.; Weber, Irene T.; Mitsuya, Hiroaki","journal":"Angew Chem Int Ed Engl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8da0f5020e940f90411a25d457a3b6caee1d604.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290878/; https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201102762","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protease inhibitors","antiviral HIV","resistant HIV","evolution of drug resistance","rapid emergence of drug","AIDS","effective long\u2010term antiretroviral therapy","effective means","enzyme\u2019s backbone","inhibitor binding","binding concept","loss of potency","active site","catalytic site","loss of efficacy","essential components of present antiretroviral therapies","regard","serious questions","variants","bonding interactions","viral mutations","application","major obstacle","extensive hydrogen","recent work","underlying principles of enzyme structure","geometry","current treatments","protease\u2019s ability","fundamental problems","medicine","Review","research","context","functionality"],"language":"en"},

Co-sedimentation of the dengue E protein and HIV-1 core proteins by sucrose gradient analysis of the pseudotype reporter virus of dengue virus type 2, D2(HIVluc), and detection of HIV-1 core proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-E monoclonal antibody suggested that dengue viral proteins were incorporated into the pseudotype viral particles. The infectivity in target cells, as assessed by the luciferase activity, can be inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents, suggesting a pH-dependent mechanism of entry. Amino acid substitutions of the leucine at position 107, a critical residue at the fusion loop of E protein, with lysine resulted in severe impairment in infectivity, suggesting that entry of the pseudotype reporter virus is mediated through the fusogenic properties of E protein. With more and more dengue viral sequences available from different outbreaks worldwide, this sensitive and convenient tool has the potential to facilitate molecular characterization of the PrM/E proteins of dengue field isolates.","publish_time":"2007-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hsien-Ping; Hsieh, Szu-Chia; King, Chwan-Chuen; Wang, Wei-Kung","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56f53b4a45d630d74a8cefcea4abbf26b3761593.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126519.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207004266; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207004266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PrM/E"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue E protein","dengue viral proteins","E proteins of dengue field isolates","core proteins","pseudotype reporter virus of dengue virus type","serotypes of dengue viruses","fusion loop of E protein","fusogenic properties of E protein","dengue viral sequences available","pseudotype viral particles","anti-E monoclonal antibody","PrM","infectivity","retrovirus-based reporter viruses","detection of HIV","pH-dependent mechanism of entry","immunoprecipitation","sucrose gradient analysis","different outbreaks","precursor membrane","lysine","leucine","position","potential","critical residue","HIVluc","D2","molecular characterization","envelope","convenient tool","severe impairment","Co-sedimentation","Amino acid substitutions","important arboviral diseases","century","lysosomotropic agents","target cells","study","luciferase activity","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Methods: COVID-19 literature review and consensus establishment between different Spanish ophthalmology societies in order to provide guidelines and recommendations of maximum resources primarily conditioned by the state of alert, confinement and social distancing that occurs in Spain since March 16, 2020. Results: The recommendations will promote the adoption of action and protection measures for eye care in outpatient clinics, surgical areas and hospitalization, for unconfirmed (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Measures must be adapted to the circumstances and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in each of the centers and Autonomous Communities, which will be updated according to the pandemic phases and the measures adopted by the Spanish Government. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, attention to the potential health risks to the population caused by coronavirus should prevail over the possible progression of the common eye diseases.

It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA. Here, we identified ANXA2 as a RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds IBV (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot RNA. We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an anti-viral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs.","publish_time":"2011-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwak, Hoyun; Park, Min Woo; Jeong, Sunjoo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bb9d8f7eeb8272924275f349e5c63a5bb006445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3168876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21918681/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Annexin"],"organizations":["RNA","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA pseudoknot","RNA binding protein","ANXA2 protein","RNA metabolism","frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA","binding of ANXA2","frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA","Overexpression of ANXA2","anti-viral cellular protein","cellular RBPs","cellular mRNAs","frameshifting region of IBV","diverse cellular functions","exocytosis","ultraviolet crosslinking","DNA synthesis","dual luciferase assay","Infectious Bronchitis Virus","roles","knockdown","cell proliferation","bait","Annexin A2","cells","results"],"language":"en"},

The diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated. In order to determine and compare which of the viral proteins may be useful as diagnostic antigens, whole virus (WV) particles and a panel of structural and nonstructural PEDV proteins [spike subunit 1 (S1), the C-terminal part of ORF3 (ORF3C), envelope (E), nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), Nsp2, Ac (acidic domain of Nsp3), and ADRP (ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase domain of Nsp3), expressed individually in bacterial and/or mammalian cells] were tested for reactivity with sera from PEDV-infected pigs by ELISA and/or western blot analysis. According to western blots, serum antibody interactions with the S1 protein were relatively more sensitive and specific than ORF3C, E and Ac. Furthermore, a total of 851 serum samples from diarrheal pigs of different ages were analyzed by ELISA, with most showing immune-reactivity towards the WV, S1, ORF3C, and E proteins. The earliest IgG antibody response was observed in the one-week-old piglets, with similar antibody ontogeny and patterns of seroconversion for S1, ORF3C, E, and WV antigens. In addition, the pattern of neutralizing antibody was more similar to that of IgA in weaning piglets after PEDV infection. Collectively, these data provide more reliable information on the host immune response to different viral proteins, which will be useful for development of novel serological assays and for design of vaccines that better stimulate protective immunity.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Xi-Mei; Yang, Yong-Le; He, Yong-Qiang; Peng, Lei; Zhao, Pengwei; Xu, Shu-Ya; Cao, Hongwei; Fang, Pengfei; Qiu, Wenying; Qin, Pan; Wang, Bin; Huang, Yao-Wei","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b15d045694070f5ef9844bffcf76b80698863665.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117304.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304365; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500721/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108387","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E proteins","nonstructural PEDV proteins","nonstructural proteins","ORF3C","S1 protein","different viral proteins","PEDV infection","diagnostic antigens","WV antigens","similar antibody ontogeny","PEDV-infected pigs","serum antibody interactions","sensitive diagnostic assays","diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pattern of neutralizing antibody","ELISA","immune-reactivity","earliest IgG antibody response","weaning piglets","host immune response","monophosphatase domain of Nsp3","acidic domain of Nsp3","week-old piglets","acute nature of porcine epidemic diarrhea","serum samples","diarrheal pigs of different ages","development of rapid","development of novel serological assays","western blots","western blot analysis","patterns of seroconversion","panel of structural","accessory","spike subunit","design of vaccines","Nsp2","reliable information","IgA","envelope","ADP-ribose","ADRP","urgent need","Nsp1","particles","total","sera","C-terminal","mammalian cells","addition","protective immunity","data","Abstract","order"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the discovery of a novel shrew hepadnavirus. The newly discovered virus, denoted shrew hepatitis B virus (SHBV), is divergent to be considered a new species of Orthohepadnavirus.

Due to this property, siRNAs are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of inherited and acquired diseases, as well as research tools for the elucidation of gene function in both health and disease. Because of their lethality and prevalence, lung diseases have attracted particular attention as targets of siRNA-mediated cures. In addition, lung is accessible to therapeutic agents via multiple routes, e.g., through the nose and the mouth, thus obviating the need for targeting and making it an appealing target for RNAi-based therapeutic strategies. The clinical success of siRNA-mediated interventions critically depends upon the safety and efficacy of the delivery methods and agents. Delivery of siRNAs relevant to lung diseases has been attempted through multiple routes and using various carriers in animal models. This review focuses on the recent progress in non-viral delivery of siRNAs for the treatment of lung diseases, particularly infectious diseases.

Experimental depletion of USP18 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing results in a significant restriction of HIV-1 replication in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophage model. In the absence of USP18, macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with T1 IFNs with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses. Interestingly, HIV-1 requires some signaling through the T1 IFN receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits T1 IFN activity reduces HIV-1 replication rate in monocyte-derived macrophages. USP18 induction by HIV-1 tunes the IFN response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the HIV-1 LTR promoter while minimizing the T1 IFN-induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread.

In this retrospective observational single-center study we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12(th) to April 10(th), 2020 as confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Among the 36 patients, 11 (30.5%) died and 7 could be discharged within the observation period. Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality. Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 Liters/minute and radiological worsening. Significantly 11 out of those 18 patients (61.1%) died. None of the classical cardiovascular risk factors in the general population were associated with higher mortality. However, a longer time on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 1.008(95% confidence interval 1.001-1.015) per year), increased LDH levels (1.006(1.001-1.011), and lower lymphocyte count (0.996 (0.992-1.000) one week after clinical onset were all significantly associated with higher mortality risk. Thus, the mortality among hospitalized hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is high. Lymphopenia and increased LDH levels were associated with poor prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goicoechea., Marian; S\u00E1nchez C\u00E1mara, Luis Alberto; Mac\u00EDas, Nicol\u00E1s; Mu\u00F1oz de Morales, Alejandra; Gonz\u00E1lez Rojas, \u00C1ngela; Bascu\u00F1ana, Arturo; Arroyo, David; Vega, Almudena; Abad, Soraya; Verde, Eduardo; Garc\u00EDa Prieto, Ana Mar\u00EDa; Verdalles, Ursula; Barbieri, Diego; Felipe Delgado, Andr\u00E9s; Carbayo, Javier; Mijaylova, Antonia; P\u00E9rez de Jos\u00E9, Ana; Melero, Rosa; Tejedor, Alberto; Rodriguez Benitez, Patrocinio; de Jos\u00E9, Ana P\u00E9rez; Rodriguez Ferrero, Maria Luisa; Anaya, Fernando; Rengel, Manuel; Barraca, Daniel; Lu\u00F1o, Jos\u00E9; Aragoncillo, In\u00E9s","journal":"Kidney Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b64cf2cdb8e3552b24b71341507a45af7442629.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437770/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820305093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820305093?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MHD patients","hospitalized hemodialysis patients","clinical course","higher mortality risk","clinical status","clinical onset","COVID","predictive of mortality","general population","maintenance hemodialysis","increased LDH levels","radiological worsening","classical cardiovascular risk factors","non-survivors","longer time","week of admission","radiological evolution","oxygen therapy requirements greater","real time polymerase chain reaction","Liters","severe hypoxia","laboratory data","hazard ratio","optimal management of novel coronavirus disease","different therapies","minute","retrospective observational single-center study","Baseline features","pneumonia","year","outcomes","poor prognosis","confidence interval","evidence","Lymphopenia","lower lymphocyte count","SARS-CoV","Wuhan","China","observation period"],"language":"en"},

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R(0), the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a \u201Clockdown\u201D was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \u201Clockdown\u201D to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R(0) from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37\u20130.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22\u20130.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarvis, Christopher I.; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Gimma, Amy; Prem, Kiesha; Klepac, Petra; Rubin, G.

For fiscal year 2013, the Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services readmission penalties have been applied to acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. However, the overall impact of pneumonia pathogen characterization on hospital readmission is undefined. METHODS This was a retrospective 6-year cohort study (August 2007 to September 2013). RESULTS We evaluated 9,624 patients with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. Among these patients, 4,432 (46.1%) were classified as having culture-negative pneumonia, 1,940 (20.2%) as having pneumonia caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 2,991 (31.1%) as having pneumonia caused by potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and 261 (2.7%) as having viral pneumonia. The 90-day hospital readmission rate for survivors (n = 7,637, 79.4%) was greatest for patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%) followed by viral pneumonia (8.3%), pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (6.6%), and culture-negative pneumonia (5.8%) (P \u003C .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria to be independently associated with 90-day readmission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.56-1.97; P \u003C .001). Other independent predictors of 90-day readmission were Charlson comorbidity score \u003E 4, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease. Culture-negative pneumonia was independently associated with lower risk for 90-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS Readmission after hospitalization for pneumonia is relatively common and is related to pneumonia pathogen characterization. Pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with an increased risk for 90-day readmission, whereas culture-negative pneumonia is associated with lower risk for 90-day readmission.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andruska, Adam; Micek, Scott T.; Shindo, Yuichiro; Hampton, Nicholas; Colona, Brian; McCormick, Sandra; Kollef, Marin H.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8b0f3c4c588bd808b3f3246d28dd53637a91499.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127757.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215500251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25429607/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215500251; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-2129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pneumonia","culture-negative pneumonia","day readmission","discharge diagnosis of pneumonia","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","CONCLUSIONS Readmission","overall impact of pneumonia pathogen characterization","day hospital readmission rate","antibiotic-susceptible bacteria","Medicaid Services readmission penalties","patients","lower risk","increased risk","BACKGROUND Hospital readmissions","fiscal year","year cohort study","cirrhosis","Centers","Medicare","acute myocardial infarction","heart failure","Charlson comorbidity score","survivors","Multiple logistic regression analysis","hospitalization","chronic kidney disease","independent predictors","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Worldwide this disease has infected over 2.5 million individuals with a mortality rate ranging from 5 to 10%. There are several efforts going on in the drug discovery to control the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The main protease (M(Pro)) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of M(Pro), we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae M(Pro) in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of M(Pro) structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). In agreement with this, we performed screening of \u223C7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro) as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules like \u03B4-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). Intrestingly, these molecules also showed strong binding with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection like viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with SARS-CoV in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309- and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinto, Dora; Park, Young-Jun; Beltramello, Martina; Walls, Alexandra C; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Bianchi, Siro; Jaconi, Stefano; Culap, Katja; Zatta, Fabrizia; De Marco, Anna; Peter, Alessia; Guarino, Barbara; Spreafico, Roberto; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Case, James Brett; Chen, Rita E; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Snell, Gyorgy; Telenti, Amalio; Virgin, Herbert W; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Diamond, Michael S; Fink, Katja; Veesler, David; Corti, Davide","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enhanced SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV pseudoviruses","authentic SARS-CoV","S309","Antibody cocktails","S receptor-binding domain","pandemic","multiple monoclonal antibodies","host cells","binding assays","main target of neutralizing antibodies","emergence of neutralization","receptor attachment","high risk of exposure","post-exposure therapy","memory B cells","individuals","prophylaxis","current COVID","glycoprotein","entry","spike","therapeutic discovery efforts","emerged coronavirus responsible","Vaccine","cryo-electron microscopy","sarbecovirus subgenus","escape mutants","epitope","way","severe disease","zoonotic virus","glycan","results","infections","deaths"],"language":"en"},

The dynamic pre-mRNPs incorporate the growing transcript, proteins, and the processing machineries, as well as the specific protein marks left after processing that are essential for export and the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNPs. After release from the gene, the mRNPs move by diffusion within the interchromatin compartment, making up pools of mRNPs.

Using both metagenomics based on virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (VLP metagenomics), and meta-transcriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterised and compared the faecal viromes of captive and wild Tasmanian devils. A total of 54 devil faecal samples collected from captive (n = 2) and wild (n = 4) populations were processed for virome characterisation using both approaches. We detected many novel, highly divergent viruses, including vertebrate viruses, bacteriophage and other dietary associated plant and insect viruses. In total, 18 new vertebrate viruses, including novel sapelovirus, astroviruses, bocaviruses, papillomaviruses and gammaherpesvirus were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens including rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). Captive devils showed significantly lower levels of viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two methodological approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with meta-transcriptomics mainly identifying RNA viruses, and VLP metagenomics largely identifying DNA viruses. This study has greatly expanded our knowledge of eukaryotic viruses in the Tasmanian devil and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. In addition, our results showed that a combination of VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach to virome characterisation than either method alone.","publish_time":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Rowena; Shi, Mang; Grueber, Catherine E; Holmes, Edward C; Hogg, Carolyn; Belov, Katherine; Barrs, Vanessa R","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e569f5e2881c0b9d3ea317e0fd831081d9f577b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/564f8823050b52b5f5c36638ac1ae07557963f36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/443457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFTD","VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","types of viruses","insect viruses","divergent viruses","DNA viruses","new vertebrate viruses","Captive devils","knowledge of eukaryotic viruses","wild devils","wild Tasmanian devils","meta-transcriptomics","combination of VLP metagenomics","endangered species","captive management","devil faecal samples","faecal viromes of captive","devil facial tumour disease","virome characterisation","DFTD","total","endangered carnivorous marsupial","rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus","novel sapelovirus","methodological approaches","known mammalian pathogens","bulk RNA sequencing","potential conservation relevance","astroviruses","dietary associated plant","sequence-independent amplification","lower levels of viral diversity","bacteriophage","substantial differences","bocaviruses","enrichment","number","comprehensive approach","particle","important baseline information","papillomaviruses","RHDV2","populations","gammaherpesvirus","results","research","Comparison","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

There are as yet no licensed MERS vaccines or therapeutics. This study (WRAIR-2274) assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine in healthy adults. METHODS: This study was a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of GLS-5300 done at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research Clinical Trials Center (Silver Spring, MD, USA). We enrolled healthy adults aged 18\u201350 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS. Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0\u00B767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02670187) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and July 22, 2016, we enrolled 75 individuals and allocated 25 each to 0\u00B767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300. No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0\u00B767 mg, 11 [44%] with 2 mg, and seven [28%] with 6 mg), and malaise or fatigue (five [20%] with 0\u00B767 mg, seven [28%] with 2 mg, and two [8%] with 6 mg). The most common local solicited symptoms were administration site pain (23 [92%] with all three doses) and tenderness (21 [84%] with all three doses). Most solicited symptoms were reported as mild (19 [76%] with 0\u00B767 mg, 20 [80%] with 2 mg, and 17 [68%] with 6 mg) and were self-limiting. Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 56 participants (75%) of 75 and were deemed treatment-related for 26 (35%). The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment. There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0\u00B767 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group). Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants and 61 (94%) of 65 participants after two and three vaccinations, respectively. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants. T-cell responses were detected in 47 (71%) of 66 participants after two vaccinations and in 44 (76%) of 58 participants after three vaccinations. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks. At week 60, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were detected in 51 (77%) of 66 participants and 42 (64%) of 66, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus vaccine was well tolerated with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events. Immune responses were dose-independent, detected in more than 85% of participants after two vaccinations, and durable through 1 year of follow-up. The data support further development of the GLS-5300 vaccine, including additional studies to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus.

Enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay. Surveillance and source apportionment of enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management. However, individual monitoring of the \u003E100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is unfeasible. Instead, viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination, viral decay and transport in water. An ideal indicator for tracking wastewater contamination should be (i) easy to detect and quantify, (ii) source-specific, (iii) resistant to wastewater treatment processes, and (iv) persistent in the aquatic environment, with similar behaviour to viral pathogens. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer-reviewed publications, to critically evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution, including common enteric viruses (mastadenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and Aichi viruses), the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and gut-associated bacteriophages (Type II/III FRNA phages and phages infecting human Bacteroides species, including crAssphage). Our analysis suggests that overall, human mastadenoviruses have the greatest potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection, culturability, and high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment. Aichi virus, crAssphage and PMMoV are also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment, and may be used as molecular markers for human-derived contamination. We conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long-term monitoring of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and wastewater-based epidemiology, improve current risk management strategies and protect global human health.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farkas, Kata; Walker, David I.; Adriaenssens, Evelien M.; McDonald, James E.; Hillary, Luke S.; Malham, Shelagh K.; Jones, Davey L.","journal":"Water Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26e08ced295167f38992debd4d79a410624d6485.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211501.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420304632?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417460/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135420304632","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human wastewater","domestic wastewater","tracking wastewater contamination","viral indicators of wastewater pollution","viral decay","enteric viral strains","quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination","long-term monitoring of viral contamination","viral pathogens","wastewater-based epidemiology","common enteric viruses","Waterborne enteric viruses","human-derived contamination","wastewater treatment processes","Aichi viruses","human mastadenoviruses","source apportionment of enteric viruses","global human health","aquatic environments","human Bacteroides species","PMMoV","monitoring programmes","aquatic contaminants","individual monitoring","crAssphage","polluted environment","accurate risk management","global public health","current risk management strategies","rapid transport","FRNA phages","minimal decay","marine environments","easy detection","source-specific","pepper mild mottle virus","holistic assessment of microbiological water quality","environmental waters","major threat","freshwater","emerging cause of disease outbreaks","polyomaviruses","greatest potential","Type","high prevalence","culturability","similar behaviour","gut-associated bacteriophages","peer-reviewed publications","resistant","molecular markers","ideal indicator","Surveillance","effectiveness","comprehensive review","analysis"],"language":"en"},

In conjunction with our infection disease experts, we developed our guidelines based upon potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure and conservation of PPE. Results A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created.

Traditional heterogeneous mean-field models on metapopulation networks ignore the heterogeneity of individuals who are in different disease states in subpopulations with the same degree, resulting in inaccuracy in predicting the spread of disease. In this paper, we take heterogeneity of susceptible and infectious individuals in subpopulations with the same degree into account, and propose a deterministic unclosed general model according to Markov process on metapopulation networks to curve the global transmission of diseases precisely. Then we make the general model closed by putting forward two common assumptions: a two-dimensional constant distribution and a two-dimensional log-normal distribution, where the former is equivalent to the heterogeneous mean-field model, and the latter is a system of weighted ordinary differential equations. Further we make a stability analysis for two closed models and illustrate the results by numerical simulations. Next, we conduct a series of numerical simulations and stochastic simulations. Results indicate that our general model extends and optimizes the mean-field model.

While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers. Owing to the highly linear light output of the luciferase reporter, some antibodies can be detected without serum dilution in a dynamic range of detection often spanning seven orders of magnitude. When LIPS is applied iteratively with multiple target antigens, a high-definition antibody profile is obtained. Here, we discuss the application of these different antibody-profiling technologies and their associated limitations with particular emphasis on protein microarrays. We also describe LIPS in detail and discuss several clinically relevant uses of the technology. Together, these new technologies offer new tools for understanding humoral responses to known and emerging infectious agents.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burbelo, Peter D; Ching, Kathryn H; Bush, Emily R; Han, Brian L; Iadarola, Michael J","journal":"Expert Review of Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9816684f175677470e6a73be3f370a90dde1be82.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8f0818f3cefecc27fb87796d4f79318dd22ee8ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3417761.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20518713/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3417761?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.50","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody responses","new antibody-profiling technologies","new technologies","different antibody-profiling technologies","new insights","solution-phase antibody-profiling technology","new tools","patient antibody titers","LIPS","high-definition antibody profile","new antigenic targets","recombinant antigens","different infectious agents","Analyses of humoral responses","emerging infectious agents","impure antigens","narrow dynamic range of detection","protein microarrays","infectious disease diagnostics","multiple target antigens","high backgrounds","luciferase reporter","suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes","recombinant antigen fusion proteins","solid-phase antigen arrays","luciferase immunoprecipitation systems","linear light output","associated limitations","pathogenic mechanisms","particular emphasis","drawbacks","vaccine research","serum dilution","development","overview of immunoreactivity","antibodies","large-scale studies","thousands","entire proteome of certain pathogens","type of information","hundreds","application","monitoring of vaccines","orders of magnitude","relevant uses","time","ELISAs"],"language":"en"},

Discussions were held under Chatham House rules. High-throughput screening of new vaccine antigens and candidates was seen as a driving force for vaccine discovery. Multi-stakeholder, small-scale manufacturing facilities capable of rapid production of clinical grade vaccines are currently too few and need to be expanded. In both the human and veterinary areas, there is a need for tiered regulatory standards, differentially tailored for experimental and commercial vaccines, to allow accelerated vaccine efficacy testing. Improved cross-fertilization of knowledge between industry and academia, and between human and veterinary vaccine developers, could lead to more rapid application of promising approaches and technologies to new product development.

Even though great progresses have been achieved in terms of target range and sensing principle, issues such as low final signal-to-background ratio and hard-to-realize one-tube smart analysis still exist and challenge real-world applications in gene detection. Here we propose a practical solution via coupling isothermal amplification (i.e. LAMP) and three-way amplifiable catalytic hairpin assembly (i.e. CHA) to a PGM. It allows direct transduction from genomic information to commercial portable devices with all of ultra-high sensitivity, specificity and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Compared with previous report without signal amplification, the introduction of CHA has successfully improved the signal amplitude by at least 12.5 folds. More importantly, through importing an effective three-way junction based transduction, we also innovatively develop a one-tube logical or multiplex analysis strategy in PGM based detection. Totally four situations of two foodborne bacteria genes, in Cronobacter sakazakii (ompA) and Escherichia coli (malB), could be directly readout using the final PGM signals, with the lowest detection amount down to less than 100 molecular copies (6.6 \u00D7 10\u221218 M).

Methods A multicenter cross-sectional survey of 100 hospitals participating in the national surveillance programs for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in the ROK was conducted in September 2015. The survey consisted of 140 standardized Web-based questionnaires. Results The survey response rate was 41.0%. The responding hospitals are largely organized with multibed rooms, with an insufficient numbers of single rooms. Employment status of infection specialists and hand hygiene resources were better in larger hospitals. The responding hospitals had 1 full-time infection control nurse per 400.3 \u00B1 154.1 beds, with wide variations in training and experience.

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors(1\u20139), but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID \u2018events\u2019 (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease \u2018hotspots\u2019). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.","publish_time":"2008-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Kate E.; Patel, Nikkita G.; Levy, Marc A.; Storeygard, Adam; Balk, Deborah; Gittleman, John L.; Daszak, Peter","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e74c8e7beafacf2d76ab272a8bf602bbae79475b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eabdb38c878ee9e571b6894600a1e1dd2df464cb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3135e20ef016fa4b3690d585ccd2057ee8c15879.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5960580.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18288193/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5960580?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EID events","origins of EIDs","EID origins","new EIDs","important EID","spatial patterns of EIDs","global economies","global temporal","global resources","non-random global patterns","reporting effort","emerging disease","ecological factors","database","majority","time","counter disease emergence","Ebola virus","reporting bias","surveillance effort","Emerging infectious diseases","severe acute respiratory virus","substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic","vector","significant burden","large number of drug","lower latitudes","resistant microbes","linkages","example","countries","basis","public health","peak incidence","rickettsia","regions","bacteria","events\u2019","concomitant","HIV pandemic","zoonoses","comparative study","hotspots\u2019","results"],"language":"en"},

In this contribution we discuss infections by influenza A (H5N1), SARS and Hanta virus. The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (bird flu) has crossed the species barrier and causes severe illness in humans. So far, 328 humans in twelve countries have contracted the disease and 200 have died. The young are particularly affected. Oseltamivir is the antiviral drug of choice and should be given as early as possible. Patients require supportive care, often including invasive ventilation. If H5N1 develops the ability to transmit efficiently between humans, an influenza pandemic is likely. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first seen in China in 2002. The outbreak was finally contained in 2003, by which time 8098 probable SARS cases had been identified with at least 774 deaths. The virus was identified in 2003 as belonging to the coronaviridae family. SARS is transmitted between humans and clusters have been seen. The mainstay of treatment is supportive. Various antiviral agents and adjunctive therapies were tried but none were conclusively effective. Hanta virus is an emerging cause of viral lung disease. In 1993, a new species of Hanta virus was recognized, after an outbreak of a new rapidly progressive pulmonary syndrome in the US, 465 cases of \u2018Sin Nombre\u2019 virus have now been seen in the US with a mortality rate of 35%. Many of the confirmed cases had contact with rodents (the major host of hanta viruses).

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409\u20137496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128\u20131929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588\u201313,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th \u2013 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roosa, K.; Lee, Y.; Luo, R.; Kirpich, A.; Rothenberg, R.; Hyman, J.M.; Yan, P.; Chowell, G.","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e44870f75892595841566f6b64dadffdc731f615.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3965a2d31b31a317f72d0f08695060dbd6952f82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7033348.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32110742/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["epidemic growth","Hubei province","province of Hubei","reported cases","cumulative confirmed cases","early cases","additional cases","provinces","additional confirmed cases","Richards growth model","early growth trajectory","Chinese province","cumulative number","sub-epidemic wave model","day forecasts","recent forecasts","recent days","phenomenological models","generalized logistic growth model","average total cumulative case count","initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases","human transmission","National Health Commission of China","short-term forecasts","consecutive days","containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns","Chinese government","limited data","nCoV outbreak","average range","overall trajectory","quantified uncertainty","ongoing outbreak","screening","train stations","airports","modelers","epidemiological characteristics","isolation of suspected patients","challenge","rapid spread","disease","COVID","epicenter","novel coronavirus","wet market","previous outbreaks","saturation","Mean estimates","reporting dates","findings","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are often used to detect viruses in samples, it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of PCR positivity, which may reflect a past, imminent or active asymptomatic infection due to their high sensitivity. Although single respiratory viruses have been detected in samples from children with symptoms, other respiratory viruses can also be detected simultaneously. However, the clinical importance of these findings for the symptoms is not known. Objectives To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children without any symptoms such as acute respiratory illness and/or fever. Study design From week twenty-five 2013 to week twenty-six 2014, gargle samples were collected from children once a week and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect respiratory viruses. On each sampling day, we asked the parents about their children\u2019s health condition. Results Among the 286 samples collected, 200 were from asymptomatic children. In the asymptomatic condition, human parechovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E and HKU1 were observed in 45 episodes. In samples from symptomatic children, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC43 were detected in addition to those mentioned above. Conclusions Various viruses of different species were detected in the specimens from the children regardless of their health status. It might be speculated that host factors such as the function of the immune system influence the clinical outcome of the infection. However, this needs to be studied further.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morikawa, Saeko; Hiroi, Satoshi; Kase, Tetsuo","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/916f40590e69b6004914559b3e6a8b8a073734b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106489.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215000189; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215000189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25728080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of respiratory viruses","single respiratory viruses","asymptomatic children","parainfluenza viruses","gargle samples","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory illness","symptoms","week","asymptomatic condition","Abstract Background Respiratory tract viral infection","active asymptomatic infection","Conclusions Various viruses of different species","real-time PCR","clinical significance of PCR positivity","clinical outcome","clinical importance","children\u2019s health condition","coronavirus OC43","health status","adenovirus","rhinovirus","enterovirus","human parechovirus","parents","past","tests","function","HKU1","immune system","Polymerase chain reaction","high sensitivity","important diseases","specimens","fever","findings","Study design","host factors","sampling day","addition","Objectives","episodes","Results"],"language":"en"},

VSV RNA synthesis occurs entirely within the cytoplasm, where during transcription the viral polymerase produces 5 mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to cellular mRNAs with respect to their 5\u2032 cap-structure and 3\u2032-polyadenylate tail. Using the global approach of massively parallel sequencing of total cytoplasmic, monosome- and polysome-associated mRNA, we interrogate the impact of VSV infection of HeLa cells on translation. Analysis of sequence reads in the different fractions shows \u003E60% of total cytoplasmic and polysome-associated reads map to the 5 viral genes by 6 hours post-infection, a time point at which robust host cell translational shut-off is observed. Consistent with an overwhelming abundance of viral mRNA in the polysome fraction, the reads mapping to cellular genes were reduced. The cellular mRNAs that remain most polysome-associated following infection had longer half-lives, were typically larger, and were more AU rich, features that are shared with the viral mRNAs. Several of those mRNAs encode proteins known to positively affect viral replication, and using chemical inhibition and siRNA depletion we confirm that the host chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3A (eIF3A)\u2014encoded by 2 such mRNAs\u2014support viral replication.

International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date, no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers. METHODS: Since 2006, Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometer\u2013based non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature \u226538\u00B0C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection. RESULTS: In 2011, of the 3,719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries, 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged \u226560 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6\u201329.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5\u20134.1), skin rashes (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI, 3.4\u201335.1), or a tympanic temperature \u226539\u00B0C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7\u20134.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all p values \u003C 0.05).

Given the threat of future outbreaks of severe coronavirus disease, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it is important to understand the mechanisms responsible for pulmonary fibrosis, so as to support the development of therapeutic countermeasures and mitigate sequelae of infection. In this article, we summarize pulmonary fibrotic changes observed after a SARS-CoV infection, discuss the extent to which other respiratory viruses induce fibrosis, describe available animal models to study the development of SARS-CoV induced fibrosis and review evidence that pulmonary fibrosis is caused by a hyperactive host response to lung injury mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. We summarize work from our group and others indicating that inhibiting EGFR signaling may prevent an excessive fibrotic response to SARS-CoV and other respiratory viral infections and propose directions for future research.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Frieman, Matthew B","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5153b2d372dcbb97abc94b5bfccc309fa01c7b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5507769.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216307975; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216307975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28390872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","EGFR"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS coronavirus","development of SARS","residual pulmonary fibrosis","CoV induced fibrosis","respiratory viral infections","respiratory viruses","pulmonary fibrotic changes","Middle East respiratory syndrome","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","sequelae of infection","excessive fibrotic response","threat of future outbreaks of severe coronavirus disease","future research","inhibiting EGFR","older patients","Autopsies of patients","hyperactive host response","development of therapeutic countermeasures","lung injury","review evidence","epidermal growth factor receptor","increased severity","available animal models","MERS","directions","mechanisms responsible","group","article","consequence","survivors","extents","work"],"language":"en"},

Landscape epidemiology uses statistical associations between environmental variables and diseases to study and predict their spatial distributions. Phylogeography augments epidemiological knowledge by studying the evolution of viral genetics through space and time. Cluster detection and early warning systems assist surveillance and can permit timely interventions. Advanced statistical models can accommodate spatial dependence present in epidemiological datasets and can permit assessment of uncertainties in disease data and predictions.

The vertical variation in wind directions, or the twist effect, significantly influences the Pedestrian Level Wind (PLW) field in urban areas of Hong Kong, thus it is a topic demanding systematic investigations. In this study, a new set of inflow boundary conditions are proposed to model twisted wind flows in Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. The new inflow boundary condition derived based on the horizontal homogeneous assumption, specifies a vertical profile of lateral wind speeds at the inlet boundary to sustain the twist effect in the empty computational domain. The proposed boundary conditions are used to simulate the PLW fields near three isolated buildings with different Height-to-Width ratio using two CFD codes; OpenFOAM, and FLUENT. The results reveal that OpenFOAM is more reliable in simulating PLW fields in twisted wind flows using the new set of boundary conditions.

The research community responded with a continuous effort to find this crucial relationship. This effort was aided by advances in processing techniques, improved sensitivity and spatial resolution of thermal sensors. However, despite this progress fundamental issues with this imaging modality still remain. The main problem is that the link between disease and heat radiation is complex and in many cases even non-linear. Furthermore, the change in heat radiation as well as the change in radiation pattern, which indicate disease, is minute. On a technical level, this poses high requirements on image capturing and processing. On a more abstract level, these problems lead to inter-observer variability and on an even more abstract level they lead to a lack of trust in this imaging modality. In this review, we adopt the position that these problems can only be solved through a strict application of scientific principles and objective performance assessment. Computing machinery is inherently objective; this helps us to apply scientific principles in a transparent way and to assess the performance results. As a consequence, we aim to promote thermography based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Another benefit of CAD systems comes from the fact that the diagnostic accuracy is linked to the capability of the computing machinery and, in general, computers become ever more potent. We predict that a pervasive application of computers and networking technology in medicine will help us to overcome the shortcomings of any single imaging modality and this will pave the way for integrated health care systems which maximize the quality of patient care.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faust, Oliver; Rajendra Acharya, U.; Ng, E.Y.K.; Hong, Tan Jen; Yu, Wenwei","journal":"Infrared Physics \u0026 Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfc50a9bd1ee95a96fbed71872961cdb239658da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350449514001042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350449514001042; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infrared.2014.06.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infrared","Computer-Aided Diagnosis","CAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heat radiation","disease","abstract level","radiation pattern","single imaging modality","benefit of CAD systems","research community","problems","change","technical level","Computing machinery","strict application of scientific principles","integrated health care systems","pervasive application of computers","objective performance assessment","processing techniques","transparent way","continuous effort","formidable problem","crucial relationship","performance results","main problem","invention of thermography","quality of patient care","Computer-Aided Diagnosis","improved sensitivity","spatial resolution of thermal sensors","networking technology","advances","high requirements","Infrared","link","capability","fact","progress fundamental issues","lack of trust","inter-observer variability","diagnostic accuracy","medicine","image","cases","shortcomings","cameras","position","review","consequence","minute"],"language":"en"},

Although PEDV vaccines based on classical PEDV strains have been widely used in China in recent years, the morbidity and mortality in piglets remain high. Therefore, virulent genotype GII PEDV strains that are prevalent in the field should be isolated and used to develop next-generation vaccines. In the present study, a Chinese virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain, CH/HNPJ/2017, was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 90 passages. The S genes contained typical insertions and deletions that were also found in other recently isolated highly virulent PEDV strains from China and other countries and had two neighboring unique insertion mutations, which resulted in four amino acid changes in the S1 region of passages P10 and P60. Pig infection studies revealed that the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain was highly virulent in piglets, and the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) was 7.68 log10PDD50/3 mL. Furthermore, the cell-adapted CH/HNPJ/2017 strain elicited potent serum IgG and neutralizing antibody responses in immunized pigs when it was used as an inactivated vaccine candidate. In addition, the pigs that received the experimental inactivated vaccines were partially protected (3/5) against subsequent viral challenge. In brief, these data indicate that the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain is a promising candidate for developing a safe and effective PEDV vaccine in the future.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xinsheng; Zhang, Qiaoling; Zhang, Liping; Zhou, Peng; Yang, Jun; Fang, Yuzhen; Dong, Zhaoliang; Zhao, Donghong; Li, Weiyan; Feng, Jiaxin; Cui, Baofeng; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05e18c649273a9124cbb290861443e9a6946a553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111334.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342075/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218305434; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.10.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218305434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virulent PEDV strains","PEDV vaccines","classical PEDV strains","HNPJ","virulent genotype GII PEDV strains","Chinese virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain","effective PEDV vaccine","virulent PED virus","Chinese pig population","China","cell-adapted CH","piglets","inactivated vaccine candidate","experimental inactivated vaccines","generation vaccines","median pig diarrhea dose","Pig infection studies","immunized pigs","promising candidate","severe porcine epidemic diarrhea","S1 region of passages P10","neutralizing antibody responses","potent serum IgG","outbreaks","morbidity","countries","mortality","amino acid changes","considerable economic losses","present study","S genes","typical insertions","deletions","neighboring unique insertion mutations","P60","recent years","field","future","data","subsequent viral challenge","log10PDD50","Abstract","Vero cells","brief","addition"],"language":"en"},

Although these properties are well established, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. In this study, GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture, toward a long term goal of discovering natural compounds that may complement existing vaccines. METHODS: Epithelial cells were treated with GA or GRA various times pre- or post-infection and virus yields were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. Levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunoblot to determine if there was an effect of GRA treatment on the accumulation of viral protein. RESULTS: GRA treatment reduced rotavirus yields by 99% when added to infected cultures post-- virus adsorption, whereas virus yields in GA treated cultures were similar to mock treated controls. Time of addition experiments indicated that GRA-mediated replication inhibition likely occurs at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry. The amounts of VP2, VP6 and NSP2 were substantially reduced when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours post-entry. CONCLUSIONS: GRA, but not GA, has significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication in vitro, and studies to determine whether GRA attenuates rotavirus replication in vivo are underway.","publish_time":"2012-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hardy, Michele E; Hendricks, Jay M; Paulson, Jeana M; Faunce, Nicholas R","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fce2cc8270c75b0db8e7679d63b40abc5470f6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3478227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22616823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-96","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GA","effect of GRA treatment","rotavirus replication","GRA-mediated replication inhibition","virus yields","GRA various times pre-","virus entry","infected cultures post-- virus adsorption","post-infection","VP6","NSP2","hours post-entry","mock treated controls","Levels of viral proteins VP2","amounts of VP2","Epithelial cells","immunomodulatory properties","significant antiviral activity","accumulation of viral protein","natural compounds","primary metabolite","cell culture","long term goal","\u03B2-glycyrrhetinic acid","active components","medicinal licorice root","Glycyrrhizin","steps subsequent","Time of addition experiments","ability","studies","immunofluorescent focus assay","existing vaccines","RESULTS","mechanisms of action","METHODS","BACKGROUND","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The S450\u2013650\u2010specific IgG Abs of BALB/c mice subcutaneously immunized with rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT were in substantially higher titer (approximately fivefold more). Furthermore, the fusion protein, but not rS450\u2013650 alone, was able to elicit S450\u2013650\u2010specific IgG responses in T cell deficient nude mice. Given that rCRT/39\u2013272 can drive the maturation of bone\u2010marrow\u2010derived dendritic cells, directly activate macrophages and B cells, and also elicit helper T cell responses in vivo, we propose that fragment 39\u2013272 of CRT is an effective molecular adjuvant capable of enhancing target Ag\u2010specific humoral responses in both a T cell\u2010dependent and independent manner. Fusion protein rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT is a potential candidate vaccine against SARS\u2010CoV infection.","publish_time":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Xiang; Hong, Chao; Li, Yue; Bao, Wanrong; Gao, Xiao\u2010Ming","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f335dc43c1482aaa7f589e53345f2288019c963.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2012.00467.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22530918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fusion protein rS450","recombinant S450","Fragment","specific IgG responses","helper T cell responses","specific humoral responses","recombinant fusion product","T cell deficient nude mice","specific IgG Abs of BALB","c mice","CoV infection","Vaccination of mice","convalescent sera of SARS patients","target Ag","epitopes capable","target antigen","B cells","higher titer","derived dendritic cells","effective molecular adjuvant capable","associated coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","potential candidate vaccine","marrow","macrophages","maturation of bone","independent manner","residues","spike","murine calreticulin","improved hydrophilicity","present study","prokaryotic expression system","immunogenicity","rCRT"],"language":"en"},

It is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the pig intestine. Colistin, a cationic antibiotic, is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of intestinal infections caused by E. coli, and particularly of PWD. However, despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of PWD, several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant E. coli in swine. Furthermore, this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans, being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Moreover, the recent discovery of the mcr-1 gene encoding for colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of MDR-GNB in humans. Consequently, it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only. Thus, to overcome the economic losses, which would result from the restriction of use of colistin, especially for prophylactic purposes in PWD control, we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of PWD in swine is crucial. Such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance. The present review begins with an overview of risk factors of PWD and an update of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes. Subsequently, alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed. Finally, a practical approach for the control of PWD in its various phases is proposed.","publish_time":"2017-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rhouma, Mohamed; Fairbrother, John Morris; Beaudry, Francis; Letellier, Ann","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa6b3fafeedf308826d58db91499b7c09f172310.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5437690.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-017-0299-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["PWD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PWD control","control of PWD","treatment of PWD","use of colistin","colistin resistance","update of colistin use","treatment of MDR","treatment of infections","high rates of colistin resistant","possible loss of colistin effectiveness","overview of risk factors of PWD","resort treatment","restriction of use","swine industry","oral treatment of intestinal infections","economic losses","GNB","humans","disease","cationic antibiotic","place of practical alternative strategies","multidrug-resistant","proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","bacterial resistance","high importance","animal production","practical approach","animal gut health","great concern","conjugative stable plasmid","Enterobacteriaceae","putting","terms of quantities","pigs","gene","studies","Gram-negative bacteria","prophylactic purposes","pig intestine","mcr","microbiological outcomes","alternatives","serious threats","development","Post-weaning diarrhea","various phases","recent discovery","present review","understanding"],"language":"en"},

We have constructed a recombinant IBV, BeauR-4/91(S), with the genetic backbone of Beau-R but expressing the spike protein of the pathogenic IBV strain 4/91(UK), which belongs to a different serogroup as Beaudette or M41. Similar to our previous findings with BeauR-M41(S), clinical signs observations showed that the S gene of the pathogenic 4/91 virus did not confer pathogenicity to the rIBV BeauR-4/91(S). Furthermore, protection studies showed there was homologous protection; BeauR-4/91(S) conferred protection against challenge with wild type 4/91 virus as shown by the absence of clinical signs, IBV RNA assessed by qRT-PCR and the fact that no virus was isolated from tracheas removed from birds primarily infected with BeauR-4/91(S) and challenged with IBV 4/91(UK). A degree of heterologous protection against M41 challenge was observed, albeit at a lower level.

Remarkably, while the group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses all have M proteins with N-linked sugars, the M proteins of the group 2 coronaviruses [e.g., mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)] are O-glycosylated. The conservation of the N- and O-glycosylation motifs suggests that each of these types of carbohydrate modifications is beneficial to their respective virus. Since glycosylation of the M protein is not required for virus assembly, the oligosaccharides are likely to be involved in the virus\u2013host interaction. In order to investigate the role of the M protein glycosylation in the host, two genetically modified MHVs were generated by using targeted RNA recombination. The recombinant viruses carried M proteins that were either N-glycosylated or not glycosylated at all, and these were compared with the parental, O-glycosylated, virus. The M protein glycosylation state did not influence the tissue culture growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses. However, it affected their interferogenic capacity as measured using fixed, virus-infected cells. Viruses containing M proteins with N-linked sugars induced type I interferons to higher levels than viruses carrying M proteins with O-linked sugars. MHV with unglycosylated M proteins appeared to be a poor interferon inducer. In mice, the recombinant viruses differed in their ability to replicate in the liver, but not in the brain, whereas their in vivo interferogenic capacity did not appear to be affected by their glycosylation status. Strikingly, their abilities to replicate in the liver correlated with their in vitro interferogenic capacity. This apparent correlation might be explained by the functioning of lectins, such as the mannose receptor, which are abundantly expressed in the liver but also play a role in the induction of interferon-\u03B1 by dendritic cells.","publish_time":"2003-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Haan, Cornelis A.M; de Wit, Mar\u00E8l; Kuo, Lili; Montalto-Morrison, Cynthia; Haagmans, Bart L; Weiss, Susan R; Masters, Paul S; Rottier, Peter J.M","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd2b10f512e5cf14644e4fdc1077dce2988d6981.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126936.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203002356; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203002356","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins","O-glycosylated","recombinant viruses","respective virus","virus assembly","N-linked sugars","O-linked sugars","O-glycosylation motifs","protein glycosylation state","virus-infected cells","group","interferogenic capacity","liver","glycosylation status","mouse hepatitis virus","coronaviruses","role","induction of interferon","dendritic cells","host interaction","poor interferon inducer","interferons","tissue culture growth characteristics","higher levels","hydrophilic cover","abundant coronaviral envelope component","types of carbohydrate modifications","virion","outer surface","modified MHVs","targeted RNA recombination","oligosaccharides","brain","ability","functioning of lectins","mannose receptor","mice","conservation","apparent correlation","order","abilities"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, analysis of the binding site\u0027s conformational changes during the simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicated that the virus\u0027 mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors.

This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Zhaoqian; Wu, Yinghao","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8aa6448848055cff7b7ff7f57eb0293e4eacfee0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/78e49fdb6f0aa9924a5b510341d52b618fff0ca6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.958272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","association of new virus","receptor","SARS-CoV","ACE2","S-protein","new type of coronavirus","slower association","nCoV","new disease","novel coronavirus","binding of S","life cycle of virus","difference of association rate","mathematical model","severe acute respiratory syndrome","structural model","molecular level","bio-system","simulation results","innate immune system","multiscale simulation method","higher level of viral concentration","interplay","host cells","possible explanation","spike proteins","human body","complex","longer incubation period","viruses","Angiotensinconverting enzyme","years","control","experimental data","function","issue","China","humans","surfaces","computational study","death"],"language":"en"},

Peptide-based vaccines cannot revert to a virulent form, allow a better conservation, and are produced more easily and safely. However, they generate a weaker immune response than other vaccines, and the inclusion of adjuvants and/or the use of vaccine delivery systems is almost always needed. Among vaccine delivery systems, micro- and nanoparticulated ones are attractive, because their particulate nature can increase cross-presentation of the peptide. In addition, they can be passively or actively targeted to antigen presenting cells. Furthermore, particulate adjuvants are able to directly activate innate immune system in vivo.

Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data. In result, very high possibility has witnessed that the airborne contaminant emitted from the infected patients in the lower floors could be transported to the higher floors through the airflow driven by the stack effect.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Taesub; Cho, Jinkyun; Kim, Byungseon Sean","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8640c30a96939181b74e35809d7c7985db0f89c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115776.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036013231100117X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.04.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231100117X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected patients","airborne contaminant","quarantined patients","general hospital wards","urban general hospitals","scrutinizing stack effect","airborne transmitted viruses","field measurement data","stack effect of vertical chute","indoor airborne virus transmission","high-rise hospital","large hospitals","indoor airflow","influenza viruses","viral contaminant","viral diseases","numerical analysis","higher floors","lower floors","numerical simulation","releasing vertical points","safer ventilation system","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","SARS","outdoor temperature","tracer gas","prediction results","great concern","uncontrolled air movement","recent trend","high possibility","H1N1","healthy visitors","epidemic","human casualties","building","research","infection","spread","countries","Abstract","places","high-rises"],"language":"en"},

Methods A reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted within 15minutesat39\u00B0C with portable instruments after addition of extracted RNA. The clinical performance of RT-RAA assay was evaluated using 947 clinical samples from five institutions in four regions of China, and the approved commercial real-time fluorescent RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) kits were used for parallel detection. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-RAA were compared and analyzed. Results The RT-RAA test results of 926 samples were consistent with those of qRT-PCR (330 were positive, 596 were negative) and 21 were inconsistent. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-RAA was 97.63% [330/338, 95% confidence interval (CI): 95.21 to 98.90] and 97.87% (596/609, 95% CI: 96.28 to 98.81), respectively.

To examine the role of other host factors in MHV infection in mice, IFN-\u03B3-deficient mice with a BALB/c background (BALB-GKO) were infected intraperitoneally with MHV and compared with B6-GKO mice. In contrast to B6-GKO mice, BALB-GKO mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure. The viral titer of the liver in BALB-GKO mice was significantly higher than that in B6-GKO mice. All hepatocytes in BALB-GKO mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection, which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected B6-GKO mice. The serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected BALB-GKO mice were higher than that of B6-GKO mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice.

The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6\u00D7 His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates purification, and can be efficiently cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have purified various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These purified proteins have been used to generate highly specific polyclonal antibodies.

The function of this protein is still unclear. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 and related proteins from cereals grouped together, which diverged from JRL with an additional N-terminal disease response domain.

Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u2018silently\u2019 spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Saraf, Sharada; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Watts, Alexander; Tan, Amanda L.; Oidtman, Rachel J.; Ladner, Jason T.; Oliveira, Glenn; Matteson, Nathaniel L.; Kraemer, Moritz U.G.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Hentoff, Aaron; Bhatia, Deepit; Stanek, Danielle; Scott, Blake; Landis, Vanessa; Stryker, Ian; Cone, Marshall R.; Kopp, Edgar W.; Cannons, Andrew C.; Heberlein-Larson, Lea; White, Stephen; Gillis, Leah D.; Ricciardi, Michael J.; Kwal, Jaclyn; Lichtenberger, Paola K.; Magnani, Diogo M.; Watkins, David I.; Palacios, Gustavo; Hamer, Davidson H.; Gardner, Lauren M.; Alex Perkins, T.; Baele, Guy; Khan, Kamran; Morrison, Andrea; Isern, Sharon; Michael, Scott F.; Andersen, Kristian G.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08660499ee722a74043f8417faee3e1eeb9d0f5f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ac1b4acfb4ae29eb4154efb55de129f114e58fbc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/496901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Europe","Cuba"],"keyphrases":["Americas","sequencing Zika virus","substantial Zika virus transmission","mitigating Zika virus transmission","unreported Zika outbreak","ongoing Zika epidemic","long-lived lineages of Zika virus","travel-associated Zika cases","Cuba","peak transmission","outbreak dynamics","signatures of transmission dynamics","control measures","local reporting","control systems","local case reporting","aggressive mosquito control","large discrepancies","year prior","surveillance gaps","lingering outbreaks","public health surveillance","strong international coordination","herd immunity","significant delays","multiple places","United States","absence of vaccines","response","Europe","neighboring countries","infected travelers","data","locations","framework","study highlights","issue","end"],"language":"en"},

Patients often suffer from opportunistic respiratory infections; chronic pulmonary changes have been found in advanced disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 17-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who was admitted to the hospital with fever, malaise, headache, cough and dyspnea. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates and pneumonia was diagnosed. Despite prompt clinical improvement under antibiotic therapy, interstitial changes remained stable. A high resolution computer tomography showed severe diffuse parenchymal lung disease, while the patient\u2019s pulmonary function tests were normal and he was asymptomatic. Lung tissue biopsy revealed chronic reparative and resorptive reaction with organizing vasculitis. At the time of the initial presentation to the hospital, serological signs of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were present; EBV viremia with atypical serological response persisted during two-year follow up. No other infectious agents were found. Marked monocytopenia combined with B-cell lymphopenia led to a suspicion of GATA-2 deficiency. Diagnosis was confirmed by detection of the previously published heterozygous mutation in GATA2 (c.1081 C \u003E T, p.R361C). The patient\u2019s brother and father were both carriers of the same genetic defect. The brother had no clinically relevant ailments despite leukocyte changes similar to the index patient. The father suffered from spondylarthritis, and apart from B-cell lymphopenia, no other changes within the leukocyte pool were seen. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a diagnosis of GATA-2 deficiency should be considered in all patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease presenting together with leukocytopenia, namely monocyto-, dendritic cell- and B-lymphopenia, irrespective of severity of the clinical phenotype. Genetic counseling and screening for GATA2 mutations within the patient\u2019s family should be provided as the phenotype is highly variable and carriers without apparent immunodeficiency are still in danger of developing myeloid malignancy. A prompt recognition of this rare condition helps to direct clinical treatment strategies and follow-up procedures.","publish_time":"2015-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Svobodova, Tamara; Mejstrikova, Ester; Salzer, Ulrich; Sukova, Martina; Hubacek, Petr; Matej, Radoslav; Vasakova, Martina; Hornofova, Ludmila; Dvorakova, Marcela; Fronkova, Eva; Votava, Felix; Freiberger, Tomas; Pohunek, Petr; Stary, Jan; Janda, Ales","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/917928bee48f4118e1f14349d4176df8281e9cac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4340788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25879889/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-015-0006-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B-cell lymphopenia","chronic pulmonary changes","interstitial changes","dendritic cell","patients","B-lymphopenia","patient\u2019s brother","clinical phenotype","diagnosis of GATA","leukocyte changes similar","severe diffuse parenchymal lung disease","chronic leukocytopenias","hospital","patient\u2019s family","carriers","advanced disease","prompt clinical improvement","myeloid malignancy","suspicion of GATA","CASE PRESENTATION","father","patient\u2019s pulmonary function tests","Lung tissue biopsy","clinical treatment strategies","transcription factor deficiency","EBV viremia","GATA2 mutations","initial presentation","prompt recognition","Genetic counseling","leukocyte pool","genetic defect","atypical serological response","opportunistic respiratory infections","variable phenotypic features","bilateral interstitial infiltrates","serological signs of acute infection","antibiotic therapy","lymphatic vasculature abnormalities","resorptive reaction","high resolution computer tomography","Epstein-Barr virus","increased susceptibility","rare condition","malaise","headache","lymphocytopenia","screening","relevant ailments","organizing vasculitis","chest X-ray","published heterozygous mutation","cough","sensorineural deafness","year-old","detection","fever","pneumonia","follow-up procedures","danger","apparent immunodeficiency","index patient","granulocyto","severity","healthy Caucasian male","R361C","dyspnea","BACKGROUND","propensity","monocytopenia","time","spondylarthritis","infectious agents","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This fear extends from concerns about the present situation, for the health and well-being of family members and loved ones from Covid-19 infection, to fears relating to how long the crisis will last, to the potential economic consequences of the pandemic (perhaps not seen in our lifetimes) and the ultimate fear of future uncertainty. Across the world, health systems are being faced with unprecedented challenges. At their core, these challenges are the same: how to beat Covid-19.

The spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on pediatric ARI in Vietnam. STUDY DESIGN: An ongoing population-based prospective surveillance in central Vietnam was used. All children aged \u003C15 years residing in Nha Trang city, enrolled to the ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, from February 2007 through March 2011 were studied. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected. Influenza A was detected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing. RESULTS: Among enrolled 2736 hospitalized ARI cases, 354 (13%) were positive for influenza A. Genotyping results revealed that seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 (sea-H1N1) viruses were cocirculating before A(H1N1)pdm09 appeared in July 2009. The A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the sea-H1N1 after the pandemic. The majority of influenza A cases (90%) were aged \u003C5 years with incidence rate of 537 (387\u2013775) per 100 000 population. Annual incidence rates of hospitalized influenza cases for pre-, initial and post-pandemic periods among children aged \u003C5 year were 474, 452, and 387 per 100 000, respectively. Children with A(H1N1)pdm09 were elder, visited the hospital earlier, less frequently had severe signs, and were less frequently associated with viral coinfection compared with seasonal influenza cases. CONCLUSIONS: The A(H1N1)pdm09 did not increase the influenza annual hospitalization incidence or disease severity compared with seasonal influenza among pediatric ARI cases in central Vietnam.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le, Minh Nhat; Yoshida, Lay Myint; Suzuki, Motoi; Nguyen, Hien Anh; Le, Huu Tho; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Dang, Duc Anh; Ariyoshi, Koya","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9543d56a69a743e9472e1955f27bfa935ae43942.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4181797.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Khanh Hoa General Hospital","A.

In the past several years, studies have discovered many elegant strategies that viruses have evolved to circumvent the cellular RNA degradation machinery, ranging from disarming the RNA decay pathways and co-opting the factors governing cellular mRNA stability to promoting host mRNA degradation that facilitates selective viral gene expression and alters the dynamics of host-pathogen interaction. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the multifaceted interaction between viruses and cellular mRNA degradation machinery to provide an insight into the regulatory mechanisms that influence gene expression in viral infections.","publish_time":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narayanan, Krishna; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aec5782dbbe2413770cec1f6485b4015ca0ebdc1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3592226bb06d50dd7eff9b57680fadffd63bb5fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3632658.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3632658?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187493991200209X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23274304/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187493991200209X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular gene expression","cellular mRNA degradation machinery","robust cellular RNA degradation machinery","host mRNA degradation","cellular mRNA stability","Messenger RNA degradation","selective viral gene expression","viruses","fundamental cellular process","dynamics of host","viral infections","RNA decay pathways","multifaceted interaction","pathogen interaction","optimal balance","factors","critical role","insight","current knowledge","regulatory mechanisms","productive infection","studies","quality","elegant strategies","abundance of mRNAs","years","cells","past","review"],"language":"en"},

Regulatory molecules termed arrestins are central to this process as is the capacity of AT1R to crosstalk with other receptor systems, such as the widely studied transactivation of growth factor receptors.

Intra-cellular immune signaling is tightly regulated by various post-translational modifications, which allow for this dynamic response. One of the post-translational modifiers critical for immune control is ubiquitin, which can be covalently conjugated to lysines in target molecules, thereby altering their functional properties. This is achieved in a process involving E3 ligases which determine ubiquitination target specificity. One of the most prominent E3 ligase families is that of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, which counts over 70 members in humans. Over the last years, various studies have contributed to the notion that many members of this protein family are important immune regulators. Recent studies into the mechanisms by which some of the TRIMs regulate the innate immune system have uncovered important immune regulatory roles of both covalently attached, as well as unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains. This review highlights TRIM evolution, recent findings in TRIM-mediated immune regulation, and provides an outlook to current research hurdles and future directions.","publish_time":"2014-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Versteeg, Gijs A.; Benke, Stefan; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Rajsbaum, Ricardo","journal":"Cytokine Growth Factor Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb38a06c25822674160df4ab649994f2d34cc69b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173094.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610114000847; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2014.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25172371/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610114000847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune regulation","immune response","immune control","important immune regulators","innate immune system","exacerbated immune activation","Intra-cellular immune","important immune regulatory roles","Recent studies","members","various studies","post-translational modifiers critical","various post-translational modifications","recent findings","review highlights TRIM evolution","negative regulation","E3 ligases","target molecules","dynamic response","ubiquitination target specificity","prominent E3 ligase families","unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains","detrimental effects","outlook","right balance","protein family","current research hurdles","anti-microbial defense","future directions","tripartite motif","proteins","TRIMs","notion","process","mechanisms","functional properties","lysines","years","humans"],"language":"en"},

The importance of H. somni diseases can be attributed to improved clinical and laboratory recognition, combined with the growth in intensive management practices for cattle. Although outbreaks of bovine histophilosis can occur year-round, in northern and southern hemispheres, it is most frequent in late fall and early winter. Weather, stress, dietary changes, and comingling of cattle are likely to be major triggers for outbreaks. The most frequent clinical expressions of histophilosis include undifferentiated fever, fibrinosuppurative pneumonia, encephalitis-leptomeningitis, necrotizing myocarditis, and diffuse pleuritis. Neurological disease occurs either as thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME) or as suppurative meningitis with ventriculitis. Acute myocarditis is characteristically necrotizing and generally involves one or both papillary muscles in the left ventricular myocardium. Biofilm-like aggregates of bacteria occur in capillaries and veins in myocardium, in the central nervous system, and on endocardial surfaces. H. somni is a component of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. In our experience, it is most commonly diagnosed in subacute-to-chronic polymicrobial pulmonary infections in combination with Mannheimia haemolytica, Trueperella pyogenes, Pasteurella multocida, or Mycoplasma bovis. Other, less common forms of H. somni disease present as polyarthritis/tenosynovitis, abortion with placentitis and fetal septicemia, epididymitis-orchitis, and ocular infections. It is likely that H. somni is under-recognized clinically and diagnostically. Most state and provincial laboratories in North America rely on bacterial isolation to confirm infection. The use of more sensitive detection methods on field cases of histophilosis will help resolve the pathogenesis of H. somni in natural outbreaks, and whether the disease is as common elsewhere as it is in Canada.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Toole, D.; Sondgeroth, K.

Focusing on the COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.

Isolate I0305/19 and other GI-19 viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110 -112 in the S protein. Further analysis based on the complete genomic sequence showed that the isolate emerged through at least four recombination events between GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848- and GI-13 4/91-like strains, in which the S gene was found to be similar to that of the GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-like strain.

The isolate I0305/19 exhibited broader tropisms in different tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils. Furthermore, subpopulations of the challenge virus were found in tissues of infected chickens; this finding is important in understanding how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease.

One way to stop spreading over the airline network are travel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on the total number of passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using edge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting traffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network. We employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of cities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500 airports, and tests different flight cancellation methods for limiting the course of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as simulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate control strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the level of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global airline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading infected 37% less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections between cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy of closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections only reduced infections by 18%. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single connections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in fewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole airports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers while producing the same reduction in infections.

Using human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) isolated from dengue cases and structure-guided design of a chimeric DENV, here we describe the major site on the DENV2 envelope (E) protein targeted by neutralizing antibodies. DENV2-specific neutralizing hMAb 2D22 binds to a quaternary structure epitope. We engineered and recovered a recombinant DENV4 that displayed the 2D22 epitope. DENV2 neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to infection or a live vaccine tracked with the 2D22 epitope on the DENV4/2 chimera. The chimera remained sensitive to DENV4 antibodies, indicating that the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV2 and -4 are at different sites. The ability to transplant a complex epitope between DENV serotypes demonstrates a hitherto underappreciated structural flexibility in flaviviruses, which could be harnessed to develop new vaccines and diagnostics.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallichotte, E.

Our objectives were to estimate the relative contribution of HMPV to hospitalization in children with acute respiratory infection, to define the clinical and epidemiological features of HMPV single and multiple infections, and to compare HMPV infections with respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus and human bocavirus infections in the same population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study performed on all children less than 14 years of age with a respiratory tract disease admitted to a secondary hospital between September 2005- June 2014. Clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken at admission for viral study with polymerase chain reaction for 16 respiratory viruses. A total of 3,906 children were included. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. The most common identified virus was HRSV, followed by HRV. HMPV was detected in 214 cases (5.5%); 133 (62%) were single infections and the remaining were detected in coinfection with other viruses. 90.7% cases were detected between February and May. Children\u2019s mean age was 13.83 \u00B1 18 months. Fever was frequent (69%), and bronchiolitis (27%), and recurrent wheezing (63%) were the main clinical diagnosis. Hypoxia was present in 65% of the patients and 47% of them had an infiltrate in X-ray. Only 6 (2.8%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit. Only the duration of the hospitalization was different, being longer in the coinfections group (p \u003C0.05). There were many differences in seasonality and clinical characteristics between HMPV and other respiratory viruses being more similar to HRSV. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV infections accounted for 5.5% of total viral infections in hospitalized children. The clinical characteristics were similar to HRSV infections, but seasonality and clinical data were different from other viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Rey, Cristina; D\u00EDaz, Beatriz; Molinero, Maria del Mar; Pozo, Francisco; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77984a8d832663c5cd43e17e34a37470b3d95406.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5354294.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28301570/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173504","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":["HMPV","HRV","HRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMPV infections","HRSV infections","single infections","multiple infections","respiratory viruses","acute lower respiratory infections","total viral infections","human bocavirus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","Clinical characteristics of patients","clinical data","hospitalized children","acute respiratory infection","respiratory tract disease","relative contribution of HMPV","epidemiological features of HMPV single","main clinical diagnosis","viral study","seasonality","hospitalization","years of age","HRV","cases","common identified virus","prospective study","Human metapneumovirus","Children\u2019s mean age","important etiological role","polymerase chain reaction","admission","rhinovirus","adenovirus","secondary hospital","METHODS","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","remaining","population","differences","intensive care unit","coinfections group","Nasopharyngeal aspirate","objectives","months","duration","CONCLUSIONS","Fever","recurrent wheezing","infiltrate","X-ray","Hypoxia","bronchiolitis"],"language":"en"},

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"1984-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorensen, O.; Coulter-Mackie, M.

In addition, several other alphaviruses, for instance Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus, potentially cause fatal encephalitis in humans. These diseases are considered as neglected tropical diseases for which there are no current antiviral therapies or vaccines available. The replication process in alphaviruses depends on four nonstructural proteins, NSP1\u2013NSP4, which are produced as a single polyprotein. Therefore, the Alphavirus-mediated diseases in humans remain challenging among the virologists worldwide. Thus researchers are trying to find out proficient approaches, including the discovery of novel chemotherapeutic agents for the possible management and treatment of infected patients. Attempts were also made to identify an active compound against alphaviruses from natural sources. The genomes of various alphaviruses have already been revealed, and the function of proteins may be predicted by homology modeling, with the known proteins of closely related viruses. With the help of this information of protein modeling and subsequent virtual screening approach, the research teams will be able to identify few potential leads. The drug discovery against various alphaviruses is still in its early stages. Moreover, consolidating the available information and making it available for the scientific community are urgent requirements to expedite the research of potential drug discovery. The current chapter describes the techniques available to prevent Alphavirus infection and to treat Alphavirus-associated malignancies. In addition, we also discuss the recent outcomes in the fields of synthetic and natural medicinal chemistry research that were solely aimed to fight against Alphavirus infection. Thus the present chapter may also help and expedite the drug discovery and development of inhibitors against nonstructural proteins of various alphaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bissoyi, Akalabya; Pattanayak, Subrat K.; Bit, Arindam; Patel, Ashish; Singh, Abhishek K.; Behera, Sudhanshu S.; Satpathy, Debabrata","journal":"Viral Proteases and Their Inhibitors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97faf831b7be5bfbf771bba9ca3365728ac23029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173589.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128097120000046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128097120000046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Eastern"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonstructural proteins of various alphaviruses","genomes of various alphaviruses","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","Western equine encephalitis virus","Nyong virus","Chikungunya virus","instance Eastern equine encephalitis virus","available information","research of potential drug discovery","known proteins","Alphavirus-mediated diseases","Alphavirus infection","Ross River virus","fatal encephalitis","techniques available","vaccines available","function of proteins","rheumatic diseases","tropical diseases","research teams","humans","current chapter","Alphavirus-associated malignancies","help","addition","natural medicinal chemistry research","discovery of novel chemotherapeutic agents","information of protein modeling","homology modeling","natural sources","potential leads","present chapter","current antiviral therapies","subsequent virtual screening approach","possible management","fields of synthetic","O\u2019Nyong","development of inhibitors","urgent requirements","treatment of infected patients","scientific community","active compound","recent outcomes","fever","rash","proficient approaches","related viruses","NSP1","NSP4","replication process","early stages","virologists","single polyprotein","researchers","Attempts"],"language":"en"},

Objective We assessed which inflammatory mediators were released from bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) after infection with rhinovirus and then determined whether they were also present in subjects with acute virus-induced asthma, with the aim to identify a biomarker or biomarkers for acute virus-induced asthma. Methods BECs were obtained from bronchial brushings of steroid-naive asthmatic subjects and healthy nonatopic control subjects. Cells were infected with rhinovirus 16. Inflammatory mediators were measured by means of flow cytometry with a cytometric bead array. Subjects with acute asthma and virus infection were recruited; they were characterized clinically by using lung function tests and had blood taken to measure the inflammatory mediators identified as important by the BEC experiments. Results IFN-\u03B3\u2013induced protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES were released in the greatest quantities, followed by IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03B1. Dexamethasone treatment of BECs only partially suppressed IP-10 and TNF-\u03B1 but was more effective at suppressing RANTES, IL-6, and IL-8. In acute clinical asthma serum IP-10 levels were increased to a greater extent in those with acute virus-induced asthma (median of 604 pg/mL compared with 167 pg/mL in those with non\u2013virus-induced acute asthma, P \u003C .01). Increased serum IP-10 levels were predictive of virus-induced asthma (odds ratio, 44.3 [95% CI, 3.9-100.3]). Increased serum IP-10 levels were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction (r = \u22120.8; P \u003C .01). Conclusions IP-10 release is specific to acute virus-induced asthma.

For this we merge techniques which have been introduced and developed in modern mathematical physics, largely by Ludvig Faddeev to describe objects such as solitons and Higgs and to explain phenomena such as anomalies in gauge fields. We propose a synthesis that can help to resolve the protein folding problem, one of the most important conundrums in all of science. We apply the concept of gauge invariance to scrutinize the extrinsic geometry of strings in three dimensional space. We evoke general principles of symmetry in combination with Wilsonian universality and derive an essentially unique Landau-Ginzburg energy that describes the dynamics of a generic string-like configuration in the far infrared. We observe that the energy supports topological solitons, that pertain to an anomaly in the manner how a string is framed around its inflection points. We explain how the solitons operate as modular building blocks from which folded proteins are composed. We describe crystallographic protein structures by multi-solitons with experimental precision, and investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of proteins under varying temperature.

In total, relative quantitative data were identified for 4333 proteins in PRV and mock- infected PK15 cells, among which 466 cellular proteins were differentially expressed, including 234 upregulated proteins and 232 downregulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that most of these differentially expressed proteins were involved in metabolic processes, cellular growth and proliferation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Moreover, expression levels of four representative proteins, beta-catenin, STAT1, GRB2 and PCNA, were further confirmed by western blot analysis. This is the first attempt to analyze the protein profile of PRV-infected PK15 cells using iTRAQ technology, and our findings may provide valuable information to help understand the host response to PRV infection.","publish_time":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Songbai; Pei, Yue; Zhao, Ayong","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff449311692ce29ca9d598747ab871602adb297f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5379687.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep45922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular proteins","PRV infection","representative proteins","upregulated proteins","downregulated proteins","PRV-infected PK15 cells","protein profile of PRV","mock- infected PK15 cells","cellular growth","stress response","iTRAQ technology","host responses","Bioinformatics analysis","relative quantitative data","western blot analysis","proliferation","endoplasmic reticulum","beta-catenin","isobaric tags","severe economic losses","cell adhesion","absolute quantification","STAT1","metabolic processes","liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","PCNA","pig industry","GRB2","findings","cytoskeleton","valuable information","expression levels","important pathogens of swine","total","understanding","attempt","Pseudorabies virus"],"language":"en"},

In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized \u201Cshortage\u201D definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health and to rationalize the problem-solving strategies adopted in all different settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola","journal":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed339c510d8ee43a74875f36bca0d3a1dc86de20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125892.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517320301551; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517320301551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32092455/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Healthcare Systems","European Regulatory Authorities","EMA","European Economic Area"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulatory issues","current European regulatory framework","capability of European Regulatory Authorities","European countries","European Economic Area","Abstract Medicine shortages","healthcare professionals","unavailability impact","capability of National Healthcare Systems","healthcare assistance services","demand-related ones","suitable problem-solving strategies","manufacturing issues","substantial impact","public health","univocal definition","public communication","harmonized procedure","fluctuating drug demand","pharmaceutical distribution chain","unavailability of medicinal products","supply-related factors","tendering","parallel market","EEA","logistics","Brexit","price","guidance","HMA joint task force","manufacturers","lack","years","fragmentation","reimbursement policies","extraordinary geopolitical events","activities of regulators","continuity of care","cases","different settings","stakeholders","medicines\u2019 availability","multifactorial causes","algorithm","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The \u201CAdministrative Issues\u201D section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. \u201CLegal Issues\u201D discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early identification, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory pathogens. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rothman, Richard E.; Irvin, Charlene B.; Moran, Gregory J.; Sauer, Lauren; Bradshaw, Ylisabyth S.; Fry, Robert B.; Josephson, Elaine B.; Ledyard, Holly K.; Hirshon, Jon Mark","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c57bac4f38795dc13c7f91af3b758a0199ef3d2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115302.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064406007037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064406007037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Effective respiratory hygiene","infected ED patient","effective respiratory control measures","respiratory disease transmission","patient care section","lethal respiratory pathogens","patient crowding","patient privacy","patient transport","ED treatment area","severe acute respiratory syndrome","spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens","control of acute respiratory infectious threats","health care workers","hospital care","public health departments","health care worker protection","Disease Control","Administrative Issues","legal issues","public health response plan","effective facility planning","public safety","procedures","triage planning","Emergency physicians","emergency department","avian influenza","inadequate staffing","practical information","staffing optimization","emergency medical services concerns","bioterrorism agents","current information available","ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients","resources","education","coordination","references","critical role","Centers","containment","essential component","interplay","literature","early identification","specific recommendations","Potential physical sites","visitors","summary","inpatient populations","room","appropriate policies","brief synopsis","clinicians","administrators","vaccination","Prevention","Threat of contagion","article"],"language":"en"},

This relationship is probably related to the commercial exchange of pigs between the US and Mexico and the geographical proximity of these two countries.","publish_time":"2019-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez\u2010Rivera, Claudia; Ram\u00EDrez\u2010Mendoza, Humberto; Mendoza\u2010Elvira, Susana; Segura\u2010Vel\u00E1zquez, Rene; S\u00E1nchez\u2010Betancourt, Jos\u00E9 Ivan","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22de9b9663d0a35f8dcbb2424afdd0d99365a80f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941894/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico","United States"],"keyphrases":["Porcine deltacoronavirus","Mexico","rectal samples","positive samples","total samples","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","great economic losses","multiplex RT","PCR","frequent coinfection","glycosylation site","swine industry","geographical proximity","characterization","commercial exchange of pigs","antigenic regions","coinfections","sequencing","addition","Spike gene","sequences of Mexican isolates","detection","strains","countries","United States","relationship","study"],"language":"en"},

However, there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions. The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype. METHODS: We present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions. We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions. RESULTS: All three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic. Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years. Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21). CONCLUSION: The large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities. Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.","publish_time":"2010-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Eric HY; Hsiung, C Agnes; Cowling, Benjamin J; Chen, Chang-Hsun; Ho, Lai-Ming; Tsang, Thomas; Chang, Chiu-Wen; Donnelly, Christl A; Leung, Gabriel M","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e9494784505c616553ef19805fb9dd82c89dea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2846944.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20205928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["regions","onset","confidence interval","SARS patients","SARS epidemiology","epidemiological studies of SARS","AOR","admission interval","clinical variables","clinical characteristics","large differences","clinical heterogeneities","comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS","crude fatality ratios","similar incubation periods","higher fatality","case fatality ratios","CFRs","death periods","similar host","large discrepancy","epidemiologic features","emerging epidemic","interconnected world","adjusted odds ratio","health care worker status","public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks","nosocomial setting","populations","Beijing","older age","Hong Kong","Taiwan","progressive shortening","importance","common data collection platform","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","integrated dataset","viral genotype","sex","consistencies","similarities","presenting symptoms","discharge","Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions","greater mortality","order","CONCLUSION","study","influence of demographic","individuals","findings","deaths","METHODS","RESULTS","aim","BACKGROUND","years"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods The anticomplementary activity was evaluated from hemolytic assays through the classical pathway (CP) and the alternative pathway (AP) of complement system in vitro. Compounds were isolated using bioactivity-guided fractionation and tested in vitro for their complement-inhibiting properties on the CP and AP. HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS was used to assign the isolated compounds in the five ingredient herbs. Results 15 compounds, including chlorogenic acid (1), rutin (2), hyperoside (3), p-hydroxyacephenone (4), scopoletin (5), quercitrin (6) (3R,4R,6S)-3,6-dihydroxy-1-menthene (7), acaciin (8), scoparone (9), luteolin (10), quercetin (11), apigenin (12), acacetin (13), aristolactam (14), and apigenin-7,4\u2032-dimethyl ether (15) were isolated and identified. Nine flavonoids (2, 3, 6, 8, 10\u201313, 15) were found to show inhibitory effects towards the CP and AP of complement system, luteolin (10) was the most potent with the CH50 and AP50 values of 0.19 and 0.17mM. The bioactive flavonoids were mainly derived from Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae. Conclusions A Chinese multiherb remedy used for the treatment and prevention of SARS has robust inhibitory effect on complement system through the CP and AP, and its anticomplementary activity could be attributed to the flavonoids present in some ingredient herbs. Luteolin could be a potential anticomplementary agent.","publish_time":"2008-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ting; Chen, Daofeng","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74d612b9e51197a20a79042c5c81fb264354be99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126446.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874108000755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874108000755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fructus Tsaoko"],"organizations":["SARS","CP","AP","Herba Artemisiae Scopariae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CP","AP of complement system","Herba Artemisiae Scopariae","Herba Eupatorii","anticomplementary activity","luteolin","isolated compounds","ingredients of Herba Houttuyniae","anticomplementary principles","Flos Chrysanthemi Indici","treatment","Chinese multiherb remedy","prevention of SARS","potential anticomplementary agent","ingredient herbs","apigenin","flavonoids present","bioactive flavonoids","alternative pathway","classical pathway","inhibitory effects","robust inhibitory effect","hemolytic assays","HPLC-DAD","Fructus Tsaoko","chlorogenic acid","study","ESI-MS","CH50","AP50 values","rutin","Results","bioactivity-guided fractionation","dimethyl ether","Materials","methods","Conclusions","properties","p-hydroxyacephenone","menthene","scopoletin","acaciin","hyperoside","dihydroxy","Abstract Aim","acacetin","aristolactam","quercitrin","scoparone","quercetin"],"language":"en"},

The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszky\u2019s disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszky\u2019s disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. RESULTS: Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszky\u2019s disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (ADV) in the wild boar population in Serbia although seroconversion has been detected previously.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milicevic, V.; Radojicic, S.; Valcic, M.; Ivovic, V.; Radosavljevic, V.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c760ba658ba0d10b96cf738e04f83f22bd15f3a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4928280.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0758-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27357597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Suid Herpesvirus","ADV","AD"],"locations":["Serbia"],"keyphrases":["PCR positive wild boars","wild boar population","Aujeszky\u2019s disease eradication","evidence of Aujeszky\u2019s disease","demonstration of Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus","clinical symptoms of Aujeszky\u2019s disease","ADV isolates","viral disease of suids","signs of ADV","eastern Serbia","presence of ADV active infection","tissue samples","domestic animals","isolation of Suid Herpesvirus","recent infection","possibility of active infection","serum samples","clinical signs","virus neutralisation test","national vaccination programme of domestic pigs","viral genome","cause of AD","high homology","partial sequences","us9","ul49","PK15 cell line","syncytia","polymerase chain reaction","cytopathic effect","sera","VNT","CPE","link","distribution","SHV1","relationship","seroconversion","Genetic analysis of us4","significant economic impact","RESULTS","species","BACKGROUND","Neutralizing antibodies","study","aim","CONCLUSIONS","mind"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. RESULTS: 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen\u0027s kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). CONCLUSIONS: Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Jian-Long; Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhen-Dong; Lyu, Jian-Xun; Ng, Ming-Yen; Shen, Xin-Ping; Wen, Zhibo","journal":"Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7893614bbea079ad5c1b3128e02ec8511adf84e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4e1ef6274be3b2dc2398d24246bd9a98b8df129c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364959/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120301207?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120301207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Chest CT","performance of initial RT-PCR","negative initial RT-PCR","serial RT-PCR","performance of CT","negative PCR","CT images","suspected patients","diagnostic value of CT","identification of suspected COVID","absence of COVID","comparable diagnostic performance","comprehensive strategy","specific training","higher sensitivity","good interobserver agreement","reference standard","image readers","final diagnoses","potential risk of false","Cohen\u0027s kappa","presence","epicentre","infection","Wuhan","coronavirus disease","radiologists","METHODS","time","CONCLUSIONS","statistical difference","epidemic center","China","RESULTS","hospital","MATERIALS","INTRODUCTION","additional benefit","specificity","consensus"],"language":"en"},

The cellular regulation of IBV pathogenesis and the host immune responses involved remain to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators of numerous cellular processes, including responses to viral infections. Here, we employed a high-throughput sequencing approach to analyze the miRNA composition of the spleen and the lungs of chicken embryos upon IBV infection. Compared to healthy chicken embryos, 13 and six miRNAs were upregulated in the spleen and the lungs, respectively, all predicted to influence viral transcription, cytokine production, and lymphocyte functioning. Subsequent downregulation of NFATC3, NFAT5, SPPL3, and TGFB2 genes in particular was observed only in the spleen, demonstrating the biological functionality of the miRNAs in this lymphoid organ. This is the first study that describes the modulation of miRNAs and the related host immune factors by IBV in chicken embryos. Our data provide novel insight into complex virus-host interactions and specifically highlight components that could affect the host\u2019s immune response to IBV infection.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56 \u00B0C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. RESULTS: Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yang; Long, Luyao; Zhang, Daitao; Yan, Tingting; Cui, Shujuan; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi; Ren, Simei","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f37db64e5c752c16ecb31debb4cbc5db69ba1969.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR negative","RT-PCR tests","effects of thermal inactivation","heat inactivation","quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS","efficiency of RT","negative results","results of viral","chemical inactivation approach","specimens","SARS-CoV","thermal incubation","fewer false negatives","rates of false","diagnosed COVID","management of COVID","Nucleic acid testing","increased Ct values","nucleic acid integrity","weak-positive samples","chemical inactivators","parallel testing","sample preservation times","Corona Virus Disease","low viral loads","single-stranded RNA virus","effects of different specimen types","real-time polymerase chain reaction","work","patients","overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","smaller impact","important role","patient diagnosis","based lysis","NAT","approaches","use of guanidinium","limited applicability","BACKGROUND","half","procedure","regard","detection","circumstances","METHODS","CONCLUSION","world","end"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the identification and isolation of vaccine strains of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV1) and avian coronaviruses (ACoV) from different wild bird species across eight Egyptian governorates between January 2014 and December 2015. Surveillance of avian respiratory viruses in free-ranging wild birds (n = 297) identified three species that harboured or excreted APMV1 and ACoVs. Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of recovered viruses revealed a close association with the most widely utilized vaccine strains in the country. These results highlight the potential spillover of vaccine-viruses probably due to extensive use of live-attenuated vaccines in the commercial poultry, and close interaction between domesticated and wild bird populations. Further exploring the full spectrum of vaccine-derived viral vaccine strains in wild birds might help to assess the emergence of future wild-birds origin viruses.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohaim, M.A.; El Naggar, R.F.; Helal, A.M.; Hussein, H.A.; Munir, Muhammad","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bc3441afe8aa103e7b28ceda7be4abc13471d8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173293.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17306576; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17306576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533052/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild birds","wild bird populations","utilized vaccine strains","emergence of future wild-birds origin viruses","spectrum of vaccine","Transmission of viruses","different wild bird species","derived viral vaccine strains","Surveillance of avian respiratory viruses","isolation of vaccine strains of avian paramyxovirus serotype","potential spillover of vaccine","commercial poultry","phylogenetic analysis of recovered viruses","avian coronaviruses","close interaction","close association","excreted APMV1","attenuated vaccines","emerging paradigm of livestock","extensive use of live","Genetic characterization","Egyptian governorates","wildlife interface","results","country","identification","ACoVs"],"language":"en"},

In humans, IAV is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal infections associated with significant morbidity in young and elderly populations, and has a large economic impact. Moreover, IAV has the potential to cause both zoonotic spillover infection and global pandemics, which have significantly greater morbidity and mortality across all ages. The pathology associated with these pandemic and spillover infections appear to be the result of an excessive inflammatory response leading to severe lung damage, which likely predisposes the lungs for secondary bacterial infections. The lung is protected from pathogens by alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, tissue resident alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. The importance of mast cells during bacterial and parasitic infections has been extensively studied; yet, the role of these hematopoietic cells during viral infections is only beginning to emerge. Recently, it has been shown that mast cells can be directly activated in response to IAV, releasing mediators such histamine, proteases, leukotrienes, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral chemokines, which participate in the excessive inflammatory and pathological response observed during IAV infections. In this review, we will examine the relationship between mast cells and IAV, and discuss the role of mast cells as a potential drug target during highly pathological IAV infections. Finally, we proposed an emerging role for mast cells in other viral infections associated with significant host pathology.","publish_time":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Amy C.; Temple, Rachel M.; Obar, Joshua J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29621887690af716dac0c244eeb95bce74fa8755.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4435071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26042121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of mast cells","importance of mast cells","pathological IAV infections","endothelial cells","dendritic cells","hematopoietic cells","viral infections","spillover infections","seasonal infections","parasitic infections","alveolar epithelial cells","secondary bacterial infections","excessive inflammatory response","pathological response","inflammatory cytokines","significant morbidity","emerging role","significant host pathology","greater morbidity","potential drug target","zoonotic spillover infection","severe lung damage","tissue resident alveolar macrophages","leukotrienes","global pandemics","elderly populations","mammalian","proteases","histamine","mediators","pathogens","respiratory pathogen","result","widespread infectious agent","antiviral chemokines","lungs","relationship","large economic impact","mortality","virus","humans","avian species","Influenza","review"],"language":"en"},

Skin cells, in particular fibroblasts have a relatively high level of APN/CD13 expression. The migratory capacity of skin cells is critical for the outcome of wound repair, as successful wound healing requires timely re-epithelialization which involves reformation of epithelium over wound surface by migrating keratinocytes. While failure of keratinocytes to undergo proper migration leads to chronic non-healing wounds, the presence of excess fibroblasts may contribute to formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of APN/CD13 in skin cell migration and explore its potential as a therapeutic target in wound healing. Our results show an elevated expression of APN/CD13 in fibroblasts on the edge of the wound compared to unwounded cells. The presence of anti-APN/CD13 antibodies WM15, 3D8, and H300 reduces the migratory activity of human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner by 42, 21, and 28%, respectively. However, the antibodies have no effect on keratinocyte migration. Further, none of the anti-APN/CD13 antibodies used in this study has any antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on primary human keratinocytes or fibroblasts when used at 10 \u03BCg/ml in vitro. The differential inhibition on the migratory capacity of fibroblasts and keratinocytes presents an opportunity for anti-APN/CD13 antibodies to be used as a therapeutic agent for high fibroblast cellularity seen in fibroproliferative disorders.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Amy; Ghaffari, Abdi; Ghahary, Aziz","journal":"Mol Cell Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a88936aa114bd4da0270905b0e535456679c2b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088764.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0513-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20589526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Aminopeptidase N","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13 expression","CD13 antibodies WM15","presence of anti-APN","role of APN","migratory capacity of fibroblasts","skin cell migration","particular fibroblasts","high level of APN","elevated expression of APN","successful wound healing","presence of excess fibroblasts","wound surface","migratory capacity of skin cells","migratory activity of human dermal fibroblasts","cell type","proper migration","keratinocyte migration","failure of keratinocytes","outcome of wound repair","primary human keratinocytes","cancer cell metastasis","study","unwounded cells","chronic non-healing wounds","cytotoxic effect","therapeutic agent","therapeutic target","high fibroblast cellularity","tissue origin","cholesterol uptake","timely re-epithelialization","angiogenesis","reformation of epithelium","H300","3D8","potential","opportunity","antiproliferative","apoptosis","fibroproliferative disorders","myriad of physiological processes","formation of hypertrophic scars","dose-dependent manner","edge","differential inhibition","keloids","results","Aminopeptidase N","transmembrane ectoenzyme","aim","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was \u003C40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p\u003C0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Fu, Yang; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80dd29275b108a285e87d758696af727a28a8318.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221519/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day","patients","IgM","IgG","antibody response","antibody detections","onset","clinical values of antibody testing","negative antibody findings","course of SARS","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","total antibodies","higher titer of Ab","dynamics of antibodies","week","presence of antibodies","infection","vital clinical information","worse clinical classification","lack of blood samples","serial plasma samples","seroconversion rate","management of COVID","RNA detectability","sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis","median seroconversion time","routine application of serological testing","strong empirical support","later stage of illness","infected patient","disease progress","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","reason","early phase","contrast","hospitalization","METHODS","emerging virus","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Possible explanations may be sought either in mechanisms altering the structure of the network of contacts, such as those induced by changes in the rates of movement of people or by public health measures, or in the genetic drift of the influenza virus, since the appearance of new strains can reduce or eliminate herd immunity. The pandemic outbreaks may also be influenced by coinfection with other acute respiratory infections (ARI) that increase transmissibility of influenza virus (by coughing, sneezing, running nose). In fact, some viruses (e.g., Rhinovirus and Adenovirus) have been found to induce \u201Cclouds\u201D of bacteria and increase the transmissibility of Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were detected in patients during past pandemics, and their presence is linked to superspreading events. In this paper, by assuming increased transmissibility in coinfected individuals, we propose and study a model where multiple pandemic waves are triggered by coinfection with ARI. The model agrees well with mortality excess data during the 1918 pandemic influenza, thereby providing indications for potential pandemic mitigation.","publish_time":"2008-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merler, Stefano; Poletti, Piero; Ajelli, Marco; Caprile, Bruno; Manfredi, Piero","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1026a224b61ae21079fcc5680b0cc6afef335523.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094108.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519308003056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308003056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606170/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.06.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","transmissibility of influenza virus","past influenza pandemics","Spanish influenza","pandemic outbreaks","multiple pandemic waves","increased transmissibility","coinfection","past pandemics","ARI","potential pandemic mitigation","model","Adenovirus","Rhinovirus","transmissibility of Staphylococcus aureus","Abstract Sequences of epidemic waves","people","coughing","indications","public health measures","mortality excess data","genetic drift","acute respiratory infections","rates of movement","appearance of new strains","presence","sneezing","patients","mechanisms","structure","bacteria","coinfected individuals","viruses","network of contacts","herd immunity","superspreading events","changes","nose","paper","Possible explanations","clouds","fact"],"language":"en"},

We use two different tourism variables\u2014international tourism receipts and number of international tourist arrivals. To employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for a structural break, the empirical evidence clearly shows that the causality between tourism and economic growth is bi-directional. Lastly, the international and cross-strait political change, economic shocks, and the relaxing of some tourism control and policies would break down the stability of the relationships between tourism development and economic growth.

The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150\u2013250ng per 109 CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.","publish_time":"2006-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveira, Maria Leonor Sarno; Ar\u00EAas, Ana Paula Mattos; Campos, Ivana Barros; Monedero, Vicente; Perez-Mart\u00EDnez, Gaspar; Miyaji, Eliane Namie; Leite, Luciana Cezar Cerqueira; Aires, Karina Ara\u00FAjo; Lee Ho, Paulo","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fccb857b14fc2cff246d8907aab3576367993ed8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110601.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457905004053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457905004053","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal mucosa","Lactobacillus helveticus","Lactobacillus plantarum","mucosal sites","IgG","mucosal vaccination experiments","Lactobacillus casei","different mucosal immunization strategies","PsaA protein","nasal inoculation of C57Bl","low levels of IgA","Abstract Mucosal epithelia","Lactococcus lactis","certain Lactobacillus strains","lactis MG1363","Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen","anti-PsaA antibodies","induction of protective IgA","recombinant lactobacilli","different species of lactic acid bacteria","helveticus ATCC15009","pneumoniae recovery","plantarum NCDO1193","promising results","prevention of infection","bronchial washes","intrinsic properties","delivery of antigens","suitable candidates","highest antibody response","location","decrease","saliva","live vectors","ability","barriers","mice","work","short persistence","serum","colonization challenge","years","days","pathogens","CFU"],"language":"en"},

Infection with DENs can cause severe flu-like illness and potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever. Although RNA interference triggered by long-length dsRNA was considered a potent antiviral pathway in the mosquito, only limited studies of the value of small interfering RNA (siRNA) have been conducted. RESULTS: A 21 nt siRNA targeting the membrane glycoprotein precursor gene of DEN-1 was synthesized and transfected into mosquito C6/36 cells followed by challenge with DEN. The stability of the siRNA in cells was monitored by flow cytometry. The antiviral effect of siRNA was evaluated by measurement of cell survival rate using the MTT method and viral RNA was quantitated with real-time RT-PCR. The presence of cells containing siRNA at 0.25, 1, 3, 5, 7 days after transfection were 66.0%, 52.1%, 32.0%, 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. After 7 days incubation with DEN, there was reduced cytopathic effect, increased cell survival rate (76.9 \u00B1 4.5% vs 23.6 \u00B1 14.6%) and reduced viral RNA copies (Ct value 19.91 \u00B1 0.63 vs 14.56 \u00B1 0.39) detected in transfected C6/36 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that synthetic siRNA against the DEN-1 membrane glycoprotein precursor gene effectively inhibited DEN-1 viral RNA replication and increased C6/36 cell survival rate. siRNA may offer a potential new strategy for prevention and treatment of DEN infection.","publish_time":"2010-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xinwei; Hong, Hua; Yue, Jinya; Wu, Yejian; Li, Xiangzhong; Jiang, Liyun; Li, Lei; Li, Qiaoyan; Gao, Guoquan; Yang, Xia","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c6d1fc20495ba6b8b43ffe06cc0d9bb80244d96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2965154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20946645/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-270","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","DEN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nt siRNA","synthetic siRNA","antiviral effect of siRNA","inhibited DEN","viral RNA replication","viral RNA copies","RNA interference","mosquito C6","increased cell survival rate","treatment of DEN infection","membrane glycoprotein precursor gene of DEN","measurement of cell survival rate","increased C6","transfected C6","presence of cells","value of small interfering RNA","DENs","vs","wildest transmitted mosquito","Ct value","cytopathic effect","days incubation","sub-tropical regions","potent antiviral pathway","pathogens","prevention","MTT method","potential new strategy","illness","length dsRNA","limited studies","severe flu","Dengue viruses","fatal hemorrhagic fever","real-time RT-PCR","BACKGROUND","data","challenge","stability","flow cytometry","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","transfection"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported that recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) in vitro. However, it is unclear whether IL-35 can attenuate nasal allergic responses and symptoms of allergic rhinitis in vivo. Methods To investigate the in vivo effect of IL-35 on allergic rhinitis in mice, mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Intranasal administration of rIL-35 and intranasal challenge of OVA were then performed. Nasal symptoms were estimated after the last nasal challenge. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected. OVA-specific IgE in sera, OVA-specific T cell response, and the production of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) stimulated by the OVA antigen were measured. The transcription level of Foxp3 and the frequency of CD4\u002BCD25\u002B regulatory T cells were also measured. Results rIL-35 significantly inhibited the number of sneezes and nasal rubbing movements. It also reduced the number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa and significantly decreased the level of OVA-specific IgE, the OVA-specific T cell proliferation, and the production of IL-4 and IL-5. Furthermore, rIL-35 significantly increased the production of IL-10, the transcription level of Foxp3, and the frequency of CD4\u002BCD25\u002B regulatory T cells. Conclusions This study showed for the first time that rIL-35 inhibits nasal allergic responses and symptoms in mice, and that rIL-35 increases IL-10, Foxp3, and CD4\u002BCD25\u002B regulatory T cells in CLN. This study also suggests that intranasal administration of IL-35 can attenuate allergic rhinitis.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Motohiko; Yokota, Makoto; Nakamura, Yoshihisa; Ozaki, Shinya; Murakami, Shingo","journal":"Allergology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f292b626af0f6632fc307e56a378ccc52eabd8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130026.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1323893016301332; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1323893016301332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alit.2016.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27707583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of IL","effect of IL","increases IL","intranasal administration of IL","Abstract Background IL","Nasal symptoms","level of OVA","nasal allergic responses","OVA-specific IgE","Nasal tissue","nasal mucosa","OVA antigen","intranasal challenge of OVA","OVA-specific T cell response","OVA-specific T cell proliferation","regulatory T cells","symptoms of allergic rhinitis","Intranasal administration of rIL","recombinant fusion protein of murine IL","Results rIL","CD25","mice","nasal rubbing movements","transcription level of Foxp3","frequency of CD4","production of cytokines","CLN","study","number of sneezes","number of eosinophils","Th2 cytokines","sera","human IgG1 Fc fragment","cervical lymph nodes","ovalbumin","time","anti-inflammatory cytokine","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the study was to examine the travel patterns of professionals visiting Swedish farms (veterinarians, milk tanker drivers, artificial inseminators, maintenance technicians and livestock hauliers). This was done by obtaining records of the farms visited by a sample of professionals in the above categories in one week in January, one week in April, one week in July and one week in October in the Swedish counties V\u00E4sterbotten, S\u00F6dermanland, V\u00E4sterg\u00F6tland and Sk\u00E5ne. RESULTS: There were twelve participating organisations, and data was provided for one to three individuals/vehicles/veterinary practices per professional category and per geographic region (except for dairy service technicians and livestock hauliers who did not provide data from all regions). There was a trend towards larger areas covered and smaller number of farms visited per week in the north, but exceptions occurred and there were regional variations. Generally, the greatest areas were travelled by milk tankers and livestock hauliers, and the profession travelling over the smallest areas tended to be the veterinarians. Milk tankers visited most farms per week, one milk tanker could visit between 23 and 90 farms per week and travel over areas between 717 km(2) and 23,512 km(2) per week. CONCLUSIONS: Valuable insight into the travel patterns of Swedish professionals has emerged although the implications of the study largely concern highly infectious diseases. Movement of live animals pose the greatest risk for the spread of infectious animal diseases; however indirect contacts are important for many diseases. The results of this study indicate that in Sweden a highly contagious disease might spread over a large area in the time span of one incubation period, which ought to be kept in mind in case of an outbreak and in outbreak investigations. The difficulties in contacting some professionals visiting farms could be a problem in an outbreak situation.","publish_time":"2014-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olofsson, Emelie; N\u00F6remark, Maria; Lewerin, Susanna Sternberg","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4222379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366065/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-014-0070-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["week","Swedish farms","Infectious diseases of livestock","livestock hauliers","spread of infectious animal diseases","smaller number of farms","travel patterns of Swedish professionals","travel patterns of professionals","milk tankers","greatest areas","study","animal production","animal health","larger areas","sample of professionals","smallest areas","milk tanker drivers","live animal movements","indirect contacts","veterinarians","outbreak situation","outbreak investigations","data","RESULTS","Swedish counties V\u00E4sterbotten","maintenance technicians","greatest risk","transport vehicles","dairy service technicians","Movement of live animals","artificial inseminators","geographic region","professional category","negative consequences","veterinary practices","time span","people","S\u00F6dermanland","V\u00E4sterg\u00F6tland","large area","Valuable insight","fomites","exceptions","problem","contagious disease","physical vectors","incubation period","Sk\u00E5ne","individuals","Sweden","CONCLUSIONS","participating organisations","trend","case","welfare","categories","implications","north","BACKGROUND","regional variations","mind","difficulties","regions","objective","records"],"language":"en"},

Both genosensors rely on the hybridization of the oligonucleotide target with its complementary probe, which is immobilized on positively charged polylysine modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs), through electrostatic interactions. In one design, a biotinylated target is used and the detection of the hybridization reaction is monitored using alkaline phosphatase labeled streptavidin (S-AP). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) to indigo, which is then solubilized to indigo carmine and detected by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). In the other design, the target is labeled using an Au(I) complex, sodium aurothiomalate, and the duplex formation is detected by measuring, for first time, the current generated by the hydrogen evolution catalyzed by the gold label. Using 30 min of hybridization time, a detection limit of 8 pM is calculated for the enzymatic genosensor. Although this good sensitivity cannot be reached with the metal label (0.5 nM), the use of this label allows a considerable decrease of the analysis time. Both genosensors do not require the modification of the oligonucleotide probe and using stringent experimental conditions (60 min of hybridization time and 50% formamide in the hybridization buffer) can discriminate between a complementary oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide with a three-base mismatch.","publish_time":"2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDaz-Gonz\u00E1lez, Mar\u00EDa; de la Escosura-Mu\u00F1iz, Alfredo; Gonz\u00E1lez-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Bego\u00F1a; Costa-Garc\u00EDa, Agust\u00EDn","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127112.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566307004915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18207382/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566307004915; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2007.12.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hybridization time","hybridization reaction","oligonucleotide target","hybridization buffer","oligonucleotide probe","complementary oligonucleotide","genosensors","analysis time","electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensors","detection limit","complementary probe","biotinylated target","metal label","gold label","design","indigo carmine","severe acute respiratory syndrome","mer sequence unique","SPCEs","alkaline phosphatase","virus","SARS","hydrogen evolution","stringent experimental conditions","sodium aurothiomalate","considerable decrease","screen-printed carbon electrodes","substrate","duplex formation","polylysine","streptavidin","formamide","indoxyl phosphate","S-AP","hydrolysis","complex","IP","nM","use","measuring","modification","cyclic voltammetry","electrostatic interactions","CV","enzymatic genosensor","enzyme","base mismatch","good sensitivity","work"],"language":"en"},

Of 1105 stool samples available, viral RNA/DNA was detected in 247 (26.2%) of 941 pediatric samples (median age = 2.97 years, 54% male) with 28 (3.0%) positive for more than one virus.

Herbal medicine, used for thousands of years in combinational therapies (Herb Formula), plays a significant role in stimulating the host immune system in vivo, and meanwhile, in fighting against the pandemic by directly inhibiting influenza virus in vitro. Such potential Janus functions may spark interest in therapeutic manipulation of virus diseases. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of the Janus functions of the medicinal herbs in the treatment of influenza remains unclear. In this work, to illustrate the therapeutic concept of Janus functions in the treatment of influenza, we have introduced a novel systems pharmacology model that integrates pharmacokinetic screening, targeting and network analysis of two representative herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae that are efficient in the treatment of influenza, inflammation and other diseases. 50 Chemicals with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles have been identified for the two herbs, and the ligand\u2013target network was constructed by complementing the literature-based experimental data deposited in DrugBank. The annotation of these chemicals was assigned using a novel drug targeting approach, and mapped to target\u2013disease and drug\u2013target\u2013pathway networks. The overall data suggest that the medicinal herbs function by indirectly suppressing the virus proliferation via regulating the immune systems in hosts, and also, by directly inhibiting virus proliferation through targeting viral proteins essential for the viral life cycle. For the first time, we have demonstrated the mechanism of medicinal herbs in prevention and treatment of virus diseases via the Janus functions on a systematic level.","publish_time":"2012-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xia; Xu, Xue; Li, Yan; Li, Xiuxiu; Tao, Weiyang; Li, Bohui; Wang, Yonghua; Yang, Ling","journal":"Integr Biol (Camb)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7269b61f6452772b2222cf80e492d093e0e75bc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108588.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c2ib20204b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23168537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Herb Formula"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of influenza","influenza disease","treatment of virus diseases","virus proliferation","mechanism of medicinal herbs","medicinal herbs function","potential Janus functions","therapeutic manipulation of virus diseases","therapeutic concept of Janus functions","continuing emergence of new drug-resistant influenza virus strains","imminent threat of influenza pandemics","target network","novel drug targeting approach","representative herbs Lonicera japonica","novel strategies","immune systems","Chemicals","novel systems pharmacology model","pharmacokinetic screening","network analysis","experimental data","overall data","molecular mechanism","viral proteins essential","viral life cycle","favorable pharmacokinetic profiles","host immune system","Fructus Forsythiae","prevention","thousands of years","Herb Formula","combinational therapies","significant role","pathway networks","literature","systematic level","ligand","inflammation","Herbal medicine","DrugBank","hosts","fighting","annotation","time"],"language":"en"},

Here, this system was compared with an autotransporter protein surface display system. The TGEV C and A epitopes were fused to the passenger domain of the MisL autotransporter of Salmonella. Expression of both the MisL- and 987P subunit FasA-fusions to the TGEV epitopes were under the control of in vivo-induced promoters. Expression of the TGEV epitopes from the Salmonella typhimurium CS4552 (crp cya asd pgtE) vaccine strain was greater when the epitopes were fused to MisL than when they were fused to the 987P FasA subunit. However, when BALB/c mice were orally immunized with the Salmonella vector expressing the TGEV epitopes from either one of the fusion constructs or both together, the highest level of anti-TGEV antibody was obtained with the 987P-TGEV immunogen-displaying vector.

Both angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and insulin/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) show cardioprotective effects after acute MI. The Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism is associated with diminished activity of insulin. In the present study, we explored the association among Arg(972) IRS-1, acute MI, and serum levels of ACE2. METHODS: A total of 711 subjects, including 351 subjects with first-time acute MI and 360 subjects without a history of MI were genotyped for Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism. Serum levels of ACE2 and MI severity scores were determined. Primary human cardiomyocytes with overexpression of wild type IRS-1 or Arg(972) IRS-1 or knockdown of endogenous IRS-1 were exposed to normoxia and hypoxia, and the expression levels of ACE2 were determined. RESULTS: The serum ACE2 level was significantly increased in acute MI patients compared with that of non-MI controls. Compared with wild type IRS-1 carriers, Arg(972) IRS-1 carriers exhibited decreased serum ACE2 levels and increased MI severity scores after MI. Our in vitro data demonstrate that impairment of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling by overexpression of Arg(972)-IRS-1, knockdown of endogenous IRS-1, or PI3K inhibitor can abolish hypoxia-induced IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and ACE2 expression in human cardiomyocytes, which suggests a causal relationship between Arg(972)-IRS-1 and decreased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. Our in vitro data also indicate that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can enhance the induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of crosstalk between insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and RAS after acute MI, thereby adding fresh insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of acute MI.","publish_time":"2013-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wei; Zhou, Xinmin; Yu, Fenglei; Hu, Jianguo; Hu, Wen","journal":"Cardiovasc Diabetol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84aa85f8690419badcdb6d6777763e6fc3235af1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4015180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24134599/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2840-12-151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRS","RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","hypoxia-induced IRS","knockdown of endogenous IRS","serum levels of ACE2","expression levels of ACE2","acute MI patients","first-time acute MI","overexpression of wild type IRS","decreased serum ACE2 levels","history of MI","overexpression of Arg","increased MI severity scores","non-MI controls","treatment of acute","impairment of insulin","PI3K inhibitor","associated PI3K activity","diminished activity of insulin","subjects","insulin receptor substrate","induction effect of insulin","Primary human cardiomyocytes","carriers","RAS","data","polymorphism","present study","pathophysiology of myocardial infarction","renin-angiotensin system","critical role","fresh insights","Activation","association","evidence of crosstalk","cardioprotective effects","causal relationship","development of heart failure","RESULTS","enzyme","normoxia","BACKGROUND","METHODS","total","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Glycoprotein (G-protein) cDNA from RABV challenge virus standard-11 (CVS-11) and EBLV-1 and -2 were cloned and co-expressed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag\u2013pol and packageable green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter genes in human cells. The harvested lentiviral (HIV) vector infected over 40 % of baby hamster kidney (BHK) target cells, providing high-titre pseudotype stocks. Tests on blinded antibody-positive (n=15) and -negative (n=45) sera, predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Office International des Epizooties (OIE), revealed that the CVS-11 pseudotype assay had 100 % concordance with FAVN and strongly correlated with neutralization titres (r(2)=0.89). Cross-neutralization tests using sera from RABV-vaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with CVS-11, EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 envelopes showed that the relative neutralization titres correlated broadly with the degree of G-protein diversity. Pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests: (i) they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories; (ii) the use of reporter genes such as GFP or \u03B2-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide; (iii) each assay requires \u003C10 \u03BCl serum. This robust microassay will improve our understanding of the protective humoral immunity that current rabies vaccines confer against emerging lyssaviruses, and will be applicable to surveillance studies, thus helping to control the spread of rabies.","publish_time":"2008-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wright, Edward; Temperton, Nigel J.; Marston, Denise A.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Fooks, Anthony R.; Weiss, Robin A.","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0eabdda18ddcbe7d2c1ed0932ee123d7eb6dbbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2886951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.2008/000349-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycoprotein"],"organizations":["RABV","World Health Organization","Office International des Epizooties","FAVN","GFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rabies virus","fluorescent antibody virus neutralization","live-virus neutralization tests","EBLV","Cross-neutralization tests","human immunodeficiency virus","relative neutralization titres","CVS","RABV challenge virus standard","murine leukemia virus","G-protein","lentiviral pseudotypes","pseudotype assay","GFP","sera","FAVN","protein diversity","human cells","HIV","spread of rabies","packageable green fluorescent protein","RABV-vaccinated humans","current rabies vaccines","luciferase reporter genes","use of reporter genes","target cells","emerging lyssaviruses","degree of G","level laboratories","low-biohazard","low cost","European bat lyssaviruses","blinded antibody-positive","high-titre pseudotype stocks","gag","pol","cDNA","BHK","protective humoral immunity","MLV","major advantages","understanding","baby hamster kidney","animals","Office International","World Health Organization","OIE","\u03B2-galactosidase","envelopes","Epizooties","antigen vectors","Glycoprotein","concordance","surveillance studies","robust microassay","\u03BCl serum"],"language":"en"},

The virion particle is composed of seven proteins organized in three concentric layers, an outer layer made of VP2 and VP5, a middle layer made of VP7, and inner layer made of VP3 that encloses a replicase complex of VP1, VP4, and VP6 and a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments. In this study, we sought to develop highly efficacious candidate vaccines against all AHSV serotypes, taking into account not only immunogenic and safety properties but also virus productivity and stability parameters, which are essential criteria for vaccine candidates. To achieve this goal, we first established a highly efficient reverse genetics (RG) system for AHSV serotype 1 (AHSV1) and, subsequently, a VP6-defective AHSV1 strain in combination with in trans complementation of VP6. This was then used to generate defective particles of all nine serotypes, which required the exchange of two to five RNA segments to achieve equivalent titers of particles. All reassortant-defective viruses could be amplified and propagated to high titers in cells complemented with VP6 but were totally incompetent in any other cells. Furthermore, these replication-incompetent AHSV particles were demonstrated to be highly protective against homologous virulent virus challenges in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice. Thus, these defective viruses have the potential to be used for the development of safe and stable vaccine candidates. The RG system also provides a powerful tool for the study of the role of individual AHSV proteins in virus assembly, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE African horse sickness virus is transmitted by biting midges and causes African horse sickness in equids, with mortality reaching up to 95% in naive horses. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines is extremely important due to major economic losses in the equine industry. Through the establishment of a highly efficient RG system, replication-deficient viruses of all nine AHSV serotypes were generated. These defective viruses achieved high titers in a cell line complemented with VP6 but failed to propagate in wild-type mammalian or insect cells. Importantly, these candidate vaccine strains showed strong protective efficacy against AHSV infection in an IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mouse model.","publish_time":"2016-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lulla, Valeria; Lulla, Aleksei; Wernike, Kerstin; Aebischer, Andrea; Beer, Martin; Roy, Polly","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d32215c90a79509e66eb1f6e3e05b077d08ee1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4984648.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00548-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHSV","RG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AHSV serotypes","AHSV infection","defective particles","replication-incompetent AHSV particles","reassortant-defective viruses","VP6-defective AHSV1 strain","virus assembly","virus productivity","IMPORTANCE African horse sickness virus","efficient RG system","role of individual AHSV proteins","different serotypes","high titers","replication-deficient viruses","development of efficient vaccines","trans complementation of VP6","equivalent titers of particles","homologous virulent virus challenges","outer layer","IFNAR","candidate vaccine strains","middle layer","inner layer","stable vaccine candidates","equids","insect cells","study","efficient reverse genetics","efficacious candidate vaccines","double-stranded RNA segments","development of safe","strong protective efficacy","wild-type mammalian","interferon receptor","combination","biting midges","safety properties","stability parameters","major economic losses","VP4","essential criteria","VP2","VP5","genome","account","morphogenesis","powerful tool","cell line","equine industry","replicase complex of VP1","VP3","Reoviridae family","concentric layers","devastating disease","VP7","orbivirus","knockout mice","pathogenesis","exchange","mortality","establishment","potential","virion particle","mouse model","naive horses","goal"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by stratifying the comorbidity status. METHODS: We analysed the data from 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised patients 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between December 11(th), 2019 and January 31(st), 2020. We analyse the composite endpoints, which consisted of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD [hazards ratio (HR) 2.681, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.424\u20135.048], diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03\u20132.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07\u20132.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60\u20137.64) were risk factors of reaching to the composite endpoints.

CONCLUSION: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Wei-jie; Liang, Wen-hua; Zhao, Yi; Liang, Heng-rui; Chen, Zi-sheng; Li, Yi-min; Liu, Xiao-qing; Chen, Ru-chong; Tang, Chun-li; Wang, Tao; Ou, Chun-quan; Li, Li; Chen, Ping-yan; Sang, Ling; Wang, Wei; Li, Jian-fu; Li, Cai-chen; Ou, Li-min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Ni, Zheng-yi; Xiang, Jie; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-liang; Peng, Yi-xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-ming; Liu, Ji-yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-jian; Qiu, Shao-qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-jiang; Zhu, Shao-yong; Cheng, Lin-ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-yue; Zheng, Jin-ping; Zhang, Nuo-fu; Zhong, Nan-shan; He, Jian-xing","journal":"Eur Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44cdbd8678bbc7b1a5af0aa154c152cbf9f0e10e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7098485.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00547-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HR","hospitalised patients","composite endpoints","comorbidity status","prevalent comorbidity","cases of Covid","poorer clinical outcomes","greater number of comorbidities","coronavirus disease","risk of serious adverse outcomes","laboratory","risk factors","hypertension","diabetes","smoking status","mean age","Severe cases","province","autonomous regions","provincial municipalities","hospitals","COPD","mainland China","hazards ratio","invasive ventilation","intensive care unit","admission","confidence interval","data","presence","malignancy","death","RESULTS","years","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","study population","METHODS","outbreak","OBJECTIVE","females"],"language":"en"},

Social media creates public streams of communication, and scientists are starting to understand that such data can provide some level of access into the people\u0027s opinions and situations. As such, this paper aims to review and synthesize the literature on Twitter applications for public health, highlighting current research and products in practice. A scoping review methodology was employed and four leading health, computer science and cross-disciplinary databases were searched. A total of 755 articles were retreived, 92 of which met the criteria for review. From the reviewed literature, six domains for the application of Twitter to public health were identified: (i) Surveillance; (ii) Event Detection; (iii) Pharmacovigilance; (iv) Forecasting; (v) Disease Tracking; and (vi) Geographic Identification. From our review, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the use of Twitter for public health. We gained insights into interesting observations such as how the popularity of different domains changed with time, the diseases and conditions studied and the different approaches to understanding each disease, which algorithms and techniques were popular with each domain, and more.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edo-Osagie, Oduwa; De La Iglesia, Beatriz; Lake, Iain; Edeghere, Obaghe","journal":"Computers in biology and medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/415d62019921a186943fac8ec56d7a0e91a7654d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482520301426?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482520301426; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health purposes","leading health","Abstract Public health practitioners","public streams of communication","use of Twitter","social media data","Twitter applications","application of Twitter","popularity of different domains","different approaches","scoping review methodology","long time","Disease Tracking","reviewed literature","traditional medical databases","cross-disciplinary databases","researchers","computer science","current research","study","level of access","impact","history","people\u0027s opinions","techniques","products","conditions","clear picture","diseases","internet","large technological development","Event Detection","Pharmacovigilance","interesting observations","situations","practice","Forecasting","algorithms","scientists","advent","behaviour of society","Surveillance","insights","Geographic Identification","total","articles","criteria","paper"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of MERS survivors who required hospitalization in Saudi Arabia during 2016\u20132017, approximately 1 year after diagnosis. The Short-Form General Health Survey 36 (SF-36) was administered by telephone interview to assess 8 quality of life domains for MERS survivors and a sample of survivors of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) without MERS. We compared mean SF-36 scores of MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors using independent t-test, and compared categorical variables using chi-square test. Adjusted analyses were performed using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Of 355 MERS survivors, 83 were eligible and 78 agreed to participate. MERS survivors were younger than non-MERS SARI survivors (mean \u00B1 SD): (44.9 years \u00B112.9) vs (50.0 years \u00B113.6), p = 0.031. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were similar for MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors (46.2% vs. 57.1%), p = 0.20. After adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences between MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors in physical component or mental component summary scores. MERS ICU survivors scored lower than MERS survivors not admitted to an ICU for physical function (p = 0.05), general health (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.03), emotional role (p = 0.03) and physical component summary (p \u003C 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Functional scores were similar for MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors. However, MERS survivors of critical illness reported lower quality of life than survivors of less severe illness.

To develop standard WNV diagnostic tools that can differentiate WNV from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to WNV envelope (E) protein were produced and characterized by isotyping, reactivity with denatured and native antigens, affinity assay, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and epitope competition, as well as cross-reactivity with JEV. Two of the MAbs (6A11 and 4B3) showed stronger reactivity with E protein than the others (2F5 and 6H7) in Western blot analysis. 4B3 could bind with denatured antigen, as well as native antigens in indirect ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, and IFA; whereas 2F5 showed highest affinity with native antigen. 4B3 and 2F5 were therefore used to establish an antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) detection system. The sensitivity of this AC-ELISA was 3.95 TCID50/0.1ml for WNV-infected cell culture supernatant. Notably, these MAbs showed no cross-reactivity with JEV, which suggests that they are useful for further development of highly sensitive, easy handling, and less time-consuming detection kits/tools in WNV surveillance in areas where JEV is epidemic.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, June; Liu, Bohua; Cao, Zhen; Inoue, Shingo; Morita, Kouichi; Tian, Kegong; Zhu, Qingyu; Gao, George F.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dcf15b7349e6e2e3c3aeec4506e0dc5dd48a327.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948139/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408003327; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408003327; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.09.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","JEV"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["JEV","WNV surveillance","WNV envelope","AC-ELISA","2F5","cross-reactivity","MAbs","4B3","antigen capture-ELISA","native antigens","standard WNV diagnostic tools","indirect ELISA","denatured antigen","stronger reactivity","affinity assay","IFA","WNV-infected cell culture supernatant","E protein","immunofluorescence assay","highest affinity","detection system","time-consuming detection kits","flow cytometry analysis","Japanese encephalitis virus","Western blot analysis","Abstract Recent epidemics of West Nile virus","easy handling","monoclonal antibodies","areas","significant rates of mortality","morbidity","development","6H7","world","6A11","isotyping","epitope competition","humans","TCID50","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Towards this effort, the current review outlines the key aspects of the pathobiology associated with the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, which includes a viral response phase and an exaggerated host response phase. The review also summarizes therapeutic agents that are currently being explored along with those with potential for consideration. The broad groups of therapeutic agents discussed include those that: (i) block viral entry to host cells, (ii) block viral replication and survival in host cells, and (iii) dampen exaggerated host immune response.

A survey was conducted during 2002\u20132004 as a follow-up to a previous study in 2001 of the cat colony to identify pathogens circulating among the population and to annually follow the status of the cats to analyze morbidity coefficients and associations among infections and infestations identified in the colony. During the 3 years of the present study, 75 cats were sampled at least once, including 44 that were caught and examined only once, 14 that were examined twice, and 17 that were examined three times. For each cat that was caught, records were kept regarding sex, age, general health, and the presence of ectoparasites. Each year, a blood sample was taken for hematologic testing, platelet count, hemoparasite detection, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and retrovirus detection. Blood counts were within normal range for the majority of cats tested. Feline immunodeficiency virus, fleas, and lice were detected in all years; however, incidence rates for each of these varied significantly throughout the years. Prevalence of Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma spp., T. gondii infections were variable among the 3 years, although differences were not significant. Prevalence of feline leukemia virus increased significantly over the 3 years. Mycoplasma spp. and flea infestations were significantly associated, but no other associations among the pathogens were detected. Over the 3 years, the rate of new cat introductions decreased, and the pathogens showed a tendency to disseminate throughout the colony; however, there was virtually no evidence of clinically detectable disease. Therefore, it seems that stabilizing the population by a judicious control program facilitated the distribution of the pathogens throughout the colony, while the general well-being of the cats was not seriously affected.","publish_time":"2007-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendes-de-Almeida, Flavya; Labarthe, Norma; Guerrero, Jorge; Faria, Maria Carolina Ferreira; Branco, Aline Serricella; Pereira, C\u00E1ssia Dias; Barreira, Jairo Dias; Pereira, Maria Julia Salim","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99db89db377fb77540a5123e01f16450d28a0f65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130795.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401707001847; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401707001847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["years","cat colony","pathogens","colony of feral","majority of cats","semi-feral domestic cats","gondii infections","Mycoplasma","associations","population","Prevalence of feline leukemia virus","Feline immunodeficiency virus","hemoparasite detection","Toxoplasma gondii","retrovirus detection","general health","blood sample","rate of new cat introductions","Blood counts","general well-being","previous study","present study","flea infestations","Prevalence of Cytauxzoon","antibodies","hematologic testing","shelter","platelet count","urban areas","food","zoological garden of Rio","normal range","distribution","morbidity coefficients","judicious control program","sex","age","fleas","Janeiro","lice","records","incidence rates","status","variable","presence of ectoparasites","evidence","detectable disease","follow-up","differences","tendency","survey","times"],"language":"en"},

Previous work showed that PDCoV infection inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production. To further identify and characterize the PDCoV-encoded IFN antagonists will broaden our understanding of its pathogenesis. Nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) encodes an endoribonuclease that is highly conserved among vertebrate nidoviruses (coronaviruses and arteriviruses) and plays a critical role in viral replication and transcription. Here, we found that PDCoV nsp15 significantly inhibits Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN-\u03B2 production. PDCoV nsp15 disrupts the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03BAB p65 subunit, but not antagonizes the activation of transcription factor IRF3. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis found that PDCoV nsp15 mutants (H129A, H234A, K269A) lacking endoribonuclease activity also suppress SEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 production and NF-\u03BAB activation, suggesting that the endoribonuclease activity is not required for its ability to antagonize IFN-\u03B2 production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV nsp15 is an IFN antagonist and it inhibits interferon-\u03B2 production via an endoribonuclease activity-independent mechanism.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiaorong; Fang, Puxian; Fang, Liurong; Hong, Yingying; Zhu, Xinyu; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bbcdc1db7feeedcd55ba7f4e429f2c8358b4221.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112593.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019302901; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019302901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV nsp15 mutants","PDCoV infection","SEV-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","PDCoV-encoded IFN antagonists","interferon-\u03B2 production","endoribonuclease activity-independent mechanism","NF-\u03BAB activation","activation of transcription factor IRF3","nuclear translocation of NF","\u03BAB p65 subunit","diarrhea","H234A","intestinal damage","emerging swine coronavirus","type","Sendai virus","arteriviruses","critical role","K269A","H129A","phosphorylation","vertebrate nidoviruses","coronaviruses","nursing piglets","viral replication","understanding","mutagenesis","ability","Previous work","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","Nonstructural protein","site","results","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. METHODS: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. RESULTS: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria. Necropsies supplemented with microbiology were the most efficient diagnostic methods in characterizing the studied outbreaks.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haimi-Hakala, Minna; H\u00E4lli, Outi; Laurila, Tapio; Raunio-Saarnisto, Mirja; Nokireki, Tiina; Laine, Taina; Nyk\u00E4senoja, Suvi; Pelkola, Kirsti; Segales, Joaquim; Sibila, Marina; Oliviero, Claudio; Peltoniemi, Olli; Pelkonen, Sinikka; Heinonen, Mari","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76d446112561ab0100feb5323f071191e0aa02c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5568250.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-017-0065-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852568/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ascaris"],"organizations":["APP","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory outbreaks","respiratory infections","case herds","study","respiratory problems","acute outbreaks of respiratory disease","control herds","certain herds","acute respiratory symptoms","porcine respiratory coronavirus","main causes of respiratory outbreaks","lung samples","respiratory syndrome virus","acute APP infection diagnosis","PCV2","studied outbreaks","antimicrobial resistance profile","antimicrobial resistance determination","paired serum samples","nasal swab samples","finishing pigs","clinical signs","concurrent infections","clinical use of various methods","bacteriology","Pathology","field necropsies","Serology","PCR","efficient diagnostic methods","possible subclinical infections","certain opportunistic bacteria","Ascaris suum","inconclusive results","presence of porcine circovirus type","field conditions","swine influenza virus","main bacterial pathogen","PRRSV","PRCV","common cause","florfenicol","penicillin","Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies","enrofloxacin","tulathromycin","trimethoprim","sulfamethoxazole","ampicillin","microbiology","viral pathogens","total","Finland","tiamulin","Polymerase chain reaction","addition","bleeding","tetracycline","BACKGROUND","objective","miscellaneous etiology","CONCLUSIONS","Researchers","visit"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases.

In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results. Herein, we report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain. Non-meteorological factors such as population density, population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been considered for the analysis. No evidence suggesting a reduction in COVID-19 cases at warmer mean, minimum and maximum temperatures has been found.

SARS-CoV viraemia does not seem to reach high titres, however, it has to be excluded that virus transmission may occur via blood transfusion or application of therapeutic plasma products, e.g. fresh-frozen plasma or single components derived thereof. Manufacturing processes of all plasma derivatives are required to comprise dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps. Treatment with a mixture of solvent and detergent (SD) has successfully been applied to inactivate the most members of the transfusion-relevant viruses without affecting therapeutic properties of the products. The SD treatment irreversibly disrupts the lipid envelope of viruses such as HIV, HBV, HCV, HGV and CMV. In this study we evaluated the manufacturing process of an immunoglobulin preparation (OCTAGAM, manufactured by Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H., Vienna, Austria) for its capacity to inactivate the SARS-CoV.

The emergence of new IB virus (IBV) variants might lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure. Information about circulating IBV in a region is important to decide which IB vaccine should be used. However, information about recent IBV strains which circulated in Indonesia and their genetic characters were limited; therefore, the aim of our research was to determine the genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV isolated from commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 viral isolate samples collected from chickens with clinical sign and reduced in egg production. Six IB live vaccines were used as control, the reference vaccines represent IBV strains including H120, H52, 4/91, CR88, 233A, and 1-96. Primers XCe2\u002B and XCe2- were used to amplify S1 gene partially. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 47 samples showed positive result to S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Three IBV isolates, Indonesia/K233A31/18, Indonesia/K4A9/17, and Indonesia/P3/17, were selected for nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 352 nucleotides of the partial S1 gene shows that isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91, while isolate Indonesia/P3/17 has 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 233A. CONCLUSION: Our result indicates that at least two IBV strains were circulating among poultry in West Java, Indonesia, which is IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91 and 233A. The present study provides updates on the circulating IBV in commercial poultry flocks in West Java, Indonesia, and might use as guidance on selecting a proper IB vaccine strain to improve IB vaccination efficacy in certain region.","publish_time":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setiawaty, Rahajeng; Soejoedono, Retno Damajanti; Poetri, Okti Nadia","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/403be352ce64603bdb313a00238d5b77b7305321.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6460881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040563/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.231-235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IB"],"locations":["West Java","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["IBV vaccine strain","circulating IBV","IBV isolates","IBV close","isolates Indonesia","recent IBV strains","proper IB vaccine strain","vaccine virus strain","genetic characterization of S1 gene of IBV","IB outbreaks","IB vaccination efficacy","IB live vaccines","commercial poultry flocks","partial S1 gene","emergence of new IB virus","West Java","poultry industry","vaccinated flocks","K233A31","K4A9","homology","AIM","Information","P3","viral isolate samples","reference vaccines","positive result","certain region","genetic characters","Primers XCe2","reason of vaccination failure","H120","control","variants","clinical sign","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","total","chickens","nucleotides","updates","major problem","mismatching","Infectious bronchitis","H52","guidance","present study","METHODS","egg production","BACKGROUND","research","Phylogenetic analysis","MATERIALS","CR88","nucleotide sequencing","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Animal-to-human transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.

Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range. Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach. A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation. The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomeni, Roberto; Xu, Tianhong; Gao, Xuejuan; Bressolle-Gomeni, Fran\u00E7oise","journal":"Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435882/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-020-09690-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human SARS-CoV","treatment of SARS","SR formulation","IR formulation","times","PK of indomethacin","Different dosage regimens","promising candidate","benefits of alternative dosage regimens","potential effective treatments","expected antiviral activity","CCoV-infected dogs","multi-stage model-based approach","effective exposure","best performing dosing regimens","canine CCoV","function of different assumptions","vitro antiviral properties","potential therapeutic effect","published data","viral load","pandemic various attempts","administration of immediate","days","available drugs","criteria","patients","low micromolar range","recovery","complete response","formulations","release","anti-inflammatory drug","prospective clinical trial","dose","coronavirus","results","objective"],"language":"en"},

Although PEDV vaccines have been used widely, the disease has swept rapidly across the county, and is commonly observed in PED-vaccinated farms, and has recurred in domestic herds. To better understand PEDVs responsible for the reemerging outbreaks in Japan, full-length spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of 45 PEDVs collected in Japan during 2013\u20132016, were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis based on S gene sequences revealed that all the recent field PEDVs were genetically distinct from the classical Japanese strains, and were classified into three genotypes: North American (NA), S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Our data suggested a possibility that multiple parental PEDV strains were introduced into Japan from abroad at the same time or similar times. The newly identified Japanese strains showed the closest relationship to the US strains. Two sublineages of Japanese strains circulating in Japan were similar to two sublineages identified in the US, suggesting common ancestors for these strains. In comparison with two vaccine strains used in Japan, the field strains had various changes in epitope regions, glycosylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. These substitutions, particularly observed in epitope regions of the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins, may have affected antigenicity and vaccine efficacy, resulting in an unsuccessful PEDV control. Sequence comparisons between PEDVs collected from primary and secondary outbreaks in three herds revealed that the disease has developed to an endemic stage in which PEDV could persist for nearly two years in the herds or local regions, causing subsequent epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the genetic characteristics, origin, and molecular epidemiology of PEDVs circulating in Japan, as well as the PEDV strains causing recurrent outbreaks. This study provides a better insight into the PEDVs responsible for recent outbreaks in Japan, and could potentially help to develop measures for controlling and preventing the disease.

METHODS: A consensus conference on the spectrum of lung\u2013kidney interactions in critical illness was held under the auspices of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in Innsbruck, Austria, in June 2018. Through review and critical appraisal of the available evidence, the current state of research, and both clinical and research recommendations were described on the following topics: epidemiology, pathophysiology and strategies to mitigate pulmonary dysfunction among patients with acute kidney injury and/or kidney dysfunction among patients with acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, emphasis was put on patients receiving organ support (RRT, IMV and/or ECMO) and its impact on lung and kidney function. CONCLUSION: The ADQI 21 conference found significant knowledge gaps about organ crosstalk between lung and kidney and its relevance for critically ill patients. Lung protective ventilation, conservative fluid management and early recognition and treatment of pulmonary infections were the only clinical recommendations with higher quality of evidence. Recommendations for research were formulated, targeting lung\u2013kidney interactions to improve care processes and outcomes in critical illness.

TRPV6 mutations have recently been associated with an antenatally severe under-mineralising skeletal dysplasia accompanied by postnatal biochemical abnormalities. This is the first post-mortem report in a patient with TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia. CASE PRESENTATION: The female infant had severe antenatal and postnatal skeletal abnormalities by 20 weeks gestation and was ventilator-dependent from birth. These skeletal abnormalities were apparent at an earlier gestational age than in previous reported cases and a more severe clinical course ensued. Biochemical and skeletal abnormalities, including bone density, improved postnatally but cardiac arrest at 4 months of age led to withdrawal of intensive care. Compound heterozygous TRPV6 variants (c.1978G \u003E C p.(Gly660Arg) and c.1528C \u003E T p.(Arg510Ter)) were identified on exome sequencing. Post-mortem identified skeletal abnormalities but no specific abnormalities in other organ systems. No placental pathology was found, multi-organ histological features reflected prolonged intensive care only. Post-mortem macroscopic examination indicated reduced thoracic size and short, pale and pliable ribs. Histological examination identified reduced number of trabeculae in the diaphyses (away from the growth plates), whereas metaphyses showed adequate mineralisation and normal number of trabeculae, but with slightly enlarged reactive chondrocytes, indicating post-natal skeletal growth recovery. Post-mortem radiological findings demonstrated improved bone density, improved rib width, healed fractures, although ribs were still shorter than normal. Long bones (especially humerus and femur) had improved from initial poorly defined metaphyses and reduced bone density to sharply defined metaphyses, prominent growth restart lines in distal diaphyses and bone-in-bone appearance along diaphyses. CONCLUSIONS: This case provide bone histological confirmation that human skeletal development is compromised in the presence of TRPV6 pathogenic variants. Post-mortem findings were consistent with abnormal in utero skeletal mineralisation due to severe calcium deficit from compromised placental calcium transfer, followed by subsequent phenotypic improvement with adequate postnatal calcium availability. Significant skeletal recovery occurs in the early weeks of postnatal life in TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mason, Anna E.; Grier, David; Smithson, Sarah F.; Burren, Christine P.; Gradhand, Elise","journal":"BMC Med Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84453636802f337d2b04e42031702855cc20d573.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["postnatal skeletal abnormalities","TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia","utero skeletal mineralisation","Significant skeletal recovery","improved bone density","human skeletal development","reduced bone density","postnatal biochemical abnormalities","post-natal skeletal growth recovery","calcium-selective channel TRPV6","bone appearance","antenatally severe under-mineralising skeletal dysplasia","specific abnormalities","Post-mortem findings","TRPV6 mutations","severe calcium deficit","bone histological confirmation","adequate postnatal calcium availability","post-mortem report","Post-mortem macroscopic examination","Post-mortem radiological findings","defined metaphyses","compromised placental calcium transfer","Histological examination","presence of TRPV6 pathogenic variants","Compound heterozygous TRPV6 variants","reduced number of trabeculae","early weeks of postnatal life","maternal-fetal calcium transport","adequate mineralisation","severe clinical course","improved rib width","distal diaphyses","growth plates","normal number of trabeculae","multi-organ histological features","reduced thoracic size","prolonged intensive care","withdrawal of intensive care","prominent growth restart lines","weeks gestation","months of age","organ systems","placental pathology","pliable ribs","CASE PRESENTATION","earlier gestational age","transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member","subsequent phenotypic improvement","previous reported cases","female infant","healed fractures","reactive chondrocytes","patient","cardiac arrest","femur","ventilator-dependent","Long bones","humerus","Arg510Ter","Gly660Arg","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","birth","exome sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Disease can result in poor feed conversion, reduced weight gain, and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis. For prevention of coccidiosis, poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live, sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery. Traditionally, coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent, however, new technology using gel diluents has entered the US market. Gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are \u201Cdropped\u201D onto chicks with an applicator bar. It is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets, allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts. In this experiment, the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent, a more viscous gel diluent, and a less viscous gel diluent was compared. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding. Shedding in the first cycle (days 5 to 8 post-vaccination) was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method, where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts. However, a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle (days 12 to 15 post-vaccination). Chickens were challenged with Eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications. All vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring. The results of this project indicate that all vaccine applications are effective at protecting against Eimeria maxima challenge when using a proper dose of vaccine that allows for repeated oocyst cycling in the litter post-vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albanese, Grace A; Tensa, Laura R; Aston, Emily J; Hilt, Deborah A; Jordan, Brian J","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d4432caa5cf97afa0126e52aa5dbf2e2fddd2be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coccidiosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viscous gel diluent","gel diluents","gel droplets","litter post-vaccination","Eimeria maxima oocysts","vaccine oocyst shedding","viscous gel group","ingestion of oocysts","number of oocysts","water","vaccination cabinet","multiple time points post-vaccination","days post-challenge body weight gains","different vaccine applications","commercial coccidia vaccine","Eimeria maxima challenge","proper dose of vaccine","sporulated oocysts mass","reduced weight gain","species of Eimeria","cycle","vaccinated groups","significant disease of poultry","repeated oocyst","coccidia vaccines","prevention of coccidiosis","microscopic lesions","poor feed conversion","protection levels","coarse spray","new technology","efficacy","application method","lesion scoring","preening","birds","Fecal samples","higher doses","parasitic protozoan","project","US market","variable viscosities","Chickens","development of necrotic enteritis","chicks","applicator bar","experiment","hatchery","results","decrease"],"language":"en"},

Among the cylindrical-shaped epithelial cells, mucus-producing and caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-expressing cells can be distinguished. Occasionally, the cuboidal-shaped cells also express Cav-1, which suggests that they are precursors of both mucus-producing and Cav-1-expressing cells. Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) impedes the differentiation of Cav-1-expressing cells and shifts the differentiation of cuboidal cells towards mucus-producing cells. In control birds exclusively, the IFE surface shows a mucous membrane, but after IBDV infection, the surfaces of both IFE and FAE are also covered by a mucous membrane. After IBDV infection, the cells of FAE also produce mucus, providing evidence for cell transformation. In late postinfection (pi; 28 d pi), the Cav-1 expression returned in the IFE cells, whereas the follicle (the primary lymphoid organ) underwent atrophy. The appearance of the renewed Cav-1-positive cells is similar to that of the normal basal cell, but they randomly locate in different levels of IFE, suggesting the loss of epithelial polarity. Between days 2 and 7 pi, the Cav-1 expression in the endothelial cells of the cortico-medullary capillary web is variable, which may explain the hemorrhage in several infected birds. The IBDV infection stops the Cav-1 expression and subsequently the cholesterol efflux into the bursal lumen. In the infected birds, the high cholesterol level may further worsen the clinical syndrome of IBDV.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F3di, Ildik\u00F3; Felf\u00F6ldi, Bal\u00E1zs; Mink\u00F3, Krisztina; Benyeda, Zs\u00F3fia; Nagy, N\u00E1ndor; Kiss, Anna L; Palya, Vilmos; Ol\u00E1h, Imre","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90e8a770e0bfa16a66efcdb3697d49e664346461.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFE","FAE","IBDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFE cells","cells of FAE","endothelial cells","positive cells","cuboidal-shaped cells","differentiation of cuboidal cells","differentiation of Cav","cylindrical-shaped epithelial cells","renewed Cav","express Cav","mucus","IBDV infection","IFE surface","expression","infected birds","clinical syndrome of IBDV","different levels of IFE","d pi","mucous membrane","control birds","cholesterol efflux","bursal lumen","cell transformation","high cholesterol level","loss of epithelial polarity","normal basal cell","virulent infectious bursal disease virus","cortico-medullary capillary web","BF","follicle","primary lymphoid organ","interfollicular epithelium","evidence","surfaces","late postinfection","chicken bursa of Fabricius","atrophy","hemorrhage","caveolin","appearance","days","precursors"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the development of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccines expressing the NiV G protein. Characterization of these vaccines in mice demonstrated that a single intramuscular AAV injection was sufficient to induce a potent and long-lasting antibody response. Translational studies in hamsters further demonstrated that all vaccinated animals were protected against lethal challenge with NiV.

Only 2% of the mutations significantly increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. These data demonstrate the vulnerability of HIV-1 protease to single random mutations. When a second random mutagenesis library was constructed from an HIV-1 protease carrying a highly deleterious single mutation (D30N), a higher proportion of mutations with neutral or beneficial effect were found, 26% and 9%, respectively. Importantly, antagonist epistasis was observed between deleterious mutations. In particular, the mutation N88D, lethal for the wild-type protease, restored the wild-type catalytic efficiency when combined with the highly deleterious mutation D30N. The low tolerability to single random substitutions shown here for the wild-type HIV-1 protease contrasts with its in vivo ability to generate an adaptive variation. Thus, the antagonist epistasis between deleterious or lethal mutations may be responsible for increasing the protein mutational robustness and evolvability.","publish_time":"2006-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parera, Mariona; Fern\u00E0ndez, Guerau; Clotet, Bonaventura; Mart\u00EDnez, Miguel Angel","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fc2fcede0c81fc352ecc4a74e89c5d96f0b431b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deleterious mutations","random single mutations","single random mutations","lethal mutations","deleterious single mutation","single random substitutions","single random mutants","wild-type protease","deleterious mutation D30N","wild-type HIV","higher proportion of mutations","wild-type catalytic efficiency","successive fixation of individual mutations","protease contrasts","random mutagenesis library","enzyme catalytic efficiency","model protein","vulnerability of HIV","protein function","Protein evolution","mutation N88D","protein mutational robustness","antagonist epistasis","human immunodeficiency virus type","protein\u0027s tolerability","low tolerability","probability of fixation","beneficial effect","distribution of fitness effects","enzymatic activity","arising variant","studies","evolvability","adaptive variation","data","relevance"],"language":"en"},

Human bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus. It has been detected primarily in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection, but its occurrence, clinical profile, and role as a causative agent of respiratory tract disease are not clear. Methods. We investigated the presence of human bocavirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and selected serum samples obtained from 259 children (median age, 1.6 years) who had been hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing. The samples were analyzed for 16 respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction, virus culture, antigen detection, and serological assays. Results. At least 1 potential etiologic agent was detected in 95% of children, and \u003E1 agent was detected in 34% of children. Human bocavirus was detected in 49 children (19%). A large proportion of the cases were mixed infections with other viruses, but human bocavirus was the only virus detected in 12 children (5%). High viral loads of human bocavirus were noted mainly in the absence of other viral agents, suggesting a causative role for acute wheezing. In addition, infections that had uncertain clinical relevance and low viral loads were prevalent. Human bocavirus DNA was frequently detected in serum specimens obtained from patients with acute wheezing, suggesting systemic infection. Conclusions. Human bocavirus is prevalent among children with acute wheezing and can cause systemic infection. Results suggest a model for bocavirus infection in which high viral loads are potentially associated with respiratory symptoms and low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding. Therefore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis may be important for additional studies of human bocavirus.","publish_time":"2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allander, Tobias; Jartti, Tuomas; Gupta, Shawon; Niesters, Hubert G.

Previous studies have shown that common human coronavirus might be neurotropic, although it was first isolated as a pathogen of the respiratory tract. We noticed that a few patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experienced central nervous symptoms during the course of illness. In the present study, we isolated a SARS coronavirus strain from a brain tissue specimen obtained from a patient with SARS with significant central nervous symptoms. Methods. Using transmission electronic microscopy and nested reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, the causative pathogen was identified in cultures of a brain tissue specimen obtained from the patient with SARS. Histopathologic examination of the brain tissue was performed using the methods of immunohistochemistry analysis and double immunofluorescence staining. Fifteen cytokines and chemokines were detected in the blood of the patient with SARS by means of a bead-based multiassay system. Results. A fragment specific for SARS human coronavirus was amplified from cultures of the brain suspension, and transmission electronic microscopy revealed the presence of an enveloped virus morphologically compatible with a coronavirus isolated in the cultures. Pathologic examination of the brain tissue revealed necrosis of neuron cells and broad hyperplasia of gliocytes. Immunostaining demonstrated that monokine induced by interferon-\u0393 (Mig) was expressed in gliocytes with the infiltration of CD68(\u002B) monocytes/macrophages and CD3(\u002B) T lymphocytes in the brain mesenchyme. Cytokine/chemokine assay revealed that levels of interferon-\u0393\u2013inducible protein 10 and Mig in the blood were highly elevated, although the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were close to normal. Conclusions. This study provides direct evidence that SARS human coronavirus is capable of infecting the central nervous system, and that Mig might be involved in the brain immunopathology of SARS.","publish_time":"2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Jun; Zhong, Shuqing; Liu, Jinghua; Li, Li; Li, Yong; Wu, Xinwei; Li, Zhijie; Deng, Peng; Zhang, Jingqiang; Zhong, Nanshan; Ding, Yanqing; Jiang, Yong","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/306145655e3e9adaf8ceceed760b8372292fae8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107994.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107994/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS human coronavirus","brain immunopathology of SARS","SARS coronavirus strain","brain tissue specimen","brain suspension","brain mesenchyme","common human coronavirus","Mig","cultures","central nervous system","significant central nervous symptoms","transmission electronic microscopy","levels of interferon","interferon-\u0393","chemokines","blood","cytokines","causative pathogen","respiratory tract","Histopathologic examination","present study","broad hyperplasia of gliocytes","methods of immunohistochemistry analysis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","bead-based multiassay system","nested reverse transcription","polymerase chain reaction","necrosis of neuron cells","presence","direct evidence","inducible protein","double immunofluorescence staining","T lymphocytes","enveloped virus","monocytes","macrophages","CD3","patients","chemokine assay","fragment specific","infiltration of CD68","Previous studies","course of illness","monokine","Immunostaining","Background","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies on chemokines have included only small numbers of patients, and the utility of plasma chemokines as prognostic indicators is unclear. Methods: We studied 255 archival plasma samples collected during the first or second week after disease onset. The chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monokine induced by interferon-\u03B3 (MIG), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by cytometric bead array with a 4-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to analyze the production of IP-10 in lung tissue at autopsy. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for adverse disease outcome. Results: Increases in IP-10, MIG, and IL-8 during the first week after onset of fever were associated with adverse outcome (intensive care unit admission or death) in the univariate analysis. During the second week, only MIG concentration was associated with prognosis. After adjusting for other risk factors, plasma IP-10 concentration at the first week remained as an independent prognostic factor, with an odds ratio for adverse outcome of 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.05\u20132.55) per fold increase in plasma IP-10 concentration above the median. During the second week, chemokines provided little independent prognostic information. IP-10 was increased in lung tissue from patients who died of SARS. Conclusions: Increased plasma IP-10 during the first week of SARS symptoms is an independent predictor of outcome. Chemokine activation may be an early event in SARS, and an exaggerated host response may produce complications.","publish_time":"2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung; Wong, Chun-Kwok; To, Ka-Fai; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Sung, Ying-Man; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Sung, Joseph Jao-Yiu; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcce9ff810c5af00b2d2c39f6a09fa275cc51094.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Increased plasma IP","production of IP","adverse disease outcome","utility of plasma chemokines","week of SARS symptoms","independent predictor of outcome","independent prognostic factor","MIG concentration","independent predictors","chemokines interferon-inducible protein","archival plasma samples","little independent prognostic information","adverse outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome","prognostic indicators","Exaggerated activation of cytokines","Chemokine activation","lung tissue","disease onset","activation normal T cell","interferon-\u03B3","onset of fever","exaggerated host response","monocyte chemoattractant protein","small numbers of patients","intensive care unit admission","real-time quantitative PCR","death","odds ratio","RANTES","immunohistochemical staining","Reverse transcription","early event","color FACSCalibur flow cytometer","cytometric bead array","risk factors","fold increase","MCP","complications","Conditional logistic regression","interleukin","Background","monokine","Conclusions","univariate analysis","Previous studies","autopsy","Methods","prognosis","median","confidence interval","Results"],"language":"en"},

External quality control is needed. Methods: We have conducted an international quality assurance study on WNV molecular detection. Participating laboratories tested noninfectious samples inactivated by heat and gamma irradiation. Participants received 7 coded lyophilized samples containing WNV of genetic lineages 1a, 1b, and 2 at 2600 to 18 000 000 RNA copies/mL, 3 samples containing heterologous flaviviruses, and 2 negative samples. Results: Thirty laboratories participated. The average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies/mL onward (probit analysis; 95% CI = 1174\u201324547 copies/mL). Lineages 1a and 1b were detected with equal efficiencies, but the lineage 2 strain (Ug37) was detected at significantly lower rates. Only 27% of participants were able to detect the 6 samples containing \u22651.8 \u00D7 10(4) copies/mL. Three laboratories generated false-positive results in negative samples. Six of 30 laboratories reported correct strain identification in 3 samples containing non-WNV flaviviruses. We observed a significant positive correlation between the capability of detecting non-WNV flaviviruses and detecting WNV lineage 2. Conclusions: Most participants showed good performance in detecting lineage 1 WNV, the predominant virus in the Northern Hemisphere. The inability of some laboratories to detect even highly concentrated lineage 2 WNV downgraded the overall outcome.

Several species of pathogenic bacteria secrete IgA1 proteases at mucosal sites of infection to destroy the structure and function of human IgA1 thereby eliminating an important aspect of host defence. IgA1 proteases are known as autotransporter proteins as their gene structure encodes the information to direct their own secretion out of the bacterial cell. The iga gene structure is also thought to contribute to the antigenic heterogeneity demonstrated by the IgA1 proteases during infections and the cleavage specificity of the IgA1 proteases for human IgA1. The IgA1 proteases have therefore been implicated as important virulence factors that contribute to bacterial infection and colonisation. The development of strategies to inactivate these IgA1 proteases has become the subject of recent research, as this has the potential to reduce bacterial colonisation at mucosal surfaces.","publish_time":"2005-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mistry, Dippica; Stockley, Robert A.","journal":"Int J Biochem Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108436.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgA1 proteases","function of human IgA1","bacterial infection","bacterial colonisation","bacterial cell","iga gene structure","human immunoglobulin A1","mucosal sites of infection","mucosal surfaces","important virulence factors","important aspect of host defence","specific peptide bonds","proteolytic enzymes","cleavage specificity","hinge region sequence","species of pathogenic bacteria","autotransporter proteins","potential","infections","subject of recent research","secretion","information","antigenic heterogeneity","development of strategies"],"language":"en"},

The main weakness of this approach arises from the low efficiency and sporadic nature of the delivery of charge-neutral PMO into muscle fibers, the mechanism of which is unknown. In this study, to test our hypothesis that muscle fibers take up PMO more efficiently during myotube formation, we induced synchronous muscle regeneration by injection of cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior muscle of Dmd exon 52-deficient mdx52 and wild-type mice. Interestingly, by in situ hybridization, we detected PMO mainly in embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating fibers. In addition, we showed that PMO or 2\u2032-O-methyl phosphorothioate is taken up efficiently into C2C12 myotubes when transfected 24\u201372 h after the induction of differentiation but is poorly taken up into undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts suggesting efficient uptake of PMO in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. Next, we tested the therapeutic potential of PMO for laminin-\u03B12 chain-null dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice: a model of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) with active muscle regeneration. We confirmed the recovery of laminin-\u03B12 chain and slightly prolonged life span following skipping of the mutated exon 4 in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice. These findings support the idea that PMO entry into fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on dystrophinless muscle membranes and provide a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.","publish_time":"2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aoki, Yoshitsugu; Nagata, Tetsuya; Yokota, Toshifumi; Nakamura, Akinori; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Partridge, Terence; Takeda, Shin\u0027ichi","journal":"Hum Mol Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6a196e92bebd55ed2ef1989d350df9bce33f8e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["muscle fibers","PMO entry","neutral PMO","PMO-mediated therapies","active muscle regeneration","efficient uptake of PMO","therapeutic potential of PMO","synchronous muscle regeneration","dystrophinless muscle membranes","tibialis anterior muscle of Dmd exon","laminin-\u03B12 chain-null dy","mediated exon skipping","MDC1A","deficient congenital muscular dystrophy","Duchenne muscular dystrophy","mutated exon","variety of muscular disorders","C2C12 myotubes","early stages of C2C12 myotube formation","embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating fibers","undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts","wild-type mice","deficient mdx52","neuromuscular disorders","recovery of laminin","delivery of charge","injection of cardiotoxin","prolonged life span","myogenesis","platform","model of merosin","sporadic nature","treatment","low efficiency","developmental stage","promising approaches","Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer","idea","mechanism","hypothesis","findings","O-methyl phosphorothioate","induction of differentiation","main weakness","situ hybridization","study","addition"],"language":"en"},

Expression of the GalT constructs in either COS or L cells produced two glycoprotein products which differed in molecular mass by 7 kDa. The difference in size between the two products is due to post-translational modiications which are inhibited by brefeldin A and are therefore likely to occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Very little of the high-molecular-weight species was detected for full-length GalT, whereas it was a major product for the GalT/hybrid protein. Only the higher molecular weight species was expressed at the cell surface. Thus, this additional 7 kDa post-translational modification distinguishes molecules retained within the Golgi apparatus (lower M(r) species) from those transported through the TGN to the cell surface. These studies indicate that (i) the level of expression influences the intracellular distribution of GalT/hybrid molecules and (ii) the localization of full-length GalT involves active retention within the Golgi stack, and not retrieval from later compartments. After treatment of membrane preparations from stable L cell clones with a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent, full-length bovine GalT molecules were found almost exclusively as high-molecular-weight aggregates, suggesting that GalT exists as an oligomer or aggregate. This ability to oligomerize may be a requirement for Golgi retention.","publish_time":"1994-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teasdale, Rohan D.; Matheson, Fiona; Gleeson, Paul A.","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6da435b187c0a1ad8d81930acc07cb4e9c2af23.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

Abstract Background COVID-19 is part of the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae. The new pathogen \u03B2-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading to severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Objective To review the available scientific evidence related to the care of the respiratory system in order to establish general treatment guidelines. Methods Narrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search, selection, and review of original and secondary articles written in English or Spanish in the different databases: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to March 2020. Results No specific treatment for the new disease has been defined, with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure. The use of biosecurity elements, such as goggles, hats, gloves, long waterproof aprons, high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel (FFP2 or N95) is recommended. In symptomatic patients use surgical masks, hospital soap, paper towels, and 70% alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Use oxygen through low flow systems. A mechanical ventilation program in VCP or VCV modes, Vt 4-6ml/Kg, Fr\u226435, FiO2 for PaO2 =60mmHg or SpO2 92-96%, PEEP 12-17cmH2O, prone ventilation if PAFI\u2264150 with ratio 16/8 or 18/6, nitric oxide 5-20ppm. Conclusions Use biosecurity equipment in order to prevent transmission. In hypoxaemia use low flow oxygen therapy systems. Use lung protection strategies, decrease in tidal volumes, plateau pressures and respiratory rates, plus implementation of high PEEP values, low conduction pressure values and prone ventilation. These have been shown to improve hypoxaemia and survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chica-Meza, Carmen; Pe\u00F1a-L\u00F3pez, Luis Alexander; Villamar\u00EDn-Guerrero, H\u00E9ctor Fabio; Moreno-Collazos, Jorge Enrique; Rodr\u00EDguez-Corredor, Lizeth Catherine; Lozano, Wilson Mauricio; Vargas-Ordo\u00F1ez, M\u00F3nica Patricia","journal":"Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62463910f09302858f0129a2f04841bd8763b48b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0122726220300318; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0122726220300318","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEDLINE"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["In hypoxaemia","the care of the respiratory system in order","and respiratory","in tidal","part of the family of","written in English or Spanish in the different","In symptomatic patients","identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan","and review of original and secondary","Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading","and prone ventilation","The new pathogen \u03B2","biosecurity equipment in order","specific treatment for the new","coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as","mechanical ventilation program in VCP or VCV","and acute respiratory distress syndrome","improve hypoxaemia and survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome","of biosecurity elements","FFP2 or N95","mmHg or SpO2","with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure","alcohol or isopropyl alcohol","plus implementation of high PEEP","review the available scientific evidence related","nuevo coronavirus","MEDLINE and EMBASE published up","Methods Narrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search","such as","novel coronavirus","PEEP elevados","ventilaci\u00F3n prono","known as Coronaviridae","FiO2 for PaO2","with ratio","CENTRAL","NCBI","prone ventilation if PAFI","low flow oxygen therapy systems","control sintom\u00E1tico","oxygen through low flow systems","s\u00EDndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda","sistema respiratorio","pacientes","17cmH2O","ventilaci\u00F3n mec\u00E1nica","nCoV","Vt","bajo flujo","hipoxemia","ppm","high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel","low conduction pressure","nuevo pat\u00F3geno \u03B2","surgical masks","been defined","severe pneumonia","tapabocas quir\u00FArgico","implementaci\u00F3n de valores","subg\u00E9nero Sarbecovirus","edema pulmonar","modos VCP","paciente sintom\u00E1tico","neumon\u00EDa severa","sistemas de oxigenoterapia","equipos de bioseguridad","elementos de bioseguridad","tratamiento espec\u00EDfico","brote de neumon\u00EDa","bajos valores de presi\u00F3n","establish general treatment","revisi\u00F3n de art\u00EDculos originales","estrategias de protecci\u00F3n pulmonar","Abstract Background COVID","M\u00E9todos Revisi\u00F3n narrativa","These have been shown","pulmonary oedema","selection","alta eficiencia","hospital soap","gorros","bata larga impermeable","cuidado","guantes","long waterproof aprons","paper towels","disminuci\u00F3n de vol\u00FAmenes corrientes","presiones de meseta","hats","frecuencias respiratorias","jab\u00F3n hospitalario","personal sanitario","evidencia cient\u00EDfica disponible relacionada","principal medida terap\u00E9utica","nueva enfermedad","ingl\u00E9s","familia","forma parte","gafas","toallas de papel","conducci\u00F3n","Objective","March","prevent transmission","Results","plateau","pautas generales","espa\u00F1ol","Objetivo","selecci\u00F3n","bases de datos","sobrevida","Conclusions","virus conocida","Resumen Antecedentes","literatura","b\u00FAsqueda","lung protection","ox\u00EDgeno","alteraciones","recommended","\u00F3xido n\u00EDtrico","Conclusiones","nitric","transmisi\u00F3n","Resultados","relaci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

Upon rehydration in our unique 2DPN design, the dried signal enhancement solution reduces the limit-of-detection (LOD) of the device to 5 \u00D7 10(11) nucleic acid copies/mL without increasing false positive detection. Our easy-to-use device retains activity after 28 days of dry storage and produces reliable signal enhancement 40 min after sample application.

However, the consensus method for detecting these viruses has not been well established. A rapid and sensitive microarray approach for detection of these viruses and a panel of specific probes covering nine genera and 16 virus species were designed. 70\u2010mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50\u2010mer oligonucleotides were at the species level, respectively. To decrease the interference of the host genome in hybridization, the consensus genus primers were designed and used to reverse transcribe only virus genome. The synthesis of the second strand was carried out with a random primer sequence (5\u2032\u2010GTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTCNNNNNNNN\u20103\u2032). The amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses. This microarray\u2010based method used the highly conserved consensus primers to synthesize specifically the virus cDNA and could identify effectively Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Tick borne encephalitis virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus.

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Hong; Chen, Xing; Hu, Tao; Li, Juan; Song, Hao; Liu, Yanran; Wang, Peihan; Liu, Di; Yang, Jing; Holmes, Edward C.; Hughes, Alice C.; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Weifeng","journal":"Curr Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81f08eb50af92d224572d05886b2e5ca377715ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096098222030662X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222030662X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Yunnan Province"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","closest relative of SARS","denoted RmYN02","RmYN02 shares","nucleotide identity","novel coronavirus","bats","China","low sequence identity","novel bat-derived coronavirus","insertion events","global scale","complete virus genome","insertion of multiple amino acids","junction site","S2 subunits","major public health impacts","spike","S1","metagenomics analysis of samples","likely natural hosts","unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia","contrast","receptor binding domain","Yunnan Province","RBD","Summary","strong evidence","similar manner","animal betacoronaviruses","angiotensin","enzyme","ACE2","protein","origins","ab gene","date"],"language":"en"},

During 2000\u20132005, five dog and one human rabies cases were imported into France, a rabies-free country since 2001. The Summer 2004 event led to unprecedented media warnings by the French Public Health Director. We investigated medical practice evolution following the official elimination of rabies in 2001; impact of subsequent episodic rabies importations and national newspaper coverage on demand for and delivery of antirabies prophylaxis; regular transmission of epidemiological developments within the French Antirabies Medical Center (ARMC) network; and ARMC discussions on indications of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Annual data collected by the National Reference Center for Rabies NRCR (1989\u20132006) and the exhaustive database (2000\u20132005) of 56 ARMC were analyzed. Weekly numbers of patients consulting at ARMC and their RPEP- and antirabies-immunoglobulin (ARIG) prescription rates were determined. Autoregressive integrated moving-average modeling and regression with autocorrelated errors were applied to examine how 2000\u20132005 episodic rabies events and their related national newspaper coverage affected demand for and delivery of RPEP. A slight, continuous decline of rabies-dedicated public health facility attendance was observed from 2000 to 2004. Then, during the Summer 2004 event, patient consultations and RPEP and ARIG prescriptions increased by 84%, 19.7% and 43.4%, respectively. Moreover, elevated medical resource use persisted in 2005, despite communication efforts, without any secondary human or animal case. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated appropriate responsiveness to reemerging rabies cases and effective newspaper reporting, as no secondary case occurred. However, the ensuing demand on medical resources had immediate and long-lasting effects on rabies-related public health resources and expenses. Henceforth, when facing such an event, decision-makers must anticipate the broad impact of their media communications to counter the emerging risk on maintaining an optimal public health organization and implement a post-crisis communication strategy.","publish_time":"2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lardon, Z\u00E9lie; Watier, Laurence; Brunet, Audrey; Bern\u00E8de, Claire; Goudal, Maryvonne; Dacheux, Laurent; Rotivel, Yolande; Guillemot, Didier; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c498ea64810a8da9cb26c48e1f5e96973537338d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2889823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20582307/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["French Public Health","ARMC","National Reference Center for Rabies NRCR","ARIG","RPEP"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["rabies reemergence","Rabies NRCR","human rabies cases","episodic rabies events","rabies-free areas","rabies-free country","rabies-related public health resources","official elimination of rabies","continuous decline of rabies","indications of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis","impact of subsequent episodic rabies importations","medical resources","delivery of RPEP","French Public Health Director","French Antirabies Medical Center","related national newspaper coverage","optimal public health organization","public health facility attendance","ARMC discussions","Imported cases","delivery of antirabies prophylaxis","National Reference Center","antirabies-immunoglobulin","ensuing demand","medical practice evolution","secondary human","secondary case","Summer","elevated medical resource use","effective newspaper reporting","media communications","broad impact","post-crisis communication strategy","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","ARIG prescriptions","communication efforts","animal case","unprecedented media warnings","long-lasting effects","regular transmission of epidemiological developments","network","Annual data","regression","patient consultations","Autoregressive integrated moving-average modeling","France","emerging risk","appropriate responsiveness","autocorrelated errors","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","expenses","prescription rates","decision-makers","Weekly numbers of patients","CONCLUSIONS","dog","exhaustive database"],"language":"en"},

The CEACAM1 ectodomain, which is composed of four glycosylated immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, is highly flexible and participates in both antiparallel (trans) and parallel (cis) homophilic binding. Membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains form microclusters in which all four Ig domains participate.

Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and \u03D56) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and \u03D56 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (\u00B1SD) of 25.1% (\u00B13.6%) and 18.2% (\u00B19.5%) for the enveloped MHV and \u03D56, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6% (\u00B116.7%) and 85.5% (\u00B124.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7% of MHV and 2% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.","publish_time":"2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Yinyin; Ellenberg, Robert M.; Graham, Katherine E.; Wigginton, Krista R.","journal":"Environ Sci Technol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b427492682816e9df865c8ec719abb3ace67fb16.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dd89b65308fee274fc4883c99ec737375304a368.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b00876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fate of enveloped viruses","nonenveloped viruses","enveloped MHV","model enveloped viruses","important group of viruses","\u03D56","nonenveloped MS2","municipal wastewater","optimized methods","T3","partitioning behavior","mean recoveries","solid fraction of wastewater","raw wastewater samples","nonenveloped bacteriophages","presented methods","environmental fate","optimized ultrafiltration method","future research","influenza","HIV","water environments","SARS","MERS","time scale of days","text","devastating pandemics","outbreaks","results","light","survival","centuries","presence","Ebola","SD","Image","solids","maximum"],"language":"en"},

A 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) also exists in human coronaviruses (CoV) such as 229E and the one causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To combat SARS, we previously had developed peptidomimetic and zinc-coordinating inhibitors of 3CL(pro). As shown in the present study, some of these compounds were also found to be active against 3C(pro) of CV strain B3 (CVB3). Several crystal structures of 3C(pro) from CVB3 and 3CL(pro) from CoV-229E and SARS-CoV in complex with the inhibitors were solved. The zinc-coordinating inhibitor is tetrahedrally coordinated to the His(40)-Cys(147) catalytic dyad of CVB3 3C(pro). The presence of specific binding pockets for the residues of peptidomimetic inhibitors explains the binding specificity.

We investigated differing immunopathogenesis in chickens following infection with IS/885/00-like (885), QX-like (QX) and M41 IBV strains. We confirmed that the histopathological changes, proinflammatory and innate immune gene responses were induced to different magnitudes, depending on the IBV strain. Results indicated that upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03B2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF) expression is induced by IBV M41 in the trachea and by IBV 885 and QX in the kidney, which mainly coincides with tracheal and renal histopathological lesions respectively caused by these strains. In addition, elevated levels of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN-\u03B2 expression occurred concurrently with greater lesion severity in IBV infected trachea and kidney tissues.

On this route, the virus is exposed to destructive fluids of the digestive tract, which are acidic and contain the proteases pepsin (gizzard) or chymotrypsin and trypsin (intestine). Only the latter enzyme activates virus by cleaving hemagglutinin (HA) into HA1 and HA2 subunits. We mimicked the passage of viruses through the gastrointestinal tract by treating them with digestive fluids from chicken and determined titers and integrity of HA by western-blot. Gizzard fluid completely inactivated virions and degrades HA even at a high dilution, but only if the pH was kept acidic. If the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer (mimicking virus uptake with seawater) particles were more resistant. Virions containing an uncleaved HA were even activated suggesting that gastric juice contains a trypsin-like protease. Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles and destroyed HA, but diluted fluid activated virions. A virus isolated from the duck\u00B4s intestine is more tolerant against intestinal fluid compared to fowl plague virus suggesting that the former is better adapted to grow in the intestine. We also demonstrate that influenza viruses replicate to high titers in a novel chicken epithelial gut cell line. While viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site require addition of trypsin, these cells effectively process HA with a polybasic cleavage site, which could be blocked with an inhibitor of the cellular furin protease.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xuejiao; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Veit, Michael","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/286b5527a5e07dc7ff214e6c2b01dfffc72fb805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351930968X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351930968X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["integrity of HA","uncleaved HA","Gizzard fluid","monobasic HA cleavage site","avian viruses","passage of viruses","diluted fluid activated virions","human influenza viruses","digestive tract","inactivated virions","Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles","mimicking virus uptake","fowl plague virus","high titers","gut epithelial cells","respiratory tract","gastrointestinal tract","addition of trypsin","digestive fluids","s intestine","polybasic cleavage site","novel chicken epithelial gut cell line","destructive fluids","high dilution","cellular furin protease","fecal-oral route","seawater","neutral buffer","HA1","chymotrypsin","cleaving hemagglutinin","proteases pepsin","Abstract","contrast","duck","western-blot","inhibitor","enzyme","HA2 subunits","gastric juice","pH"],"language":"en"},

One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction. https://github.com/chjiao/VirBin yannisun@cityu.edu.hk","publish_time":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jiao; Shang, Jiayu; Wang, Jianrong; Sun, Yanni","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01287ad6a470dcfb277604a78e0e702d23c86522.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4c35605124dd8011395240fac71e80b52ddbbe7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/704288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral haplotype reconstruction","contig coverage","viral haplotypes","sequencing viral populations","contig sizes","contig binning tools","different strains","different haplotype abundance distributions","heterogeneous sequencing coverage","different groups","viral diseases","generation sequencing technology","haplotype assembly programs","genome-scale haplotypes","multiple simulated sequencing data","mock quasispecies sequencing data","genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes","different biological properties","precision of VirBin","clusters contigs","RNA viruses","high sequence similarity","prototype-based clustering","high intra-species genetic diversity","sequence composition","novel strains","treatment strategies","extensive research","human health","superior sensitivity","serious threat","effective prevention","comprehensive characterization","cluster regions","vaccine","Influenza","HIV","locus","benchmark results","phenotypic effects","used features","drug design","challenge","Infections","mutations specific","challenging problem","genomes"],"language":"en"},

Objectives We set out to assess the quality of MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics worldwide. Study design Both sensitivity and specificity were assessed using 12 samples containing different viral loads of MERS-CoV or common coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). Results The panel was sent to more than 106 participants, of which 99 laboratories from 6 continents returned 189 panel results.Scores ranged from 100% (84 laboratories) to 33% (1 laboratory). 15% of respondents reported quantitative results, 61% semi-quantitative (Ct-values or time to positivity) and 24% reported qualitative results. The major specific technique used was real-time RT-PCR using the WHO recommended targets upE, ORF1a and ORF1b. The evaluation confirmed that RT-PCRs targeting the ORF1b are less sensitive, and therefore not advised for primary diagnostics. Conclusions The first external quality assessment MERS-CoV panel gives a good insight in molecular diagnostic techniques and their performances for sensitive and specific detection of MERS-CoV RNA globally. Overall, all laboratories were capable of detecting MERS-CoV with some differences in sensitivity. The observation that 8% of laboratories reported false MERS-CoV positive single assay results shows room for improvement, and the importance of using confirmatory targets.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pas, Suzan D.; Patel, Pranav; Reusken, Chantal; Domingo, Cristina; Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian; Dijkman, Ronald; Thiel, Volker; Nowotny, Norbert; Koopmans, Marion P.G.; Niedrig, Matthias","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adfb6209b1ba33b6b1cb11dc9b183f3a9bf074f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106520.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209385/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.05.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001675","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["quality of MERS","CoV RNA","panel results","laboratories","CoV molecular diagnostics","external quality assessment MERS-CoV panel","quantitative results","specific detection of MERS","false MERS-CoV positive single assay results","qualitative results","different viral loads of MERS","ORF1b","sensitivity","molecular diagnostic techniques","RT-PCRs","targets upE","diagnostic protocols","confirmatory targets","primary diagnostics","major specific technique","real-time RT-PCR","discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","room","good insight","performances","common coronaviruses","improvement","OC43","samples","positivity","specificity","Ct-values","importance","Conclusions","continents","Abstract Background","NL63","Study design","ORF1a","Scores","differences","HKU1","evaluation","respondents","participants","observation","Objectives","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

METHOD OF STUDY: Nasopharyngeal samples of patients with respiratory infection were collected, clinical data were analyzed, and immunofluorescence was used to detect hPIV. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 33.63% of respiratory infections. In a total of 11 606 cases of viral respiratory infection, 781 were positive for hPIV; hPIV prevalence ranged from 2.14% to 27% of viral respiratory infections. hPIV1 circulates mainly during fall; hPIV3 circulation, in turn, starts in fall and peaks during spring; and cases of hPIV2 are reported along the year, with peaks in fall and early spring. The most affected age group was children, with hPIV prevalence of 74.23% in patients for less than 1 year. A higher proportion of girls were infected than boys, however, no difference by sex was observed considering all age groups. The most frequent type was hPIV3, especially in hospitalized patients. Both hPIV1 and 3 were associated with dyspnea, while hPIV2 caused mild symptoms mainly in nonhospitalized patients.

CONCLUSION: hPIV causes a high number of respiratory infections, leading to hospitalization especially in children; epidemiological and surveillance studies are important for the control and management of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2019-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gregianini, Tatiana Sch\u00E4ffer; Seadi, Claudete Farina; Zavarize Neto, Luiz Domingos; Martins, Let\u00EDcia Garay; Muller, Guilherme Cerutti; Straliotto, Selir Maria; da Veiga, Ana Beatriz Gorini","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53b8d0b9c0472feda728b084ce1e405ee0c834b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866089/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25459","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["viral respiratory infections","management of respiratory infections","hPIV prevalence","Respiratory viruses","high number of respiratory infections","cases of viral respiratory infection","fall","health burden of hPIV","hPIV1","cases of hPIV2","nonhospitalized patients","children","Nasopharyngeal samples of patients","seasonality of cases","peaks","clinical symptoms","clinical data","age groups","affected age group","important pathogen","mild symptoms","hPIV3 circulation","early spring","METHOD OF STUDY","control","prematurity","chronic diseases","surveillance studies","turn","Rio Grande","Human parainfluenza virus","boys","risk factors","PROBLEM","dyspnea","hospitalization","higher proportion of girls","Brazil","sex","CONCLUSION","frequency","immunofluorescence","total","frequent type","difference","RESULTS","fatalities","years"],"language":"en"},

The current diagnostic microbial standard detects S. pneumoniae in less than 30% of CAP cases. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting autolysin (lytA) is able to increase the rate of detection. The aim of this study is validation of this quantitative PCR in vitro using different available strains and in vivo using clinical samples (oropharyngeal swabs). The PCR autolysin (lytA) was validated by testing the intra- and inter-run variability. Also, the in vitro specificity and sensitivity, including the lower limit of detection was determined. In addition, a pilot-study was performed using samples from patients (n = 28) with pneumococcal pneumonia and patients (n = 28) with a pneumonia without detection of S. pneumoniae with the current diagnostic microbial standard, but with detection of either a viral and or another bacterial pathogen to validate this test further. The intra- and inter-run variability were relatively low (SD\u2019s ranging from 0.08 to 0.96 cycle thresholds). The lower limit of detection turned out to be 1\u201310 DNA copies/reaction. In-vitro sensitivity and specificity of the tested specimens (8 strains carrying lytA and 6 strains negative for lytA) were both 100%. In patients with pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pneumonia a cut-off value of 6.000 copies/mL would lead to a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 85.7%. We were able to develop a quantitative PCR targeting lytA with good in-vitro test characteristics.

These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called \u2018bovine-like CoVs\u2019 proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.","publish_time":"2018-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amer, Haitham Mohamed","journal":"Anim Health Res Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b30e970d817fdc264c7e6f61eda62e29775e650.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108644.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252318000117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["wild cattle","respiratory disease","cattle calves","feedlot cattle","cattle farms","different bovine","Bovine CoV","different disease conditions","wild ruminants","inherent genetic diversity of CoVs","restrictive cattle pathogen","different mammalian","Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV","wild goats","avian host species","distinct virus species","persistence of BCoV","ruminant species","continuous emergence of disease epidemics","wide spectrum of disease syndromes","domesticated ruminants","genetic analyses","interspecies barriers","virus characteristics","host-range variants","lactating cows","winter dysentery","sheep","shipping fever pneumonia","accumulation of point mutations","high frequency of homologous recombination","llama","alpaca","antelopes","deer","new geographical zones","dromedary camel","water buffalo","primary cause of gastroenteritis","nature","ability","variable animal hosts","giraffes","proposed classification","principal determinant","terms of epidemiology","transmission","importance","tissue tropism","ecological variations","Biologic","humans","dogs","presented data","competences","Coronaviruses","review"],"language":"en"},

Difficulties in production scale-up and potential exposure of chicken flocks to avian influenza viruses especially in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak have prompted evaluation and development of alternative non-egg based influenza vaccine manufacturing technologies. As part of MedImmune\u0027s effort to develop the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) using cell culture production technologies we have investigated the use of high yielding, cloned MDCK cells as a substrate for vaccine production by assessing host range and virus replication of influenza virus produced from both SPF egg and MDCK cell production technologies. In addition to cloned MDCK cells the indicator cell lines used to evaluate the impact of producing LAIV in cells on host range and replication included two human cell lines: human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and human muco-epidermoid bronchiolar carcinoma (NCI H292) cells. The influenza viruses used to infect the indicators cell lines represented both the egg and cell culture manufacturing processes and included virus strains that composed the 2006\u20132007 influenza seasonal trivalent vaccine (A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/05 (H3N2) and B/Malaysia/2506/04). Results from this study demonstrate remarkable similarity between influenza viruses representing the current commercial egg produced and developmental MDCK cell produced vaccine production platforms. MedImmune\u0027s high yielding cloned MDCK cells used for the cell culture based vaccine production were highly permissive to both egg and cell produced ca attenuated influenza viruses. Both the A549 and NCI H292 cells regardless of production system were less permissive to influenza A and B viruses than the MDCK cells. Irrespective of the indicator cell line used the replication properties were similar between egg and the cell produced influenza viruses. Based on these study results we conclude that the MDCK cell produced and egg produced vaccine strains are highly comparable.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussain, Althaf I.; Cordeiro, Melissa; Sevilla, Elizabeth; Liu, Jonathan","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/082008a917d64cab01982f294b7eda90864938aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172923.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10003415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20307595/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10003415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MedImmune","MDCK","NCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDCK cell production technologies","developmental MDCK cell","avian influenza viruses","cell culture production technologies","influenza vaccine manufacturing technologies","live attenuated influenza vaccine","human cell lines","ca attenuated influenza viruses","indicator cell lines","influenza seasonal trivalent vaccine","indicators cell lines","vaccine production platforms","virus replication of influenza virus","vaccine strains","pandemic influenza outbreak","SPF egg","cell culture manufacturing processes","production system","MedImmune\u0027s high yielding cloned MDCK cells","NCI H292 cells","production scale","B viruses","current commercial egg","LAIV","development of alternative non-egg","virus strains","human lung carcinoma","host range","replication properties","A549","study","Results","use of high yielding","human muco-epidermoid bronchiolar carcinoma","chicken eggs","MedImmune\u0027s effort","potential exposure of chicken flocks","evaluation","specific-pathogen free","event","substrate","remarkable similarity","New Caledonia","impact","H1N1","H3N2","addition","Wisconsin","Malaysia","Difficulties"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown that NBV can infect and replicate in a wide variety of cell types derived from their natural host (bat), as well as from human, mouse and monkey. Within permissive cells, NBV induced significant cytopathic effects characterised by cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation. To understand the molecular events that underpin NBV infection we examined the host transcriptome and proteome response of two cell types, derived from bat (PaKiT03) and mouse (L929), to characterise differential cellular susceptibility to NBV. RESULTS: Despite significant differences in NBV replication and cytopathic effects in the L929 and PaKiT03 cells, the host response was remarkably similar in these cells. At both the transcriptome and proteome level, the host response was dominated by IFN production and signalling pathways. The majority of proteins up-regulated in L929 and PaKiT03 cells were also up-regulated at the mRNA (gene) level, and included many important IFN stimulated genes. Further functional experimentation demonstrated that stimulating IFN signalling prior to infection, significantly reduced NBV replication in PaKiT03 cells. Moreover, inhibiting IFN signalling (through specific siRNAs) increased NBV replication in L929 cells. In line with the significant cytopathic effects seen in PaKiT03 cells, we also observed a down-regulation of genes involved in cell-cell junctions, which may be related to the fusogenic effects of NBV. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new multi-dimensional insights into the host response of mammalian cells to NBV infection. We show that IFN activity is capable of reducing NBV replication, although it is unlikely that this is solely responsible for the reduced replication of NBV in L929 cells. The molecular events that underpin the fusogenic cytopathic effects described here will prove valuable for identifying potential therapeutic targets against fusogenic orthoreovirus.

We estimated medically attended RSV seasonal incidence in a community cohort of adults \u226550 years old during four influenza seasons (2006\u201307 through 2009\u201310). METHODS: Patients seeking care for acute respiratory illness (ARI) were prospectively enrolled and tested for RSV by multiplex RT-PCR. Results from enrolled patients were used to estimate projected cases among non-enrolled patients with ARI. The seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV was the sum of actual and projected cases divided by the community cohort denominator. Since each enrollment period did not include the entire RSV season, incidence estimates were adjusted to account for the statewide proportion of RSV occurring outside the study enrollment period. RESULTS: There were 16,088 to 17,694 adults in the cohort each season and 164 RSV cases in all 4 seasons. The overall seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV was 154 episodes (95% CI, 132\u2013180) per 10,000 persons; the incidence was highest in 2007\u201308 (179) and lowest in 2006\u201307 (110).

Although antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin has been assessed for several bacterial pathogens, not all the important bacterial pathogens that are involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex have been studied. Therefore the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on bovine respiratory pathogen Histophilus somni. Four, 30-mer peptides corresponding to the functional region of NK-lysin helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity on four bovine pneumonic H. somni isolates. Although there were some differences in the efficiency of bactericidal activity among the NK-lysin peptides at lower concentrations (2\u20135 \u03BCM), all four peptides effectively killed most H. somni isolates at higher concentrations (10\u201330 \u03BCM) as determined by a bacterial killing assay. Confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of Live/Dead Baclight stained H. somni (which were preincubated with NK-lysin peptides) were consistent with the killing assay findings and suggest NK-lysin peptides are bactericidal for H. somni. Among the four peptides, NK2A-derived peptide consistently showed the highest antimicrobial activity against all four H. somni isolates. Electron microscopic examination of H. somni following incubation with NK-lysin revealed extensive cell membrane damage, protrusions of outer membranes, and cytoplasmic content leakage. Taken together, the findings from this study clearly demonstrate the antimicrobial activity of all four bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides against bovine H. somni isolates.","publish_time":"2017-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dassanayake, Rohana P.; Falkenberg, Shollie M.; Briggs, Robert E.; Tatum, Fred M.; Sacco, Randy E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e55df621c9df11f9127cdb8829686868bd2ec1cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5565109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827826/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183610","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NK-lysin peptides","antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin","porcine NK-lysin","Bovine NK-lysins","NK-cells","somni isolates","derived peptides","lysin helices","mer peptides","functional region of NK","bovine respiratory pathogen Histophilus somni","highest antimicrobial activity","antibacterial activity","bovine respiratory disease complex","efficiency of bactericidal activity","bacterial killing assay","killing assay findings","important bacterial pathogens","\u03BCM","NK2A-derived peptide","lower concentrations","higher concentrations","present study","Electron microscopic examination of","protrusions of outer membranes","flow cytometric analysis of Live","extensive cell membrane damage","Dead Baclight stained","incubation","human granulysin","cytoplasmic content leakage","granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes","differences","objective"],"language":"en"},

In our study calf diarrhea was reported in 184 out of 2308 camels examined clinically during one year, the prevalence of diarrhea was found to be 8.0% in calves ranging from one month to one year. In the present study group A rotavirus and Brucella abortus were detected in 14.7% and 8.98%, respectively, using ELISA technique. Escherichia coli was isolated from diarrheic calf camel (58.2%) 99/170 samples during dry and wet season. Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected in 12% and 8.8% of the specimens, respectively. In this study enterotoxogenic E. coli (ET E. coli) was isolated from 7% of diarrheic camel, which indicates the strong correlation between the camel calf diarrhea and the detection of enterotoxogenic E. coli. This study represented the first report for the detection of group A rotavirus and B. abortus antigen and antibodies in calf camels in Saudi Arabia.

We aimed to further study seasonality of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens in relation to antibiotic use, as well as meteorological parameters. METHODS: An ecologic study of antibiotic exposure, meteorological parameters, detection of respiratory viruses and clinical isolates of Clostridioides difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (grouped together as gram-negative bacteria; GNB) in Rhode Island from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: Peak detection of C. difficile occurred 3 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.07\u20131.43; P = 0.006). Peak MRSA detection was noted 7 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.21\u20132.35; P = 0.003) and 10 months after the peak in respiratory virus detection (OR = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.06; P = 0.003). Peak GNB detection was noted 2 months after the peak mean monthly ambient temperature (OR = 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.20\u20132.39; P = 0.004). Peak detection of S. pneumoniae was noted at the same time as the peak in detection of respiratory viruses (OR = 1.01, 95% C.I., 1.00\u20131.01; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct seasonal variation in detection of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. C. difficile seasonality may, in part, be related to antibiotic prescriptions filled; GNB seasonality may be related to ambient temperature and S. pneumoniae may be related to concurrent respiratory viral infections.

The study cohort was drawn from a prospective longitudinal survey of CARV in allo-HCT recipient having respiratory symptoms conducted from December 2013 to December 2018 at two Spanish transplant centers. Respiratory viruses in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens were tested using multiplex PCR panel assays.

Thirty patients (13%) had died at 3 months after CARV detection, of which 25 (83%) were recipients developing CARV within the first 6 months after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for mortality: ATG used as part of conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.21\u20136.4, p = 0.01], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 3.4, 95% C.I. 1.4\u20138.4, p = 0.007), CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (OR 3.04, 95% C.I. 1.1\u20138.7, p = 0.03), and absolute lymphocyte count \u003C0.2 \u00D7 109/L (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1\u20135.3, p = 0.04).

In this study, the biological relevance of APN as a receptor for PDCoV was tested by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the APN gene, ANPEP, in pigs. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from ANPEP knockout (KO) pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection. However, lung fibroblast-like cells, derived from the ANPEP KO PAM cultures, supported PDCoV infection to high levels. The results suggest that APN is a receptor for PDCoV in PAMs but is not necessary for infection of lung-derived fibroblast cells. The infection of the ANPEP KO pigs with PDCoV further confirmed that APN is dispensable as a receptor for PDCoV.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stoian, Ana; Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Petrovan, Vlad; Sheahan, Maureen; Samuel, Melissa S.; Whitworth, Kristin M.; Wells, Kevin D.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Beaton, Benjamin; Cigan, Mark; Prather, Randall S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3791bd8502d747fe86d0b291a01943a62cfd6a2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112016.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32056711/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219303496; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219303496","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","APN","ANPEP KO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV infection","receptor","ANPEP KO pigs","ANPEP knockout","APN gene","infection of lung","biological relevance of APN","ANPEP KO PAM cultures","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","PAMs","PEDV","porcine deltacoronavirus","TGEV","lung fibroblast","derived fibroblast cells","Porcine alveolar macrophages","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","important sources of neonatal diarrhea","resistance","pig farms","Cas9","coronaviruses","CRISPR","aminopeptidase N","high levels","requirement","study","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days. RESULTS: Our study found that the patient\u2019s condition worsened in the first week after admission; white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased. On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values. From 8-14 days of admission, the patient\u2019s condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly. On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased. Although red blood cells (RBCs) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis. In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Guoguang; Wang, Jing","journal":"Clin Chim Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18b0edf09a94db43af9d82f1436270961b2baa11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217800.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405079/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301881?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301881","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days of admission","day of admission","red blood cells","routine blood parameters","white blood cells","CRP","treatment of patients","severe COVID","monocytes","routine blood indicators","prognosis of COVID","neutrophil lymphocyte ratio","recovery time of eosinophils","hemoglobin","red blood cell distribution width","neutrophils","dynamic changes","diagnosis","RDW","treatment process","NLR","platelet lymphocyte ratio","lymphocytes","treatment effect","low levels","PLR","patient\u2019s condition","erythrocyte parameters","number of WBCs","lowest values","high values","recovery of hematopoiesis","Novel coronavirus infectious disease","erythrocytes","nucleic acid test","platelets","week","C-reactive protein","PLT","RBCs","epidemiological history","BACKGROUND","hypoxemia","evaluation","CONCLUSIONS","tracking laboratory indexes","progress","countries","eosinophil counts","study","Hb","reference","great value","mechanical ventilation","certain range","regions","RESULTS","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder\u2019s interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost\u2013benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. \u201CDigital\u201D savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moro Visconti, Roberto; Morea, Donato","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbc79eb548d06f97e3ef7e031af2a778c11e9711.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital","PF","PPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consistency of digital platforms","digital applications","Digital technologies","benefit analysis of digital health","healthcare public","networking effects of platforms","infrastructural technology","infrastructural PPPs","PF patterns","massive healthcare intervention","impact of healthcare digitalization","incentivizing value","health issues","private partnerships","private players","P4P schemes","PPP interactions","disconnected nodes","stakeholding nodes","creation patterns","patient-centric","comprehensive PPP ecosystem","patient-centered satisfaction","supply chain bottlenecks","digitized supply chains","scalable value of networks","technology-enabled business model","decongesting hospitals","smart hospital project financing","network theory","solutions","long-term payback","expensive investment","key stakeholders","exchanges","complexity","infectious disease surveillance","stakeholder relationships","literature","coronavirus pandemic","timely big data","interacting agents","contingent costs","empirical case","innovative approach","Efficient sharing","bridging link","sustainability","savings","stakeholder\u2019s interaction","performance","incentives","paper","study"],"language":"en"},

For dust mite and cockroach allergens, there is a dose response relationship between domestic exposure and sensitization. Given that allergen provocation can induce many of the features of asthma, the findings strongly suggest that there is a causal relationship between allergen exposure in the home and asthma. However, it remains unclear at what time the critical exposure occurs (ie, in infancy or later) and what role allergen exposure has played in the increasing prevalence and severity of asthma. Objective evidence of an immune response to allergens is generally not present until after 2 years of age. Viral infections play several different roles in asthma in childhood. In infancy, respiratory syncytial virus infection can induce bronchiolitis and set up recurrent wheezing over the next few years. However, the risk factors for this are maternal smoking and small lungs at birth, rather than allergy. By contrast, the role of rhinovirus in precipitating attacks in children and young adults is strongly associated with allergy. Thus the likely scenario is that allergen exposure over the first few years of life induces sensitization (ie, TH2 cells and IgE antibodies). Continuing exposure can maintain inflammation in the nose and lungs. However, many other factors contribute to wheezing such that there is no simple relationship between allergen exposure and asthma. Nonetheless, it is clear that the changes that have increased asthma have acted on allergic children.

In addition, it is believed to function as a defense against viruses and transposons. In recent years, RNAi has become a widely used approach for studying gene function by targeted cleavage of a specific RNA. Moreover, the technology has been developed as a new therapeutic option that has already made its way into clinical testing. Treatment of viral infections remains a serious challenge due to the emergence of new viruses and strain variation among known virus species. RNAi holds great promise to provide a flexible approach that can rapidly be adapted to new viral target sequences. A major challenge in the development of an efficient RNAi approach still remains the design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with high silencing potency. While large libraries with validated siRNAs exist for silencing of endogenously expressed genes in human or murine cells, siRNAs still have to be designed individually for new antiviral approaches. The present chapter describes strategies to design highly potent siRNAs by taking into consideration thermodynamic features of the siRNA, as well as the structural restrictions of the target RNA. Furthermore, assays for testing the siRNAs in reporter assays as well as options to improve the properties of siRNAs by the introduction of modified nucleotides will be described. Finally, experimental setups will be outlined to test the siRNAs in assays with infectious viruses.","publish_time":"2010-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rothe, Diana; Wade, Erik J.; Kurreck, Jens","journal":"Antiviral RNAi","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69faaacdd695a0b0d366b8bb3b98a94ce3176085.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21431692/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-037-9_17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potent siRNAs","validated siRNAs","properties of siRNAs","specific RNA","emergence of new viruses","efficient RNAi approach","new viral target sequences","RNA interference","sequence-specific target RNA degradation","flexible approach","infectious viruses","new therapeutic option","new antiviral approaches","gene function","reporter assays","serious challenge","gene regulation","major challenge","clinical testing","high silencing potency","Treatment of viral infections","design of small interfering RNAs","strain variation","plants","conserved mechanism","targeted cleavage","known virus species","human","development","animals","consideration thermodynamic features","essential role","genes","strategies","murine cells","great promise","options","large libraries","structural restrictions","introduction of modified nucleotides","way","present chapter","defense","transposons","recent years","experimental setups","technology","addition"],"language":"en"},

Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed cases worldwide. The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd February, and the number of related cases is still increasing. Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System\u0027s capacity. WHO underlines the importance of specific disease regional estimates. Because of this, Italy aimed to put in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production of personal protective equipment. Our aim is to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people expected. Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020. To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios. We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia.

To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. Methods The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. Results We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19.

The advent of electron microscopy and molecular biology showed that diarrhea could also be caused by viruses, both in humans and in other animals. In 1969, electron microcopy was used to show, for the first time, the responsibility of a virus in a case of calf diarrhea. This \u201C reo-like virus \u201D was subsequently identified as a rotavirus, and was shown only four years later to be responsible for severe diarrhea in young children. Noroviruses, and particularly the human virus Norwalk, were subsequently discovered, followed by coronavirus, sapovirus, pestivirus, astrovirus, enteric adenoviruses, torovirus, and picobirnavirus. Some of viruses found in animals, and particularly rotaviruses, can also infect humans. Rotaviruses have been identified in numerous animal species and are generally host-specific, but zoonotic transmission has been suggested by cross-infection (especially in experimental models), by genetic studies showing a close relationship between certain human and animal rotaviruses, and by the discovery of new animal genotypes during epidemiological surveillance of human rotaviroses. Some animal strains of norovirus, sapovirus, picobirnavirus and astrovirus are genetically related to human strains, but their human transmission has not been demonstrated.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brugere-Picoux, Jeanne; Tessier, Philippe","journal":"Bulletin de l\u0027Acad\u00E9mie Nationale de M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7f625a8d2dc886b2ec4e6af3f93518f263ffb59.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919321740; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919321740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human strains","animal rotaviruses","human transmission","certain human","human virus Norwalk","severe diarrhea","animal strains of norovirus","astrovirus","epidemiological surveillance of human rotaviroses","sapovirus","numerous animal species","case of calf diarrhea","picobirnavirus","humans","animals","discovery of new animal genotypes","SUMMARY Etiologic investigations of infectious diarrhea","zoonotic transmission","electron microcopy","advent of electron microscopy","close relationship","genetic studies","enteric adenoviruses","pestivirus","molecular biology","experimental models","young children","torovirus","cross-infection","responsibility","bacteria","coronavirus","years","time","Noroviruses","protozoa","reo"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Review of 913 randomly selected practice Web sites and associated social media accounts in January and August 2016. SETTING: Obstetric practice Web sites and associated social media accounts, United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of obstetric practice Web sites and linked social media accounts providing Zika virus information. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent and 35% of obstetric practice Web sites had information posted about Zika virus in January 2016 and August 2016, respectively. Between the 2 time points, the proportion of practices posting Zika virus content on Facebook and Twitter declined (Facebook: 15% in January, 9% in August; Twitter: 12% in January, 8% in August). In August, the most frequently observed Zika virus\u2013related content themes were the use of insect repellent (14%) and travel advisories (14%). At both time points, practices affiliated with large university hospitals were more likely to have posted information on Zika virus than independent OB/GYN-only practices: January: odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 5.68 (3.50-9.20); August: OR (95% CI) = 8.37 (5.31-13.17). Similarly, practices associated with nonuniversity hospitals were more likely to have posted information than independent OB/GYN-only practices: January: OR (95% CI) = 2.71 (1.88-3.92); August: OR (95% CI) = 6.75 (4.75-9.60). CONCLUSION: Obstetric care practices are not fully utilizing their practice Web sites to relay Zika virus information to their patients. Since practitioner-sponsored Web sites have the capacity to directly reach the populations at greatest risk for Zika virus complications, public health professionals should consider adapting their materials and provider outreach campaigns to more easily accommodate Web site\u2013based information dissemination during this type of public health emergency. There must be greater recognition of the value information gains in the eyes of the patient when it is validated by their own provider, especially when that patient is part of the highest-risk population for a given emergency. Public health organizations should strive to minimize the burden it takes for providers to relay useful resources to patients in order to maximize the impact that those resources can have.","publish_time":"2017-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehnert, Jonathan D.; Ellingson, Mallory K.; Goryoka, Grace W.; Kasturi, Raghuraj; Maier, Emily; Chamberlain, Allison T.","journal":"J Public Health Manag Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b51603b65f40d384c4aa0f11379f0dcc387e46b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5636051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28125540/; https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000000537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Facebook and Twitter","OB"],"locations":["United States of America"],"keyphrases":["Zika virus information","Zika virus content","Zika virus complications","observed Zika virus","Proportion of obstetric practice Web sites","selected practice Web sites","current use of obstetric practice Web sites","practitioner-sponsored Web sites","proportion of practices","Obstetric care practices","based information dissemination","value information gains","social media accounts","patients","public health professionals","Public health organizations","type of public health emergency","independent OB","GYN","Facebook","time points","Twitter","greatest risk","given emergency","nonuniversity hospitals","useful resources","related content themes","use of insect repellent","highest-risk population","large university hospitals","provider outreach campaigns","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","materials","populations","United States of America","providers","order","greater recognition","eyes","Review","capacity","SETTING","PARTICIPANTS","impact","CONCLUSION","percent","burden","DESIGN","OBJECTIVE","confidence interval","odds ratio","travel advisories","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A new, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the rapid (within 1h), simultaneous detection of A and B group HRSV. Primers specific for groups A and B were designed to amplify the N and L genes of HRSV, respectively. A fluorescent dye, calcein, was used as an indicator for the endpoint visual detection and/or real-time amplification of HRSV RNA. The detection limit of the new method was 281.17 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml for HRSV A and 1.58 TCID50/ml for HRSV B. To evaluate the validity of this method, a comparison with RT-PCR was performed using 77 nasopharyngeal swabs as samples. Both RT-LAMP and RT-PCR detected HRSV in 38 HRSV samples, yielding a positive rate of 49%. Of the RT-LAMP positive samples, 36 (95%) were also positive by RT-PCR, while two were negative by RT-PCR. Among the 36 RT-LAMP and RT-PCR positive samples, 11 belonged to HRSV group A, while 25 belonged to group B.

Objectives To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. Study design A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon gene\u2019s hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Results HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children \u003C 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. Conclusions During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Meng-chuan; Guo, Ying-hui; Qiu, Fang-zhou; Wang, Le; Yang, Shuo; Feng, Zhi-shan; Li, Gui-xia","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/371d7e7883a4ced834f4f1d385076ba9ad874a22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106522.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31901884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302847; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Results HAdV","HAdV-positive specimens","HAdV-positives cases","molecular characteristics of HAdV infections","clinical data of different types of HAdV","ARTI","hospitalized children","positive patients","clinical information","predominant types","severe clinical outcome","retrospective study","study period","longer duration of fever","Pediatric patients","respiratory pathogens","Hebei Province","Northern China","hexon neutralization epitope","hexon gene\u2019s hypervariable region","acute respiratory tract infection","nested polymerase chain reaction","statistical product","service solutions","SPSS","typing","month longitudinal","Abstract Background Human adenovirus","sequencing","common pathogen","higher prevalence","spring","software","rhinovirus","genotypes","Conclusions","years old","HRV","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

A safe and cost-effective strategy might be to conduct basic, just-in-time PPE training to enhance familiarity with donning, doffing, and mobility, and couple this with the use of personnel who have maximal proficiency in the relevant emergency skill, instead of more expensive, continuous, skills-focused PPE training.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sule, Harsh; Kulkarni, Miriam; Sugalski, Gregory; Murano, Tiffany","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5196f906a363410d52e3a79ec4b64b4f20ec6fd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time PPE training","PPE groups","Level C PPE","intravenous cannulation","skills-focused PPE training","VL","video laryngoscopy","endotracheal intubation","ultrasound guidance","peripheral IV cannulation","direct laryngoscopy","use of adjuncts","significant difference","relevant emergency skill","maximal proficiency","Conclusions Existing skill proficiency","use of personnel","addition of adjuncts","impact of Level C personal protective equipment","case-control study of emergency medicine resident physicians","donning","familiarity","doffing","couple","subjects","cost-effective strategy","mobility","Methods","median times","advantage","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Calves within each block were allocated to one of 3 treatments: remaining untreated, fed with SCFP (Diamond V SmartCare\u00AE at 1 g/d in milk and NutriTek\u00AE at 5 g/d in starter grain) for the first 63 days of life, or treated with halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg/d) for the first 7 days of life. Fecal samples collected on days 4\u201321 post-partum were examined for both Cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen. The presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life. Calves were weighed at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days of age. Almost all calves were Cryptosporidium-positive at least once during the study. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups. Based on the coproantigen scores, both halofuginone and SCFP feeding significantly reduced the intensity of Cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group. Diarrhea was recorded in almost all calves at least once. Neither the proportion of diarrheic calves nor the intensity and duration of diarrhea differed among the 3 treatment groups significantly. The mean daily weight gain during the first 3 weeks of life was significantly lower in halofuginone treated calves than in both other groups; however, at the end of the study period the total weight gain did not significantly differ among the 3 treatment groups. In conclusion, the clinical results and weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation with the SCFP were neither better nor worse than the 7-day halofuginone treatment suggesting that the SCFP feeding may be from the clinical point of view a natural alternative measure, instead of halofuginone treatment, in bovine cryptosporidiosis.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"V\u00E9lez, Juan; Lange, Malin K.; Zieger, Peter; Yoon, Ilkyu; Failing, Klaus; Bauer, Christian","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079829/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401719300822; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401719300822","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment groups","day halofuginone treatment","days of life","pre-weaned calves","SCFP feeding","Cryptosporidium-positive","intensity of Cryptosporidium infection","neonatal female calves","proportion of diarrheic calves","number of Cryptosporidium","Cryptosporidium oocysts","intensity of diarrhea","weeks of life","Cryptosporidium parvum infection","days of age","total weight gain","mean daily weight gain","study period","positive fecal samples","duration of diarrhea","weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation","clinical results","clinical point","untreated group","coproantigen scores","effect of non-GMO Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products","natural alternative measure","NutriTek","commercial dairy farm","Diamond V SmartCare","milk","end","individual hutches","starter grain","post-partum","blocks","conclusion","bovine cryptosporidiosis","date of birth","animals","presence","treatments","objective"],"language":"en"},

Recent identification in mammalian and teleost fish of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and their mitochondrial adaptor: the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, also called IPS-1, highlight their important role in the induction of IFN at the early stage of a virus infection. More recently, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor: the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, also called MITA, ERIS and MPYS, has been shown to play a pivotal role in response to both non-self-cytosolic RNA and dsDNA. In this study, we cloned STING cDNAs from zebrafish and showed that it was an ortholog to mammalian STING. We demonstrated that overexpression of this ER protein in fish cells led to a constitutive induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). STING-overexpressing cells were almost fully protected against RNA virus infection with a strong inhibition of both DNA and RNA virus replication. In addition, we found that together with MAVS, STING was an important player in the RIG-I IFN-inducing pathway. This report provides the demonstration that teleost fish possess a functional RLR pathway in which MAVS and STING are downstream signaling molecules of RIG-I.

A truncated S protein of the TW1 strain, STR2 (88kDa), carrying three S fragments (S74\u2013253, S294\u2013739, and S1129\u20131255) was investigated to study the influences of intron and exon splicing enhancers to improve STR2 protein expression in mammalian cells. Our results showed that STR2 protein expression with the use of an 138 base-pair intron addition increased by 1.9-, 2.5-, and 4.1-fold in Vero E6, QBI-293A cells, and CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells (dihydrofolate reductase [dhfr] gene deficient CHO cells), respectively. Using the exon splicing enhancers, including a bidirectional splicing enhancer (BSE) or an exon splicing enhancer derived from the EDA alternative exon of the fibronectin gene (EDA ESE), were also found to increase STR2 protein expression in CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells by 1.7- and 2.6-fold. Nevertheless, combination of the intron and the exon splicing enhancers resulted in suppressing the intron-enhancing e STR2 protein expression in in CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells. Our studies also demonstrated the STR2 protein was mainly as the Endo H-sensitive glycoprotein (115kDa) expressed in Vero E6, QBI-293A, and CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells. However, only a minor form of the Endo H-resistant glycoproteins (\u223C130kDa) was detected in CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells. Taken together, our results indicated that intron had a better enhancing effect on STR2 protein expression than exon splicing enhancers, and the expression of \u223C130kDa STR2 glycoprotein was enhanced by the intron addition into the expression vector construct. Results of the present study can provide an optimal strategy to enhance SARS-CoV S protein expression in mammalian cells and may contribute to the development of SARS-CoV subunit vaccine.","publish_time":"2006-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chia-Yin; Hong, Willy W.L.; Chong, Pele; Wu, Suh-Chin","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1028482920fd657931639a79912e9d68f71478d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115599.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X05009497; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X05009497","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHO","EDA","EDA ESE","Endo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["e STR2 protein expression","dhFr","SARS-CoV S protein expression","mammalian cells","truncated S protein","kDa STR2 glycoprotein","gene deficient CHO cells","enhancers","influences of intron","expression vector construct","EDA alternative exon","results","bidirectional splicing enhancer","development of SARS","S fragments","base-pair intron addition","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","CoV subunit vaccine","vaccine development","QBI","Vero E6","fold","Endo H-sensitive glycoprotein","fibronectin gene","Endo H-resistant glycoproteins","EDA ESE","present study","better enhancing effect","dihydrofolate reductase","TW1 strain","optimal strategy","BSE","use","minor form","S294","S74","spike","combination","studies","S1129"],"language":"en"},

Abstract More than 80% of the cases of respiratory infections in children are of viral origin. Viral culture has been the reference method for the diagnosis of viral respiratory infections for years, but there is now a tendency to replace viral culture by molecular biology techniques, notably real-time PCR-based assay, because of its excellent sensitivity and good feasibility. Currently in most laboratories, however, diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is still done using techniques based on detection of viral antigens, especially immunofluorescence assays. Rapid diagnostic tests for use outside of laboratories are now available on the open market, and even if their sensitivity remains lower than that of other techniques, it is likely that they will become widely used, especially in doctors\u0027 offices, in the near future. New methods for the diagnosis of viral infections based on DNA microarray technologies are currently under investigation and appear to very promising.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leruez-Ville, M.","journal":"Revue Fran\u00E7aise d\u0027Allergologie et d\u0027Immunologie Clinique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3073763b3b066ab119e0f7861c2cdefa8160d200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7143589.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0335745706002139; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0335745706002139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections based","Viral culture","the diagnosis","infections respiratoires reposant","nouvelles techniques de diagnostic","diagnostic des infections virales respiratoires","viral antigens","other techniques","viral origin","respiratory infections in children","viral respiratory infections is still done using techniques based","the cases","aide de techniques reposant","tests de diagnostic rapide","Rapid diagnostic tests","molecular biology techniques","in the near future","techniques de biologie mol\u00E9culaire","the open market","especially in doctors","the reference method","Currently in most laboratories","based assay","culture cellulaire","but there is now","especially immunofluorescence assays","tendency to","now available","excellente sensibilit\u00E9","cours de mise","technique de r\u00E9f\u00E9rence","even if their sensitivity remains lower than that","it is likely that they will become widely used","currently under investigation","its excellent sensitivity","Abstract More than","notably real-time PCR","appear to very promising","detection","DNA microarray technologies","because","offices","years","however","outside","temps r\u00E9el","raison","utilisation de puce","\u00E9vidence des antig\u00E8nes viraux","good feasibility","cabinet m\u00E9dical","plupart des laboratoires","New methods","ADN","enfant","g\u00E9n\u00E9ralisation","usage","ann\u00E9es","point","march\u00E9","bonne praticabilit\u00E9","dehors","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","pratique courante","origine virale"],"language":"fr"},

However, some NDV strains, such as Beaudette C (BC), may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use, and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic. We therefore modified the BC strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain LaSota. Additionally, the BC, F, and HN proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication. These modified BC-derived vectors and the LaSota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin (HA) protein of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV). In general, the modified BC-based vectors expressing HA replicated better than LaSota/HA, and expressed higher levels of HA protein. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens. Based on in vitro characterization, two of the modified BC vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against H5N1 HPAIV A/Vietnam/1203/04. Immunization of chickens with rNDV vector vaccines followed by challenge with HPAIV demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality. However, only those chickens immunized with modified BC/HA in which residues 271\u2013330 from the F protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NDV AKO strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding.

The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls.

However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI\u2013 viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI\u2013 mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI\u2013, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system. We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.","publish_time":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Capraro, Gerald A.; Johnson, John B.; Kock, Nancy D.; Parks, Griffith D.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdd71476c2fcf4654a0669f186c68770594b7d25.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7dd9dcdfc9cf0fed538df9e01f16297f1666e03e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2574746.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208002067; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.03.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456301/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2574746?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208002067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SV5-P","V-CPI","V mutants","effect of P","IFN responses","V gene substitutions","V mutant viruses","V gene mutations","SV5 growth","WT virus","effect of SV5","equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses","panel of SV5","adaptive immune responses","higher antiviral antibody responses","fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses","low dose of WT rSV5","potent activators of innate responses","poor inducer of host cell responses","virus growth","higher viral titers","Intranasal infection of ferrets","ferret animal model system","human tissue culture cells","distinct animal model systems","Intranasal infection of mice","mouse cells","mouse system","differential induction of IFN secretion","adaptive immunity phenotypes","human cell lines","phenotypes similar","non-cytopathic paramyxovirus Simian Virus","dose-dependent increase","high levels of apoptosis","primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts","doses","hypothesis","interferon","beta","respiratory tract","studies","animals","ability","tracheal tissues","data","proinflammatory cytokines"],"language":"en"},

The N protein consists of two structural domains interspersed between intrinsically disordered regions and dimerizes through the C-terminal structural domain (CTD). A key activity of the protein is the ability to oligomerize during capsid formation by utilizing the dimer as a building block, but the structural and mechanistic bases of this activity are not well understood. By disulfide trapping technique we measured the amount of transient oligomers of N protein mutants with strategically located cysteine residues and showed that CTD acts as a primary transient oligomerization domain in solution. The data is consistent with the helical oligomer packing model of N protein observed in crystal. A systematic study of the oligomerization behavior revealed that altering the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion through changes in solution salt concentration or phosphorylation-mimicking mutations affects oligomerization propensity.

NAs of avian, but not human viruses, contain a functional 2(nd) sialic acid (SIA)-binding site (2SBS) adjacent to the catalytic site, which contributes to sialidase activity against multivalent substrates. The receptor-binding specificity and potentially crucial contribution of the 2SBS to the HA-NA balance of virus particles is, however, poorly characterized. Here, we elucidated the receptor-binding specificity of the 2SBS of N2 NA and established an important role for this site in the virion HA-NA-receptor balance. NAs of H2N2/1957 pandemic virus with or without a functional 2SBS and viruses containing this NA were analysed. Avian-like N2, with a restored 2SBS due to an amino acid substitution at position 367, was more active than human N2 on multivalent substrates containing \u03B12,3-linked SIAs, corresponding with the pronounced binding-specificity of avian-like N2 for these receptors. When introduced into human viruses, avian-like N2 gave rise to altered plaque morphology and decreased replication compared to human N2. An opposite replication phenotype was observed when N2 was combined with avian-like HA. Specific bio-layer interferometry assays revealed a clear effect of the 2SBS on the dynamic interaction of virus particles with receptors. The absence or presence of a functional 2SBS affected virion-receptor binding and receptor cleavage required for particle movement on a receptor-coated surface and subsequent NA-dependent self-elution. The contribution of the 2SBS to virus-receptor interactions depended on the receptor-binding properties of HA and the identity of the receptors used. We conclude that the 2SBS is an important and underappreciated determinant of the HA-NA-receptor balance. The rapid loss of a functional 2SBS in pandemic viruses may have served to balance the novel host receptor-repertoire and altered receptor-binding properties of the corresponding HA protein.","publish_time":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Wenjuan; Guo, Hongbo; Nijman, Vera S.; Doedt, Jennifer; van der Vries, Erhard; van der Lee, Joline; Li, Zeshi; Boons, Geert-Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

Such an approach can be achieved by taking into account clinical, pathological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics of the patients or an individual who has a suboptimal health condition. Inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, in this context, may diminish the predictive potential and slow down the development of PPPM and consequently modern healthcare.

MATERIAL/METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0\u20133). The chi-squared \u03C7(2) test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender. RESULTS: Study questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff. The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours. Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection. The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province. Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Haozheng; Tu, Baoren; Ma, Jing; Chen, Limin; Fu, Lei; Jiang, Yongfang; Zhuang, Quan","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dece1f5a5f1f6751920e40a9c855e0536c0e16be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291383/; https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hunan"],"keyphrases":["hospital staff","management of COVID","coping strategies of frontline medical staff","Hubei province","adjacent Hunan province","hospital management","reported cases of COVID","Study questionnaires","provision of infection control guidelines","specialized equipment","government","availability of strict infection control guidelines","psychological impact","psychological effects","safety","cross-sectional observational study","professional groups","psychological benefit","outbreak","responses","age-groups","professional obligation","recognition","increased stress","nurses","efforts","facilities","tracing contacts of patients","recent epidemic","doctors","families","reports of mortality","reduction","coronavirus disease","sections","METHODS","Continued acknowledgment","questions","China","MATERIAL","test","long hours","future epidemics","factors","chi-squared \u03C7","scores","gender","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Here, we studied GfCoV diversity and evaluated its phenotypic consequences. Over the period of 2014 to 2016, affected guinea fowl flocks were sampled in France, and avian coronavirus presence was confirmed by PCR on intestinal content and immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue. Sequencing revealed 89% amino acid identity between the viral attachment protein S1 of GfCoV/2014 and that of the previously identified GfCoV/2011. To study the receptor interactions as a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity, recombinant S1 proteins were produced and analyzed by glycan and tissue arrays. Glycan array analysis revealed that, in addition to the previously elucidated biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc) receptor, viral attachment S1 proteins from GfCoV/2014 and GfCoV/2011 can bind to glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, recombinant GfCoV/2014 S1 has an increased affinity for these glycans compared to that of GfCoV/2011 S1, which was in agreement with the increased avidity of GfCoV/2014 S1 for gastrointestinal tract tissues. Enzymatic removal of receptors from tissues before application of spike proteins confirmed the specificity of S1 tissue binding. Overall, we demonstrate that diversity in GfCoV S1 proteins results in differences in glycan and tissue binding properties. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses cause major global problems in the poultry industry. As causative agents of huge economic losses, the detection and understanding of the molecular determinants of viral tropism are of ultimate importance. Here, we set out to study those parameters and obtained in-depth insight into the virus-host interactions of guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV).

There are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co-infected patients including: expense, pill burden, toxicity, and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously. The anti-helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of Mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non-replicating M. abscessus was also recently described. Here we extend these findings to further demonstrate that niclosamide inhibits mycobacterial growth in infected human macrophages and mediates potent bacteriostatic activity against the virulent Mtb Beijing strain. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that niclosamide inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages and Jurkat T cells through post-integration effects on pro-virus transcription. The dual antiviral and anti-mycobacterial activity was further observed in an in vitro model of HIV and Mtb co-infection using human primary monocyte-derived macrophages.

We hypothesized that either exogenous treatment with oxytocin or the presence of the calf at first milking would lead to higher colostrum quantity and higher IgG concentration. The study was conducted from October to December 2017 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany. A total of 567 cows at the time of calving were enrolled, but for the final analyses only 521 animals were considered. The cows were randomly assigned on a daily basis into 1 of 3 groups: (1) control group (n = 177), (2) application of 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. (OXY; n = 163), and (3) presence of the calf (CA; n = 181) before and during milking. Cows in the control and oxytocin group had no contact with their calves after calving and were milked in a separate milking parlor. Cows in the oxytocin group were injected with 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. 3 min before manual stimulation. For cows in the third group, the calf was placed into a calf cart and located in front of the cow 3 min before manipulation of the cow. Colostrum quantity was determined by a digital hanging scale. The colostrum quality was assessed with digital Brix refractometry and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of 2 different treatment procedures, a generalized linear mixed model was constructed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM, Ehningen, Germany). The mean (\u00B1SE) colostrum quantity was 4.17 \u00B1 0.30 kg. The treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quantity. Parity, calf birth weight, and calving time affected colostrum quantity. Cows in second parity had the lowest quantity of colostrum (3.74 \u00B1 0.37 kg) compared with cows in parity 1 (4.75 \u00B1 0.34 kg) and cows in parity 3 or greater (4.75 \u00B1 0.38 kg). Cows calving during the night (2200 until 0600 h; 4.93 \u00B1 0.37 kg) had the highest quantity of colostrum compared with cows calving in the morning (0600 until 1400 h; 4.17 \u00B1 0.38 kg) or afternoon (1400 until 2200 h; 4.14 \u00B1 0.34 kg). Regarding colostrum quality, 48% of the colostrum samples contained \u226550 mg of IgG/mL. The mean IgG concentration was 54.6 \u00B1 2.80 mg of IgG/mL. Colostrum quality was affected by the treatment procedures, colostrum quantity, parity, calving time, harvesting time after calving, and the calving day during the week. Both treatment procedures (i.e., OXY with mean IgG concentration results of 57.0 mg of IgG/mL and CA with 56.0 mg of IgG/mL) resulted in higher IgG concentrations in colostrum compared with the control group (50.7 mg of IgG/mL). With increasing colostrum quantity, the colostrum quality decreased in primiparous and multiparous cows. A longer time lag between calving and milking negatively affected the colostrum quality. Concentration of IgG was higher for cows in parity 3 or greater (64.6 \u00B1 2.59 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows in parity 1 (48.5 \u00B1 2.86 mg of IgG/mL) and cows in parity 2 (50.7 \u00B1 2.89 mg of IgG/mL). Cows calving during the night had greater IgG concentrations (60.4 \u00B1 2.92 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows calving in the morning (51.9 \u00B1 2.98 mg of IgG/mL) or afternoon (51.3 \u00B1 2.71 mg of IgG/mL). Harvesting colostrum on quieter days, such as Sundays, resulted in higher IgG concentrations (61.4 \u00B1 3.70 mg of IgG/mL). The assessment by Brix refractometry resulted in a mean result of 26.0 \u00B1 0.20% Brix. Treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quality. A negative association was observed between colostrum quantity and quality in primiparous and multiparous cows determined by Brix refractometry. Brix readings were greater for cows in parity 3 or higher (27.7 \u00B1 0.26% Brix) compared with cows in parity 1 (25.3 \u00B1 0.30% Brix) and cows in parity 2 (25.0 \u00B1 0.32% Brix).

PATIENTS AND METHODS This 8-month prospective study of 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS in Taipei, Taiwan, was conducted from April through December 2003. RESULTS The most common presenting symptoms in our 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS were fever, dyspnea, dizziness, malaise, diarrhea, dry cough, muscle pain, and chills. Lymphopenia and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the most common initial laboratory findings. Initial chest radiographs revealed various pattern abnormalities and normal results. Five of the 14 patients required mechanical ventilation. The need for mechanical ventilation was associated with bilateral lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph and higher peak levels of LDH and CRP. Clinical severity of disease varied from mild to severe. At 8 months after disease onset, patients with mild or moderate SARS had normal findings or only focal fibrosis on chest high-resolution computed tomography. However, bilateral fibrotic changes remained in the 4 patients who had recovered from severe SARS, 1 of whom had mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. One patient with severe SARS died; she was elderly and had other comorbidities. Five additional patients had reduced diffusing capacity. CONCLUSION The clinical picture of our patients presenting with hospital-acquired SARS revealed atypical pneumonia associated with lymphopenia, elevated serum levels of LDH, rapid clinical deterioration, and lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy. Substantially elevated levels of LDH and CRP correlated with severe illness requiring mechanical ventilatory support. In those receiving mechanical ventilation, pulmonary function was only mildly reduced at 6 to 8 months after acute illness, consistent with the natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to other causes.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Chi-Huei; Shih, Jen-Fu; Su, Wei-Juin; Perng, Reury-Perng","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff07a6f4bac5525f4dfa9ad4b70e04b3c47ec878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094584.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619611621836; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611621836","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe SARS","additional patients","moderate SARS","elevated levels of LDH","severe illness","mechanical ventilation","clinical course of hospital","elevated serum levels of LDH","CRP","severe acute respiratory syndrome","clinical characteristics","clinical picture","Clinical severity of disease","higher peak levels of LDH","acute illness","Initial chest radiographs","rapid clinical deterioration","mechanical ventilatory support","elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase","Lymphopenia","normal findings","common initial laboratory findings","normal results","months","mild restrictive ventilatory impairment","natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome","common presenting symptoms","chest high-resolution computed tomography","disease onset","bilateral lung involvement","bilateral fibrotic changes","focal fibrosis","diarrhea","various pattern abnormalities","lack of response","dry cough","malaise","dizziness","atypical pneumonia","muscle pain","dyspnea","fever","month prospective study","C-reactive protein","empirical antibiotic therapy","METHODS","chills","causes","diffusing capacity","pulmonary function","Taipei","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","Taiwan","need","comorbidities"],"language":"en"},

Feline FV (FFV) has been isolated from domestic cats with concurrent diseases, including urinary syndromes. We experimentally infected five cats with FFV to study viral kinetics and tropism, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) phenotype, urinary parameters, and histopathology. A persistent infection of primarily lymphoid tropism was detected with no evidence of immunological or hematologic perturbations. One cat with a significant negative correlation between lymphocytes and PBMC proviral load displayed an expanded FFV tissue tropism. Significantly increased blood urea nitrogen and ultrastructural kidney changes were noted in all experimentally infected cats, though chemistry parameters were not outside of normal ranges. Histopathological changes were observed in the brain, large intestine, and other tissues. In order to determine if there is an association of FFV with Chronic Kidney Disease, we additionally screened 125 Australian pet cats with and without CKD for FFV infection and found that FFV is highly prevalent in older cats, particularly in males with CKD, though this difference was not statistically significant compared to controls.

Many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and diphtheria) are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs. Nonetheless, vaccine manufacturing remains incredibly challenging. Viruses exhibiting high antigenic diversity and high mutation rates cannot be fairly contested using traditional vaccine production methods and complexities surrounding the manufacturing processes, which impose significant limitations. Virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) are recombinantly produced viral structures that exhibit immunoprotective traits of native viruses but are noninfectious. Several VLPs that compositionally match a given natural virus have been developed and licensed as vaccines. Expansively, a plethora of studies now confirms that VLPs can be designed to safely present heterologous antigens from a variety of pathogens unrelated to the chosen carrier VLPs. Owing to this design versatility, VLPs offer technological opportunities to modernize vaccine supply and disease response through rational bioengineering. These opportunities are greatly enhanced with the application of synthetic biology, the redesign and construction of novel biological entities. This review outlines how synthetic biology is currently applied to engineer VLP functions and manufacturing process. Current and developing technologies for the identification of novel target\u2010specific antigens and their usefulness for rational engineering of VLP functions (e.g., presentation of structurally diverse antigens, enhanced antigen immunogenicity, and improved vaccine stability) are described. When applied to manufacturing processes, synthetic biology approaches can also overcome specific challenges in VLP vaccine production. Finally, we address several challenges and benefits associated with the translation of VLP vaccine development into the industry.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charlton Hume, Hayley K.; Vidigal, Jo\u00E3o; Carrondo, Manuel J.

The research in the field of therapeutic peptides began to develop extensively in the second half of the 20(th) century. Since then, the mechanisms of action for several peptides and their antiviral prospect received large attention due to the global threat posed by viruses. Here, we discussed the therapeutic properties of peptides used in influenza treatment. Peptides with antiviral activity against influenza can be divided into three main groups. First, entry blocker peptides such as a Flupep that interact with influenza hemagglutinin, block its binding to host cells and prevent viral fusion. Second, several peptides display virucidal activity, disrupting viral envelopes, e.g., Melittin. Finally, a third set of peptides interacts with the viral polymerase complex and act as viral replication inhibitors such as PB1 derived peptides. Here, we present a review of the current literature describing the antiviral activity, mechanism and future therapeutic potential of these influenza antiviral peptides.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skalickova, Sylvie; Heger, Zbynek; Krejcova, Ludmila; Pekarik, Vladimir; Bastl, Karel; Janda, Jozef; Kostolansky, Frantisek; Vareckova, Eva; Zitka, Ondrej; Adam, Vojtech; Kizek, Rene","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f44e4d806117b957383a7ee870d2dd38213f094.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632391.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza antiviral peptides","set of peptides","antiviral activity","therapeutic properties of peptides","field of therapeutic peptides","influenza hemagglutinin","influenza treatment","PB1 derived peptides","entry blocker peptides","antiviral therapy","antiviral prospect","resistant influenza strains","worldwide influenza pandemic","virulent avian influenza strains","available antiviral drugs","viral envelopes","viral fusion","viral replication inhibitors","viral polymerase complex","virucidal activity","future therapeutic potential","global threat","increased frequency of drug","urgent development of new strategies","emergence","large attention","binding","Flupep","host cells","current literature","past decade","research","mechanisms of action","review","viruses","Melittin","main groups","half","century"],"language":"en"},

To provide insight into the understanding of the phylogenetic and the current epidemiological status of PEDV, PEDV HLJBY was compared with CV777 and other PEDV strains deposited in the GenBank. The homology between the entire genomic nucleotide sequences of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%. The homology of M gene was the highest (99.0%). However, the homology of ORF3 gene was 97.7%, and protein of ORF3 was 90.1%. In addition, HLJBY showed the highest nucleotide identity (99.9%) with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain and lowest similarity (91.2%) to PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. We analysed the changes in S gene and its protein of PEDV HLJBY with 65 historic PEDV strains. The highest nucleotide identity was 99.9% compared with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain, and the lowest nucleotide identity was 60.0% compared with PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. The length of deduced amino acid sequences of S proteins varied from 1,372 to 1,390 amino acids (aa). Compared with most aa sequences of S proteins, HLJBY exhibited 5 aa deletions (position 55, 59\u201361, 144). Analysis and comparison of open reading frame 3 (ORF3) proteins between HLJBY strain and other PEDV strains were also focused in this study. We revealed that the length of deduced amino acid sequences of ORF3 proteins was 80\u2013224 aa among tested strains and the identity of HLJBY ORF3 amino acids with other PEDV strains was 71.4%\u201398.9%. ORF3 protein of both HLJBY strain and PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain consists of 91 aa, with 133 aa deletions at their C\u0027 end in relation to the other tested PEDV strains.

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of sialic acid binding for the infection of cultured cells under unfavorable conditions, and comparison of TGEV strains and mutants, as well as the avian coronavirus IBV concerning their dependence on the sialic acid binding activity. METHODS: The infectivity of different viruses was analyzed by a plaque assay after adsorption times of 5, 20, and 60 min. Prior to infection, cultured cells were either treated with neuraminidase to deplete sialic acids from the cell surface, or mock-treated. In a second approach, pre-treatment of the virus with porcine intestinal mucin was performed, followed by the plaque assay after a 5 min adsorption time. A student\u0027s t-test was used to verify the significance of the results. RESULTS: Desialylation of cells only had a minor effect on the infection by TGEV strain Purdue 46 when an adsorption period of 60 min was allowed for initiation of infection. However, when the adsorption time was reduced to 5 min the infectivity on desialylated cells decreased by more than 60%. A TGEV PUR46 mutant (HAD3) deficient in sialic acid binding showed a 77% lower titer than the parental virus after a 5 min adsorption time. After an adsorption time of 60 min the titer of HAD3 was 58% lower than that of TGEV PUR46. Another TGEV strain, TGEV Miller, and IBV Beaudette showed a reduction in infectivity after neuraminidase treatment of the cultured cells irrespective of the virion adsorption time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the sialic acid binding activity facilitates the infection by TGEV under unfavorable environmental conditions. The dependence on the sialic acid binding activity for an efficient infection differs in the analyzed TGEV strains.","publish_time":"2011-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwegmann-We\u00DFels, Christel; Bauer, Sandra; Winter, Christine; Enjuanes, Luis; Laude, Hubert; Herrler, Georg","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7902723eb8b21baa5eef8703832de11cc242a43b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3184106.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21910859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","IBV Beaudette"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sialic acid binding activity","infection of cultured cells","effect of sialic acid binding","TGEV Miller","analyzed TGEV strains","virion adsorption time","efficient infection","TGEV strain Purdue","comparison of TGEV strains","sialic acids","TGEV PUR46 mutant","initiation of infection","adsorption period","adsorption times","Desialylation of cells","desialylated cells","results","dependence","unfavorable conditions","parental virus","lower titer","titer of HAD3","plaque assay","unfavorable environmental conditions","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","infectivity of different viruses","IBV Beaudette","neuraminidase treatment","minor effect","avian coronavirus IBV","reduction","pre-treatment","cell surface","mutants","BACKGROUND","porcine intestinal mucin","METHODS","student\u0027s t-test","mock","study","significance","approach","aims","enteropathogenicity","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

There has been an outbreak of PDCoV in worldwide since 2014, causing significant economic losses in the pig industry. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response is an important component of virus-host interactions and plays an essential role in inhibiting virus infection. However, the mechanism of PDCoV escaping the porcine immune surveillance is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein antagonizes porcine IFN-\u03B2 production after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection or poly(I:C) stimulation. PDCoV N protein also suppressed the activation of porcine IFN-\u03B2 promoter when it was stimulated by porcine RLR signaling molecules. PDCoV N protein targeted porcine retinoic acid-inducible gene I (pRIG-I) and porcine TNF receptor associated factor 3 (pTRAF3) by directly interacting with them. The N-terminal region (1\u2013246 aa) of PDCoV N protein was important for interacting with pRIG-I and interfere its function. We confirmed that PDCoV N antagonizes IFN-\u03B2 production by associating with pRIG-I to impede it from binding double-stranded RNA. Furthermore, porcine Riplet (pRiplet) was an important activator for pRIG-I by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, PDCoV N protein restrained the pRiplet binding pRIG-I to inhibit pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism by which PDCoV N protein interferes with the early activation of pRIG-I in the host antiviral response. The novel findings provide a new insight into PDCoV on evading the host innate immune response and may provide new therapeutic targets and more efficacious vaccines strategies for PDCoV infections.","publish_time":"2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Likai, Ji; Shasha, Li; Wenxian, Zhu; Jingjiao, Ma; Jianhe, Sun; Hengan, Wang; Yaxian, Yan","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f93195034f642c748faae11cb58300881eb7b2bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6521028.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV N protein","mechanism of PDCoV","PDCoV infections","PDCoV nucleocapsid","outbreak of PDCoV","porcine Riplet","porcine RLR","Porcine deltacoronavirus","porcine IFN-\u03B2 production","porcine immune surveillance","activation of porcine IFN-\u03B2 promoter","detected porcine coronavirus","porcine TNF receptor","pRiplet binding pRIG","early activation of pRIG","N-terminal region","host antiviral response","porcine retinoic acid-inducible gene","immune response","important component of virus","inhibiting virus infection","host interactions","important activator","novel mechanism","K63-linked polyubiquitination","vesicular stomatitis virus","new insight","novel findings","newborn piglets","new therapeutic targets","binding double-stranded RNA","diarrhea","efficacious vaccines strategies","VSV","serious vomiting","essential role","significant economic losses","pig industry","factor","pTRAF3","stimulation","results","molecules","interferon","present study","function"],"language":"en"},

Demeanor of calves with diarrhea is associated with acidemia, dehydration, and hyper\u2010d\u2010lactatemia. HYPOTHESIS: Unmeasured anions are a major factor influencing changes in plasma pH and HCO (3) (\u2212) of calves with diarrhea and UAs and strong UAs, estimated by anion gap (AG) and strong ion gap (SIG), respectively, are more strongly associated with alteration of demeanor compared to other acid\u2013base variables. ANIMALS: A total of 264 calves with diarrhea from two data sets (DS1 and DS2). METHODS: Retrospective study. Forward stepwise regression was performed to determine the relationship between measured pH or HCO (3) (\u2212), and physicochemical variables. A two\u2010way ANOVA was performed to investigate the association between acid\u2013base variables and attitude (bright, obtunded, and stuporous), posture (standing, sternal or lateral recumbency), and strength of suckling reflex (strong, weak, or absent). RESULTS: Increased strong UAs estimated by SIG was the most important contributor to changes in measured pH and HCO (3) (\u2212) (DS1: r (2) 66 and 59%, DS2: 39 and 42%, P \u003C .0001). SIG and AG were correlated to deteriorating calf demeanor for all three clinical scoring categories: attitude, posture, and suckle reflex (P \u003C .0001). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Elevated concentrations of strong UAs were the primary cause of acidemia and had an important influence on the demeanor of calves with diarrhea. These findings emphasize the importance of the calculation of UAs when evaluating acid\u2013base abnormalities in calves.","publish_time":"2013-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomez, D.E.; Lofstedt, J.; St\u00E4mpfli, H.R.; Wichtel, M.; Muirhead, T.; McClure, J.T.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e592504c0b73ab046f2e32aa0bd3f3c52a28f661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.12193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Demeanor of calves","Increased strong UAs","diarrhea","HCO","Elevated concentrations of strong UAs","calculation of UAs","plasma pH","strong ion gap","measured pH","base variables","SIG","calf demeanor","alteration of demeanor","physicochemical variables","quantitative effect of strong electrolytes","unmeasured anions","plasma protein concentrations","posture","attitude","AG","base abnormalities","changes","DS1","DS2","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","anion gap","important contributor","important influence","physicochemical approach","clinical scoring categories","primary cause of acidemia","strength of suckling reflex","major factor","dehydration","data sets","lateral recumbency","hyper\u2010d","CONCLUSION","association","relationship","bicarbonate","lactatemia","HYPOTHESIS","importance","BACKGROUND","total","RESULTS","METHODS","Retrospective study","findings","ANIMALS","two\u2010way ANOVA","stepwise regression"],"language":"en"},

Twenty-five (66%) and 27 (71%) of 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14 had evidence of infection by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one of 4 days investigated after virus challenge. In contrast, only 14 of 38 (37%) volunteers had significant antibody rises as detected by the neutralization test. Of the 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14, only 13 (34%) had symptoms of colds. Of these, 12 (92%) and 10 (77%) were positive by virus isolation or ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Six (46%) had significant antibody rises by neutralization. Similarly, of the 38 volunteers challenged, 22 (58%) were asymptomatic and of these 10 (45.5%) and 12 (54.5%) were positive by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Only 8 (36.4%) of these asymptomatic volunteers showed significant antibody rises by neutralization. There were significant associations between the detection of rhinoviruses by ISH and virus isolation on the third day (P\u003C0.025) after virus challenge in the group as a whole and in the symptomatic group. These results show that generally rhinovirus detection by ISH compares well with virus isolation and both tests are clearly more sensitive than the neutralization test in detecting evidence of infection. It is concluded that ISH is an interesting new technique that may play an important role in the study of rhinovirus infection and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"1990-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruce, Christine; Chadwick, Patricia; Al-Nakib, Widad","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bcf694e78273c15d4b4df43f143097a3977d54f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016609349090049L; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016609349090049L","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISH","virus isolation","virus challenge","asymptomatic volunteers","rhinovirus detection","significant antibody","neutralization test","HRV","study of rhinovirus infection","nasal washings of volunteers","human rhinovirus","evidence of infection","significant associations","detection of rhinoviruses","symptomatic group","evaluation","important role","cells","situ hybridization","development","interesting new technique","pathogenesis","tests","paper","days","results","symptoms of colds","contrast"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via cell receptor ACE II (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). In order to identify possible prime target cells of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive dissection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression pattern in different cell types, five datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric mucosa, ileum and colon were analysed. DESIGN: Five datasets were searched, separately integrated and analysed. Violin plot was used to show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for different clusters. The ACE2-expressing and TMPRRSS2-expressing cells were highlighted and dissected to characterise the composition and proportion. RESULTS: Cell types in each dataset were identified by known markers. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not only coexpressed in lung AT2 cells and oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells but also highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. Additionally, among all the coexpressing cells in the normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in the ileum and colon. CONCLUSION: This study provides the evidence of the potential route of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive system along with the respiratory tract based on single-cell transcriptomic analysis. This finding may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study also demonstrates a novel method to identify the prime cell types of a virus by the coexpression pattern analysis of single-cell sequencing data.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hao; Kang, Zijian; Gong, Haiyi; Xu, Da; Wang, Jing; Li, Zhixiu; Li, Zifu; Cui, Xinggang; Xiao, Jianru; Zhan, Jian; Meng, Tong; Zhou, Wang; Liu, Jianmin; Xu, Huji","journal":"Gut","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a2d6dc90bbe1b549a34610c6900c52827d7f8c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211082.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320953","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","prime cell types","different cell types","single-cell transcriptomes of lung","host cells","gland cells","coexpressing cells","lung AT2 cells","single-cell transcriptomic analysis","cell receptor ACE","cell sequencing data","possible prime target cells of SARS","prevention of SARS","expression of ACE2","ileum","colon","TMPRSS2 coexpression pattern","potential route of SARS","comprehensive dissection of ACE2","coexpression pattern analysis of single","identified coronavirus","datasets","study","normal digestive system","respiratory tract","different clusters","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","oesophagus","health policy setting","gastric mucosa","significant impact","evidence","novel method","order","transmembrane serine protease","absorptive enterocytes","outbreaks of pneumonia","Wuhan","China","distribution","genes","RESULTS","finding","CONCLUSION","infection","TMPRRSS2","Violin plot","composition","proportion","markers","DESIGN","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score \u003C 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth \u003C 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth \u003C 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, \u003E90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Mascio, Daniele; Khalil, Asma; Saccone, Gabriele; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Buca, Danilo; Liberati, Marco; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Nappi, Luigi; Scambia, Giovanni; Berghella, Vincenzo; D\u2019Antonio, Francesco","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee2254bc1c223852d30fe7d8fcf44dee6c8dd854.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933320300379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933320300379?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinicaltrials.gov","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","pregnancy outcomes","rate of perinatal death","perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus","common adverse pregnancy outcome","rate of preterm birth","coronavirus infections","SARS-COV","rate of miscarriage","CoV infections","MERS","preterm prelabor rupture of membranes","common symptoms","fetal growth restriction","published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission","neonatal intensive care unit","clinical signs of vertical transmission","Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria","pregnant women","neonatal asphyxia","selection criteria","fetal distress","systematic review","spectrum infections","Study appraisal","cesarean","newborns","weeks","preeclampsia","confirmed Coronavirus related illness","premature prelabor rupture of membranes","prenatal counseling of women","Data sources Medline","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","pooled proportions","meta-analyses of proportions","overt diagnosis of pneumonia","pre-eclampsia","admission","synthesis methods","Embase","Cinahl","minutes","Apgar score","aim","PTB","ABSTRACT Objective","mode of delivery","combinations of word variants","databases","studies","English language","fever","Conclusion","mothers","disease","cough","Results","search","general population","pregnancies","dyspnea","findings"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical severity of viral co-infections as compared to single viral respiratory infections. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and other sources for studies published up to January 28, 2013. We included observational studies on inpatients with respiratory illnesses comparing the clinical severity of viral co-infections to single viral infections as detected by molecular assays. The primary outcome reflecting clinical disease severity was length of hospital stay (LOS). A random-effects model was used to conduct the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 4,280 patients were included. The overall quality of evidence applying the GRADE approach ranged from moderate for oxygen requirements to low for all other outcomes. No significant differences in length of hospital stay (LOS) (mean difference (MD) \u22120.20 days, 95% CI \u22120.94, 0.53, p = 0.59), or mortality (RR 2.44, 95% CI 0.86, 6.91, p = 0.09) were documented in subjects with viral co-infections compared to those with a single viral infection.

In this study we profiled 372 cancer-associated miRNAs in plasma collected before (~60% patients) and after/during commencement of treatment (~40% patients), from age-matched prostate cancer patients and healthy controls, and observed elevated levels of 4 miRNAs - miR-4289, miR-326, miR-152-3p and miR-98-5p, which were validated in an independent cohort. The miRNA panel was able to differentiate between prostate cancer patients and controls (AUC = 0.88). Analysis of published miRNA transcriptomic data from clinical samples demonstrated low expression of miR-152-3p in tumour compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues. Overexpression of miR-152-3p increased proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells, suggesting a role for this miRNA in prostate cancer pathogenesis, a concept that was supported by pathway analysis of predicted miR-152-3p target genes. In summary, a four miRNA panel, including miR-152-3p which likely targets genes with key roles in prostate cancer pathogenesis, has the potential to improve early prostate cancer diagnosis.","publish_time":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matin, Farhana; Jeet, Varinder; Moya, Leire; Selth, Luke A.; Chambers, Suzanne; Clements, Judith A.; Batra, Jyotsna","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/247d7378386c4c48cf327c151a9ea73040df0403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703916/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24424-w","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prostate cancer pathogenesis","early prostate cancer diagnosis","miRNAs - miR","migration of prostate cancer cells","age-matched prostate cancer patients","cancer-associated miRNAs","improved clinical management of prostate cancer patients","Overexpression of miR","identification of significant cancer","low expression of miR","p target genes","pathway analysis of predicted miR","miRNA panel","p increased proliferation","Analysis of published miRNA transcriptomic data","clinical samples","reliable early diagnostic biomarkers","healthy controls","current diagnostic modalities","likely targets genes","key roles","potential","important cellular processes","elevated levels","concept","year","tumour","pathways","AUC","adjacent non-malignant tissues","MicroRNAs","plasma","body fluids","commencement of treatment","study","summary","independent cohort"],"language":"en"},

In an effort to expand the number of possible ways to uniquely and efficiently encode unnatural amino acids, we have devised a general strategy to select tRNAs with the ability to suppress four-base codons from a library of tRNAs with randomized 8 or 9 nt anticodon loops. Our selectants included both known and novel suppressible four-base codons and resulted in a set of very efficient, non-cross-reactive tRNA/four-base codon pairs for AGGA, UAGA, CCCU and CUAG. The most efficient four-base codon suppressors had Watson-Crick complementary anticodons, and the sequences of the anticodon loops outside of the anticodons varied with the anticodon. Additionally, four-base codon reporter libraries were used to identify \u201Cshifty\u201D sites at which \u002B1 frameshifting is most favorable in the absence of suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli. We intend to use these tRNAs to explore the limits of unnatural polypeptide biosynthesis, both in vitro and eventually in vivo.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has recently emerged in East Asia and North America. Although the clinical features of acute infection have been well described, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections have not been well characterized. Objective. To assess the spectrum of illness in health-care workers (HCWs). Methods. A prospective seroepidemiologic cohort study was conducted on 372 HCWs in a large teaching hospital in Singapore who were both exposed and not exposed to patients with SARS. Participating HCWs completed a questionnaire and provided paired serum samples, which were analyzed by 2 different laboratories blinded to clinical data, by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on a protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a dot-blot immunoassay, with confirmation by a viral neutralization assay. Results. A total of 21 patients with SARS were treated at our hospital. They were associated with transmission to 14 staff members, patients, and visitors in our hospital. Of the 372 HCWs participating in the present study, 8 were found to have positive antibodies to the SARS coronavirus in both samples by use of both test methods, and 6 had pneumonia and had been hospitalized for either probable or suspected SARS infection, whereas 2 had fever but did not have changes on chest radiographs. All seropositive HCWs had been exposed either directly or indirectly to patients with SARS. No asymptomatic, nonexposed staff members were found to be seropositive. There was a trend towards protection for HCWs who, while fully protected, had had contact with patients with SARS. Conclusions. Although the majority of cases of SARS are associated with pneumonia, a small number of mildly symptomatic individuals do seroconvert. HCWs who are exposed to patients with SARS can be infected with SARS, regardless of the intensity of exposure. This has implications for surveillance and infection control planning, in the event that SARS returns next winter.","publish_time":"2004-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Khek Y.; Singh, Kamaljit S.; Habib, Abdulrazaq G.; Ong, Benjamin K.; Lim, Tow K.; Ooi, Eng E.; Sil, Bijon K.; Ling, Ai-Ee; Bai, Xin L.; Tambyah, Paul A.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a57cae0aa947c4e3fcfa5c395a02981470636ef7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["East Asia","North America","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","patients","suspected SARS infection","seropositive HCWs","Participating HCWs","use","infection control planning","Disease Control","clinical features of acute infection","pneumonia","nonexposed staff members","large teaching hospital","clinical data","symptomatic individuals","test methods","present study","asymptomatic infections","paired serum samples","viral neutralization assay","recognized infectious disease","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","prospective seroepidemiologic cohort study","confirmation","Prevention","dot-blot immunoassay","protocol","questionnaire","health-care workers","small number","Centers","implications","surveillance","Singapore","visitors","spectrum of illness","East Asia","changes","North America","different laboratories","positive antibodies","fever","transmission","majority of cases","chest radiographs","trend","protection","winter","total","contact","intensity of exposure","Background","Objective","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays were conducted to evaluate the attractiveness of synthetic aggregation pheromone lure to lesser mealworm adults and larvae. All components of this synthetic aggregation pheromone lure, including: (R)-(\u002B)-limonene, (E)-\u03B2-ocimene, (S)-(\u002B)-linalool, (R)-(\u002B)-daucene, and 2-nonanone were also tested singly. Chicken dropping volatile compounds and fresh chicken droppings (CD) were evaluated singly or in combination with the pheromone lure. In Arkansas, trapping experiments were conducted in different poultry houses with low, moderate, and high lesser mealworm populations to evaluate the attraction of pheromone lure. Laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassay was found to be a useful and convenient tool for evaluating the attractants before testing them in the poultry house. Greater attraction of adults and larvae to a dose of 20\u201330 \u03BCg pheromone lure was identified in laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays. Adults and larvae were highly attractive to a combination of fresh CD and pheromone lure, whereas, a combination of chicken dropping volatile and pheromone lure was not significantly attractive. The low attraction of limonene and linalool in the laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays suggest that either they are nonattractive or attractive only at a narrow range of concentrations. Higher numbers of lesser mealworm adults and larvae were found in traps treated with pheromone lure as compared with untreated controls in field experiments. Results indicate a potential for combining the pheromone lure with the attractive CD compounds to enhance trap efficacy.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, N.; Johnson, D.

In Canada, investigations of zoonotic disease incidents are often conducted by public health inspectors (PHIs). However, little is known about PHIs\u0027 knowledge of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, their perceptions of zoonotic disease importance or their education regarding zoonotic diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perceptions and education of Canadian PHIs regarding zoonotic diseases. Data were collected from December 2008\u2013January 2009 using an internet\u2010based survey distributed to members of the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors national listserv. Responses were received from 229 PHIs in four provinces, with a response rate of approximately 20%. The majority of respondents reported at least 10 years of experience in the public health sector, 80% (181/225) were in frontline positions, and 62% (137/222) were routinely involved in investigations of infectious diseases. Two\u2010thirds believed that the importance of zoonotic diseases with regards to public health would increase in the next 5 years. Whilst most respondents were able to correctly identify animals capable of directly transmitting common zoonotic pathogens, there were gaps in knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by companion animals. PHIs tended to feel that their training on zoonotic diseases prior to working as PHIs was deficient in some areas, or left some room for improvement. Their responses also suggested that there is a need for improvement in both the quantity and the quality of continuing education on zoonotic diseases. In particular, less than one\u2010third of PHIs received ongoing continuing education regarding zoonotic diseases, and of those that did, nearly two\u2010thirds rated the quantity and quality as only fair.","publish_time":"2012-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snedeker, K.

The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-\u0394E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-\u0394E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells. The infectious virus was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the E protein in trans, indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective. Therefore, the rMERS-CoV-\u0394E mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2012, it has already spread to 10 different countries, infecting around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50%. This article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, based on the construction of an infectious cDNA clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using this system, a collection of rMERS-CoV deletion mutants has been generated. Interestingly, one of the mutants with the E gene deleted was a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing E protein in trans, whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo. This virus constitutes a vaccine candidate that may represent a balance between safety and efficacy for the induction of mucosal immunity, which is needed to prevent MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2013-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; DeDiego, Marta L.; Sola, Isabel; Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Marquez-Jurado, Silvia; Andr\u00E9s, German; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71b1e5b3dcbccd130699fbbdbc537a66a24598bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3774192.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00650-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023385/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV replication","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV genome","infectious virus","\u0394E mutant virus","CoV deletion mutants","engineered mutant virus","propagation-defective virus","emergence of MERS","wild-type virus","single virus infection cycle","Recombinant MERS-CoVs","full-length infectious cDNA clone","rMERS-CoVs","collection of rMERS","cDNA clones","cells","structural E protein","mutant viruses","\u0394E genome","replication competent","replication-competent","accessory genes","reverse genetics system","promising vaccine candidate","bacterial artificial chromosome","propagation defective","construction","vaccine candidates","high mortality rate","mortality rate higher","emerging coronavirus infecting humans","attenuated viruses","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","occasional renal failure","acute pneumonia","efficacy","persons","growth kinetics similar","molecular biology","threat","balance","development","Arabian Peninsula","cell cultures","induction of mucosal immunity","Vero A66","viral infectivity","early passages","safety","contrast","laboratory","transfection","public health","different countries","summer","IMPORTANCE","article"],"language":"en"},

Value-added annotations are provided for key proteins from experimental findings using controlled vocabulary. The availability of pathogen and host omics data in an integrated framework allows global analysis of the data and comparisons across different experiments and organisms, as illustrated in several case studies presented here. (1) The identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and human HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggesting that this protein can be prioritized for additional analysis and functional characterization. (2) The analysis of a vaccinia-human protein interaction network supplemented with protein accumulation levels led to the identification of human Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 protein as a potential therapeutic target. (3) Comparison of complete genomes from pathogenic variants coupled with experimental information on complete proteomes allowed the identification and prioritization of ten potential diagnostic targets from Bacillus anthracis. The integrative analysis across data sets from multiple centers can reveal potential functional significance and hidden relationships between pathogen and host proteins, thereby providing a systems approach to basic understanding of pathogenicity and target identification.","publish_time":"2009-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGarvey, Peter B.; Huang, Hongzhan; Mazumder, Raja; Zhang, Jian; Chen, Yongxing; Zhang, Chengdong; Cammer, Stephen; Will, Rebecca; Odle, Margie; Sobral, Bruno; Moore, Margaret; Wu, Cathy H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/561bde3336a2cd2006251effb54e5428c4edf3b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2745575.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19779614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["NIAID","Proteomics Research Centers"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein interactions","protein expressions","protein structures","comprehensive protein","hypothetical protein","host data","protein-centric approach","protein accumulation levels","host omics data","data sets","data warehouse","heterogeneous data","vaccinia-human protein interaction network","host proteins","host systems","global analysis","target identification","integrative analysis","additional analysis","identification of human Keratin","potential vaccines","systems approach","potential functional significance","potential diagnostic targets","potential therapeutic target","availability of pathogen","Bacillus anthracis","Biodefense Proteomics program","viral pathogens","human HeLa cells","diverse types of pathogen","Proteomics Research Centers","multiple centers","key proteins","gene identifier","differential gene","experimental information","experimental findings","integrated framework","complete proteomes","different experiments","functional characterization","bioinformatics framework","Value-added annotations","Comparison of complete genomes","Biodefense Resource Center","microarray transcriptional profiles","Allergy","Infectious Diseases","mass spectrometry","hidden relationships","pathogenic variants","Salmonella typhimurium","mouse macrophage","diagnostics","comparisons","basic understanding of pathogenicity","prioritization","National Institute","bioterrorism","therapeutics","support mining","orthopox","controlled vocabulary","biological reagents","agents of concern","organisms","mappings","NIAID"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the molecular mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in regulation of the proinflammatory factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Individual viral proteins were tested for their abilities to regulate COX-2 gene expression. Results showed that the COX-2 promoter was activated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that N protein was sufficient to stimulate the production of COX-2 protein in mammalian cells. COX-2 promoter mutations suggested that activation of COX-2 transcription depended on two regulatory elements, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) binding site, and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein bound directly to these regulatory sequences. Protein mutation analysis revealed that a Lys-rich motif of N protein acted as a nuclear localization signal and was essential for the activation of COX-2. In addition, a Leu-rich motif was found to be required for the N protein function. A sequence of 68 residuals was identified as a potential DNA-binding domain essential for activating COX-2 expression. We propose that SARS-CoV N protein causes inflammation of the lungs by activating COX-2 gene expression by binding directly to the promoter resulting in inflammation through multiple COX-2 signaling cascades.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Xiaohong; Hao, Qian; Mu, Yongxin; Timani, Khalid Amine; Ye, Linbai; Zhu, Ying; Wu, Jianguo","journal":"The International Journal of Biochemistry \u0026 Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8666c2951c9dbce6767eb927174cbeadca9290c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108415.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272506000501; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272506000501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of COX","multiple COX","production of COX","N protein function","enhancer binding protein","SARS-CoV N protein causes inflammation","Protein mutation analysis","Lys-rich motif of N protein","binding site","CoV proteins","roles of SARS","gene expression","lungs","potential DNA-binding domain essential","Abstract SARS-associated coronavirus","promoter mutations","Leu-rich motif","nuclear factor-kappa B","proinflammatory factor","regulatory elements","regulatory sequences","nuclear localization signal","Western blot analysis","Individual viral proteins","EMSA","NF-\u03BAB","regulation","CCAAT","EBP","chromatin immunoprecipitation","ChIP","Electrophoretic mobility shift assay","severe acute respiratory syndrome","cyclooxygenase","damage","abilities","transcription","concentration-dependent manner","event","residuals","addition","mammalian cells","nucleocapsid","molecular mechanisms","cascades","Results"],"language":"en"},

This review aims to provide a critical overview regarding the deactivation of sludge-associated pathogens by AD, through which a serious concern on the effectiveness and rationality of AD towards sludge pathogens control was raised. Meanwhile, the underlying deactivation mechanisms and affecting factors were all discussed, with the focus on pathogen-associated modeling, engineering design and technological aspects of AD. Lastly, a matric method incorporating the operating strategy of AD with the risk assessment was proposed for evaluating the reliability of AD-based pathogen deactivation, while the research agenda forward was also outlined.","publish_time":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Qian; Liu, Yu","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba1ab411e62b278e72259c8203b76991c3efbc7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112049.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971931040X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870755/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896971931040X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated pathogens","deactivation of sludge","rationality of AD","sludge pathogens control","reliability of AD","spread of pathogens","viable pathogens","operating strategy of AD","based pathogen deactivation","pathogen-associated modeling","underlying deactivation mechanisms","direct discharge of sewage sludge","serious challenge","managed sanitation","serious concern","public health","matric method","municipal wastewater treatment plants","World Health Organization advocates","principal method of stabilizing biosolids","global burden of sanitation related disease","various agricultural applications","engineering design","access","technological aspects of","virus","effectiveness","Abstract","environment","risk assessment","critical overview","parasite","research agenda","antibiotic resistance genes","factors","focus","Anaerobic digestion","review"],"language":"en"},

The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. OBJECTIVE: Compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. METHODS: A 3-year period observational study (2012\u20132015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. RESULTS: The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85.5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35.5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support. DISCUSSION: Our study showed a significant proportion of viral coinfections in young infants admitted with LRTI and confirmed previous data showing that prescription was more frequent in inpatients with viral coinfections, without an association with worst clinical outcome.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gil, Joana; Almeida, Sofia; Constant, Carolina; Pinto, Sara; Barreto, Ros\u00E1rio; Melo Cristino, Jos\u00E9; Machado, Maria do C\u00E9u; Bandeira, Teresa","journal":"An Pediatr (Engl Ed)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/303063235dc128b3aa37530cdd4dfb20f0fd56b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185650.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363218/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287917300893; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2017.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2341287917300893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","RSV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relevance of viral coinfections","Viral identification","significant proportion of viral coinfections","unknown viral agents","Viral coinfection group","LRTI","identified virus","single virus infection","Clinical data","clinical presentation","frequent diagnosis","previous data","worst clinical outcome","oxygen need","molecular diagnosis","year period observational study","children younger","longer length of hospital","previous recurrent wheezing","causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections","severity","day-care centers","young infants","ICU","standard collection form","bronchiolitis","pneumonia","association","complementary exams","PCR technique","prescription","health resources","inpatients","prescribed medications","INTRODUCTION","Advances","ventilatory support","OBJECTIVE","HRV","years","samples","frequency","METHODS","viruses","RESULTS","DISCUSSION","admission","RSV"],"language":"en"},

Cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults. Exposure among Serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an ELISA. Application of RT-PCR to 27 fecal samples revealed viral RNA in three samples (11%). All three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals (\u003C24 months of age) sampled, and none from the 12 adults sampled. No viral RNA was detected in tissue samples (lymph node, intestine, lung) from 11 individuals. Sequencing of two amplified products from the S protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific RNA with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type II of 80 and 84%, respectively. Estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in European, American and Japanese domestic cats and dogs. From long-term observations of several hundred known individuals, the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea. There was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas.

The study concludes that maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for patients while COVID-19 is being treated may be rational.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahzad, Farrukh; Shahzad, Umer; Fareed, Zeeshan; Iqbal, Najaf; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider; Ahmad, Fayyaz","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326322?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326322; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sim \u0026 Zhou"],"locations":["China","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["number of COVID","Daily COVID","temperature quantities","temperature data","different quantiles of COVID","provinces Guangdong","Shandong provinces","affected provinces","asymmetrical effect of temperature","present study","differences","Chinese National Health Commission","Weather Underground Company","official websites","Henan","Jiangxi","Heilongjiang","Anhui","Jiangsu","WUC","province\u0027s overall hospital facilitations","Zhejiang","comfortable atmosphere","patients","approach","Zhou","relationship","cases","Hubei","Hunan","QQ","Sim","Coronavirus Disease","mixed trends","Empirical results","China"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled study, we enrolled hospitalized adults diagnosed with LRTI. Patients were randomized to an intervention group (POCT FilmArray Panel for 20 viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria plus routine real-time PCR) or a control group (routine real-time PCR for ten pathogens). The primary outcome was duration of intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization. The secondary outcomes included length of stay, cost of hospitalization and de-escalation within 72 hours and between 72 hours and 7 days. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. RESULTS: Between October 2017 and July 2018, we enrolled 800 eligible patients (398 in the intervention group and 402 in the control group). Duration of intravenous antibiotics in the intervention group was shorter than in the control (7.0 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0\u20139.0) versus 8.0 days (IQR 6.0\u201311.0); p \u003C0.001).

METHODS: Fusion peptides of several enveloped viruses belonging to different virus families were prepared by standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl polyamine solid-phase synthesis and used to stimulate U937 cells in vitro to analyze the phosphorylation patterns of the signaling pathways (PKC, Src, Akt, and MAPK pathways). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out by using phosphospecific antibodies. All samples were also assayed for the presence of IL-10 and IFN-\u03B2 by ELISA and activation of nuclear factors (AP-1 and NF-\u03BAB). RESULTS: We have demonstrated that hydrophobic domains of fusion proteins are able to induce several transduction pathways that lead to cytokine (IFN-\u03B2 and IL-10) production, an event that appears to be dependent on early activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03BAB.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010). Conclusions Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection. It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, L.; Zhu, F.; Xie, L.; Wang, C.; Wang, J.; Chen, R.; Jia, P.; Guan, H.

Infection possesses unique characteristics that account for this disproportionate degree of fear: it is transmitted rapidly and invisibly; historically, it has accounted for major morbidity and mortality; old forms re-emerge and new forms emerge; and both the media and society are often in awe. Because, in an outbreak, the patient is both a victim and a vector, and because there exists the potential for infringement of personal rights in order to control an outbreak, infection may be viewed (and has been depicted in popular culture) as a foreign invasion. During recent outbreaks, fear, denial, stigmatization and loss have been recorded in the implicated individuals. Stigmatization and discrimination may further involve ethical correlations, and attempts to adress these issues through activism may also have unwarranted effects. Public health initiatives can address the public\u0027s fears by increasing health literacy, which can contribute to reducing stigmatization.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pappas, G.; Kiriaze, I.

This study aims to evaluate the association between first-line antihypertensive drug class and medication adherence in a large Chinese population. Methods All patients prescribed \u2265 one antihypertensive drug in 2001\u20132003 and 2005 who have paid at least two consecutive clinic visits in the public healthcare system of Hong Kong were included. We excluded patients who have followed-up in the clinics for \u226430days. Interval-based Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was used to assess medication adherence. All patients were followed-up for up to 5years. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with optimal adherence, defined as PDC \u226580%. Results From 147,914 eligible patients, 69.2% were adherent to the antihypertensive prescriptions. When compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), patients initially prescribed \u03B1-blockers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.234, 95% C.I. 0.215\u20130.256), \u03B2-blockers (AOR=0.447, 95% C.I. 0.420, 0.477), thiazide diuretics (AOR=0.431 95% C.I. 0.399, 0.466) and calcium channel blockers (AOR=0.451, 95% C.I. 0.423, 0.481) were significantly less likely to be drug adherers. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and fixed-dose combination therapies were similarly likely to be medication adherent. Older age, male gender, visits in general out-patient clinics, residence in urbanized regions, and the presence of comorbidity were positively associated with optimal drug adherence. Conclusion Patients receiving initial prescriptions of ACEIs, ARB and combination therapy had more favorable adherence profiles than the other major antihypertensive classes in real-life clinical practice.","publish_time":"2013-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Martin C.S.; Tam, Wilson W.S.; Cheung, Clement S.K.; Tong, Ellen L.H.; Sek, Antonio C.H.; Cheung, N.

This antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity increased with the MAb that showed a neutralizing activity with feline kidney cells, suggesting that there was a distinct correlation between ADE activity and the neutralizing activity. The close association between enhancing and neutralizing epitopes is an obstacle to developing a vaccine containing only neutralizing epitopes without enhancing epitopes. In this study, we immunized cats with cell lysate with recombinant baculovirus-expressed N protein of the Type I FIPV strain KU-2 with an adjuvant and investigated its preventive effect on the progression of FIP. Cats immunized with this vaccine produced antibodies against FIPV virion-derived N protein but did not produce virus-neutralizing antibodies. A delayed type hypersensitivity skin response to N protein was observed in these vaccinated cats, showing that cell mediated immunity against the FIPV antigen was induced. When these vaccinated cats were challenged with a high dose of heterologous FIPV, the survival rate was 75% (6/8), while the survival rate in the control group immunized with SF-9 cell-derived antigen was 12.5% (1/8).

We investigated the performance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia among children from 7 low- and middle-income countries. METHODS. We tested blood by PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin gene in children aged 1\u201359 months in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. Children had World Health Organization\u2013defined severe or very severe pneumonia or were age-frequency\u2013matched community controls. Additionally, we tested blood from general pediatric admissions in Kilifi, Kenya, a PERCH site. The proportion PCR-positive was compared among cases with microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP), cases without a confirmed bacterial infection (nonconfirmed), cases confirmed for nonpneumococcal bacteria, and controls. RESULTS. In PERCH, 7.3% (n = 291/3995) of cases and 5.5% (n = 273/4987) of controls were blood pneumococcal PCR-positive (P \u003C .001), compared with 64.3% (n = 36/56) of MCPP cases and 6.3% (n = 243/3832) of nonconfirmed cases (P \u003C .001). Blood pneumococcal PCR positivity was higher in children from the 5 African countries (5.5%\u201311.5% among cases and 5.3%\u201310.2% among controls) than from the 2 Asian countries (1.3% and 1.0% among cases and 0.8% and 0.8% among controls). Among Kilifi general pediatric admissions, 3.9% (n = 274/6968) were PCR-positive, including 61.7% (n = 37/60) of those with positive blood cultures for pneumococcus. DISCUSSION.

Up to date, various vaccines developed against TGEV still need to be improved. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, two shRNA-expressing plasmids (pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular (ST) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) and MTS assays demonstrated that both shRNAs were capable of protecting cells against TGEV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and up to 100%, respectively.

These cytokines orchestrate the elimination of the viruses but are occasionally detrimental to the hosts. The outcomes and pathogenesis of viral infection are largely determined by the specific interaction between the viruses and their host cells. Therefore, compounds that either inhibit viral infection or modulate virus-induced cytokine response should be considered as candidates for managing virus infection. The aim of the study was to identify compounds in both categories, using a single cell-based assay. Our screening platform is a HEK293 cell-based reporter assay where the expression of a firefly luciferase is under the control of a human IFN-\u03B2 promoter. We have demonstrated that infection of the reporter cell line with a panel of RNA viruses activated the reporter gene expression that correlates quantitatively with the levels of virus replication and progeny virus production, and could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by known antiviral compound or inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways. Using Dengue virus as an example, a pilot screening of a small molecule library consisting of 26,900 compounds proved the concept that the IFN-\u03B2 promoter reporter assay can serve as a convenient high throughput screening platform for simultaneous discovery of antiviral and innate immune response modulating compounds. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae.","publish_time":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Fang; Zhao, Xuesen; Gill, Tina; Zhou, Yan; Campagna, Matthew; Wang, Lijuan; Liu, Fei; Zhang, Pinghu; DiPaolo, Laura; Du, Yanming; Xu, Xiaodong; Jiang, Dong; Wei, Lai; Cuconati, Andrea; Block, Timothy M; Guo, Ju-Tao; Chang, Jinhong","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8b1ad82c7bc9d3f2cdb2714aadd3f276cb706d4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e647582434cad591b8598ec89d52c75aa16848de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4143146.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214001168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214001168; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4143146?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PRR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus infection of host cells","Dengue virus","pilot screening","progeny virus production","reporter cell line","levels of virus replication","pathogenesis of viral infection","HEK293 cell-based reporter assay","IFN-\u03B2 promoter reporter assay","virus-induced cytokine response","reporter gene expression","single cell-based assay","representative antiviral compound","innate immune response modulating compounds","panel of RNA viruses","convenient high throughput screening platform","human IFN-\u03B2 promoter","simultaneous discovery of antiviral","production of type","inflammatory cytokines","innate pattern recognition receptors","PRRs","inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways","IFNs","control","small molecule library","interferons","dose-dependent manner","concept","example","candidates","firefly luciferase","thiazol","outcomes","specific interaction","categories","ethoxybenzo","study","family of flaviviridae","elimination","methoxyphenyl","urea","aim","hosts"],"language":"en"},

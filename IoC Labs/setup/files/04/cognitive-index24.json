These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between human\u2013animal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities. Vector-borne diseases also have a natural advantage of dissemination.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sudhan, Shashi S.; Sharma, Preeti","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30b29a0e878a8b5c39b8799c081a15d834abe19a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149643.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000041","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","new populations","emerging infections","new viruses","new disease","public health infrastructure","public health risks","public health systems","introduction of infections","novel infections","new variant","increase","new host populations","breakdown of public health measures","disease emergence","environment change","microbial variants","microbial adaptation","microbial traffic","urgent need","cases","rich source of emerging diseases","reemergence of infectious diseases","natural advantage of dissemination","human population","natural hosts","zoonotic crossing","active agents","zoonotic pool","selective advantage","Specific factors","ongoing evolution of viral","commerce","deforestation","ecological changes","agricultural development","major impact","humans","technology","microbes","animal interface","reasons","deficiencies","animals","selection","collaboration","isolated groups","drug resistance","Altered virus transmission","effective surveillance","control","opportunity","species","result","number of activities","conditions","obscurity","rare occasions","pathogens","near future","similarities","epidemics","prevalence"],"language":"en"},

In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

Efficient replication of CCoV-A76 is restricted to canine cell lines, in contrast to the prototypical type II strain CCoV-1-71 that more efficiently replicates in feline cells. CCoV-A76 can use canine aminopeptidase N (cAPN) receptor for infection of cells, but was unable to use feline APN (fAPN). In contrast, CCoV-1-71 can utilize both. Genomic analysis shows that CCoV-A76 possesses a distinct spike, which is the result of a recombination between type I and type II CCoV, that occurred between the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and C-domain) of the S1 subunit.

The replication cycle begins with attachment of viral proteins to host cell receptors. The presence or absence of receptors is an important factor in determining if the cell is permissive for infection. The next step in the virus replication cycle is transfer of the genome into cytosol or nucleoplasm. Some viruses transport just their nucleic acid genomes into the cell while others deliver the entire virion. Once in the cell, virion proteins and genome interact with a variety of cell proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. Productive replication requires synthesis of viral mRNAs, protein, and genomes. The details of these processes vary widely. However, to be successful a virus must be able to compete with host cell for building materials. For example, as the cell is constantly synthesizing proteins, viral mRNAs must be able to redirect ribosomes to their own mRNAs. Some viruses can shut down cellular transcription and translation to redirect those processes to the production of viral proteins. In contrast DNA viruses have developed methods to induce cell DNA replication and/or cell division to obtain materials necessary for genome synthesis. Viruses pack a lot of information into their relatively small genomes. Most do not have the complex promoters that drive cell transcription nor do they have long noncoding introns in their genes. Viruses that replicate in the nucleus often use alternative splicing to generate families of related mRNAs from a single precursor transcript. In other cases a single transcript may be used to produce multiple proteins by ribosome-mediated processes such as leaky scanning, stop codon suppression, and frame shifting. Once viral building blocks have been synthesized, new virions are assembled and must leave the cell. Again, the details of these processes can vary widely. Some of the simplest viruses can assemble in a test tube, from purified capsid proteins and genomes. More complex viruses use a variety of cell proteins and structures for assembly and release.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variety of cell proteins","cell transcription","cell receptors","cell division","cell DNA replication","virion proteins","attachment of viral proteins","production of viral proteins","multiple proteins","capsid proteins","synthesizing proteins","complex viruses","viruses transport","simplest viruses","synthesis of viral mRNAs","virus replication cycle","contrast DNA viruses","Productive replication","Abstract Virus replication","viral building blocks","genome synthesis","small genomes","nucleic acid genomes","families of related mRNAs","ribosome-mediated processes","single transcript","building materials","host cells","details","single precursor transcript","nucleic acids","materials necessary","absence of receptors","cellular transcription","complex promoters","entire virion","specific interactions","methods","leaky scanning","structures","alternative splicing","test tube","codon suppression","important factor","assembly","lot of information","nucleus","release","translation","membranes","step","ribosomes","noncoding introns","new virions","genes","frame","presence","cytosol","nucleoplasm","cases","infection","example"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the role of the 3C protein, a full-length 3c gene was transiently expressed and the cytoplasmic distribution of the protein was found to be primarily in the perinuclear region. Using 3c-stable expression cells, the replication of a 3c-defective FCoV strain was titrated and a significant decrease in replication (p \u003C 0.05) was observed. The mechanism underlying the decreased FIPV replication caused by the 3C protein was further investigated; neither the induction nor inhibition of autophagy rescued the viral replication. Taken together, our data suggest that the 3C protein might have a virulence-suppressing effect in FCoV-infected cats.

Modulation of innate immunity by synthetic variants of host defense peptides, called innate defense regulators (IDRs), is protective without direct antimicrobial action. We discuss the potential and current limitations in exploiting the immunomodulatory activity of IDRs as a novel anti-infective pathway. IDRs show significant promise and current research is uncovering mechanistic information that will aid in the future development of IDRs for clinical use.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Easton, Donna M.; Nijnik, Anastasia; Mayer, Matthew L.; Hancock, Robert E.W.","journal":"Trends in Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d1fba93202bde59044de4d458a69e21b5ab5d78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19683819/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016777990900122X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016777990900122X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Antimicrobial host defense peptides","immunomodulatory activity of IDRs","synthetic variants of host defense peptides","innate defense regulators","future development of IDRs","potential","modulation of host immune responses","new class of antimicrobial drugs","Modulation of innate immunity","direct antimicrobial action","current research","current limitations","new strategy","immunomodulatory activities","clearance of infectious agents","treatment of infectious disease","tissue damage","significant promise","mechanistic information","clinical use","novel anti-infective pathway","inflammation"],"language":"en"},

Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand\u2013receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds.

Results CRV infections in cancer patients may lead to pneumonia in approximately 30% of the cases, with an associated mortality of around 25%. For diagnosis of a CRV infection, combined nasal/throat swabs or washes/aspirates give the best results and nucleic acid amplification based-techniques (NAT) should be used to detect the pathogen. Hand hygiene, contact isolation and face masks have been shown to be of benefit as general infection management. Causal treatment can be given for influenza, using a neuraminidase inhibitor, and respiratory syncytial virus, using ribavirin in addition to intravenous immunoglobulins. Ribavirin has also been used to treat parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus, but data are inconclusive in this setting. Cidofovir is used to treat adenovirus pneumonitis.

The GBP domain of the fusion protein serves as an anchoring component onto the gold surface, exploiting the gold binding affinity of the domain, whereas the SCVme domain is a recognition element for anti-SCVme antibody, the target analyte in this study. SPR analysis indicated the fusion protein simply and strongly self-immobilized onto the gold surface, through GBP, without surface chemical modification, offering a stable and specific sensing platform for anti-SCVme detection. AFM and SPR imaging analyses demonstrated that anti-SCVme specifically bound to the fusion protein immobilized onto the gold-micropatterned chip, implying that appropriate orientation of bound fusion protein by GBP resulted in optimal exposure of the SCVme domain to the assay solution, resulting in efficient capture of anti-SCVme antibody. The best packing density of the fusion protein onto the SPR chip was achieved at the concentration of 10\u03BCgmL\u22121; this density showed the highest detection response (906RU) for anti-SCVme. The fusion protein-coated SPR chip at the best packing density had a lower limit of detection of 200ngmL\u22121 anti-SCVme within 10min and also allowed selective detection of anti-SCVme with significantly low responses for non-specific mouse IgG at all tested concentrations.

To develop specific fusion inhibitors against LASV, we solved the crystal structure of the post-fusion 6 helix bundle (6-HB) formed by two heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) of GP2. This fusion core contains a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices, around which three HR2 helices are entwined in an antiparallel manner. Various hydrophobic and charged interactions form between HR1 and HR2 domains to stabilize the overall conformation of GP2 fusion core. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. We found that the longer HR2 peptides were effective in inhibiting LASV GPC protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion under low pH condition. These results not only suggest that LASV infects the target cell mainly through endocytosis, including micropinocytosis, and membrane fusion at low pH, but also provide an important basis for rational design of LASV fusion inhibitors.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuejiao; Wang, Cong; Chen, Baohua; Wang, Qian; Xu, Wei; Ye, Sheng; Jiang, Shibo; Zhu, Yun; Zhang, Rongguang","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b478a28315d64c252456c44fe8ead59d389f615.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6700223.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LASV","LASV GPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell fusion","post-fusion","membrane fusion","specific fusion inhibitors","HR2 domains","HR2 helices","rational design of LASV fusion inhibitors","overall conformation of GP2 fusion core","longer HR2 peptides","target cell","HR1 helices","inhibiting LASV GPC protein-mediated cell","host cell receptors","GP2 of Lassa virus","low pH condition","crystal structure","specific treatment options","interactions form","parallel trimeric coiled-coil","important basis","micropinocytosis","envelope glycoproteins GP1","approved vaccines","helix bundle","viral infection","endocytosis","heptad","HB","antiviral activities","antiparallel manner","results"],"language":"en"},

This occurred more promptly where the environment was subject to heavier bovine parvovirus contamination due to management practices. The concurrent presence of moderate levels of residual serum antibody had only minor influence on the onset of the infection. On one beef cattle property, onset of intestinal bovine parvovirus infection was associated with an outbreak of post-weaning diarrhoea.

A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential. Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28\u201343 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25\u201343 ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter. This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Broek, M. P. H.; M\u00F6hlmann, J.

This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi\u2019s Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24\u20130.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

This paper reports a simple method for dissecting the viral protein and for searching for foldable fragments in a random but systematic manner. The method involves digestion by DNase I to generate a pool of short DNA segments, followed by an additional step of reassembly of these segments to produce a library of DNA fragments with random ends but controllable lengths. To rapidly screen for discrete folded polypeptide fragments, the reassembled gene fragments were further cloned into a vector as N-terminal fusions to a folding reporter gene which was a variant of green fluorescent protein. Two foldable fragments were identified for the SARS-CoV spike protein, which coincide with various anti-SARS peptides derived from the hepated repeat (HR) region 2 of the spike protein. The method should be applicable to other viral proteins to isolate antigen or vaccine candidates, thus providing an alternative to the full-length proteins (subunits) or linear short peptides.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shuang; Cai, Zhen; Chen, Yong; Lin, Zhanglin","journal":"Tsinghua Science \u0026 Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a851fc7cabbfff270553ff6b8b941cd5551144e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128849.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100702140670222X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1007-0214(06)70222-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288412/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S100702140670222X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foldable fragments","SARS-CoV spike protein","reassembled gene fragments","library of DNA fragments","discrete folded polypeptide fragments","viral proteins","variant of green fluorescent protein","simple method","various anti-SARS peptides","pool of short DNA segments","linear short peptides","cell fusion","random ends","full-length proteins","folding reporter gene","target cell surface receptors","binding","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","subunits","hepated repeat","N-terminal fusions","alternative","region","vaccine candidates","controllable lengths","HR","antigen","vector","additional step","systematic manner","DNase","digestion","paper"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \u201CCellPhoneDB\u201D analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng","journal":"Biochem Biophys Res Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f6a4c37c7c20e77dc239f09da7b00df8a07ed10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156119.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20305234; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20305234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199615/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ENPEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human cells","human tissues","human CoVs","SARS-CoV","CoV-targets","ACE2 partner","candidate co-receptors","single cell co-expression spectrum","cell types","cell crosstalk","known receptors","CoVs targets","reported RNA virus receptors","single cell gene expression atlas","ileum ECs","epithelial cells","surrounding cells","different tissues","ENPEP","lung AT2","potential receptor","DPP4","ANPEP","stomach","similar expression patterns","colon colonocytes","rectum ECs","immune defense","liver cholangiocyte","immune pathogenesis","virus entry","auxiliary proteins","membrane proteins","host receptor","potential candidates","importance of tissue macrophages","kidney proximal tubules","esophagus keratinocytes","expressing levels","phagocytosis","peptidases","global public health emergency","Wuhan","China","analysis","recent reports","chemokine","outbreak","new coronavirus","Hubei","CellPhoneDB","Angiotensin","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Clinical characteristics of RSV\u2010only infections were compared with other single agent viral infections. Results: Positive results were confirmed in 275 (86.5%) of the 318 children studied. A single virus was detected in 196 patients and 79 were dual or multiple viral infections. RSV was detected in 61.3% of total bronchiolitis. Rhinovirus (RV) was 17.4% of the identified virus, followed by human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus and metapneumovirus (hMPV). Only RV, HBoV and hMPV were significant as single infections. RSV patients were younger than HBoV (p \u003E 0.0001) and hMPV (p = 0.025). Seasonality was clearly different between them. Children with RSV infection needed treatment in the intensive care unit more frequently than others. Conclusions: In hospitalized infants, RSV was the most frequent agent in bronchiolitis in winter, but other viruses were present in 47% of the patients.

Here, we described PF in mice infected with H5N1 virus. METHODS: Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 \u00D7 10(1 )MID(50 )of A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002(H5N1) viruses. Lung injury/fibrosis was evaluated by observation of hydroxyproline concentrations, lung indexes, and histopathology on days 7, 14, and 30 postinoculation. RESULTS: H5N1-inoculated mice presented two stages of pulmonary disease over a 30-d period after infection. At acute stage, infected-mice showed typical diffuse pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema and hemorrhage on day 7 postinoculation. At restoration stage, most infected-mice developed PF of different severities on day 30 postinoculation, and 18% of the survived mice underwent severe interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis with thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli and large fibrotic areas. The dramatically elevated hydroxyproline levels in H5N1-infected mice showed deposition of collagen in lungs, and confirmed fibrosis of lungs. The dry lung-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in infected group, which might be associated with the formation of PF in H5N1-infected mice.

Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, the mortality remains unacceptably high, ranging from 34% to 64%. Hence, ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Several promising targets that have been identified as potential therapies for ARDS have been limited because of difficulty with delivery. In particular, delivery of peptides and proteins to the lung is an ongoing challenge. Nanobiotechnology and nanoscience are the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmakodynamics of agents allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs, resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. These systems are exploited for therapeutic purpose to carry the drug in the body in a controlled manner from the site of administration to the therapeutic target. Hence, it is an attractive strategy to test potential targets for ALI/ARDS using nanotechnology. To this end, we have identified several potential targets and proposed the delivery of these agents using nanomicelles to improve the drug delivery.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sadikot, Ruxana T.","journal":"Methods in Enzymology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acb84758409b4744b6e71479df137ee0113cb10e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149708.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-391860-4.00016-1; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123918604000161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449933/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123918604000161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ALI/ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential targets","Nanoscale drug delivery systems","delivery of peptides","drug toxicity","therapeutic target","molecular pathogenesis of ARDS","biodistribution of therapeutic agents","pharmakodynamics of agents","therapeutic purpose","potential therapies","promising targets","Abstract Acute lung injury","site of inflamed organs","heterogenous group of lung disease","site of administration","acute respiratory distress syndrome","ability","urgency","drugs","improved efficacy","proteins","controlled manner","basis of innovative techniques","unmet medical need","nanoscience","reduction","mortality","nanomicelles","increased understanding","ill patients","attractive strategy","pharmacokinetics","body","nanotechnology","effective pharmacotherapies","ongoing challenge","Nanobiotechnology","lungs","difficulty","end"],"language":"en"},

DENV replicates at ER-derived cytoplasmic structures that include substructures called convoluted membranes (CMs); however, the purpose of these membrane alterations remains unclear. We determine that DENV nonstructural protein (NS)4B, a promising drug target with unknown function, associates with mitochondrial proteins and alters mitochondria morphology to promote infection. During infection, NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria, which physically contact CMs. This restructuring compromises the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes, sites of ER-mitochondria interface critical for innate immune signaling. The spatio-temporal parameters of CM biogenesis and mitochondria elongation are linked to loss of activation of the fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1. Mitochondria elongation promotes DENV replication and alleviates RIG-I-dependent activation of interferon responses. As Zika virus infection induces similar mitochondria elongation, this perturbation may protect DENV and related viruses from innate immunity and create a favorable replicative environment.","publish_time":"2016-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatel-Chaix, Laurent; Cortese, Mirko; Romero-Brey, In\u00E9s; Bender, Silke; Neufeldt, Christopher John; Fischl, Wolfgang; Scaturro, Pietro; Schieber, Nicole; Schwab, Yannick; Fischer, Bernd; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5ac2988ada7681f28c933cc3caeea19bb0e4f07.json; document_parses/pdf_json/37618db734bfa87cf54a9562ad2c6fd884471791.json; document_parses/pdf_json/70b1acb0757c8b0c6f193a7d2f17519bb73a7cef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105029.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312816303079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545046/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816303079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elongation of mitochondria","similar mitochondria elongation","integrity of mitochondria","mitochondria morphology","mitochondria interface critical","DENV replicates","DENV replication","DENV nonstructural protein","Zika virus infection","CMs","sites of ER","innate immunity","convoluted membranes","innate immune","Dengue virus","associated membranes","loss of activation","related viruses","fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein","ER-derived cytoplasmic structures","dependent activation of interferon responses","unknown function","associates","promising drug target","substructures","mitochondrial proteins","available vaccines","perturbation","biogenesis","RIG","purpose","spatio-temporal parameters","favorable replicative environment","antiviral drugs","public health concern","membrane alterations","NS4B","restructuring"],"language":"en"},

A group of feline coronavirus (FCoV)\u2010positive cats, comprising cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and cats not affected by FIP but seropositive for FCoV, were included in this study because the serum concentration of AGP increases during FCoV infection. Procedure Flow cytometry (using an anti\u2010feline AGP antibody), serum protein electrophoresis, routine haematology and measurement of the serum AGP concentration were performed using blood samples from 32 healthy cats (19 FCoV\u2010seropositive), 13 cats with FIP and 12 with other diseases (6 FCoV\u2010seropositive). The proportion of cats with AGP\u2010positive leucocytes in the different groups (e.g. controls vs sick; FIP vs other diseases, etc.) or in cats with different intensities of inflammatory response was compared using a Chi\u2010square test.

There is ample evidence to suggest that modeling may be a viable approach to accomplish this task. Methods To demonstrate the importance of synergism between modelers, public health experts, and policymakers, the University of Winnipeg organized an interdisciplinary workshop on the role of models in pandemic preparedness in September 2008. The workshop provided an excellent opportunity to present outcomes of recent scientific investigations that thoroughly evaluate the merits of preventive, therapeutic, and social distancing mechanisms, where community structures, priority groups, healthcare providers, and responders to emergency situations are given specific consideration. Results This interactive workshop was clearly successful in strengthening ties between various disciplines and creating venues for modelers to effectively communicate with policymakers. The importance of modeling in pandemic planning was highlighted, and key parameters that affect policy decision\u2010making were identified. Core assumptions and important activities in Canadian pandemic plans at the provincial and national levels were also discussed. Conclusions There will be little time for thoughtful and rapid reflection once an influenza pandemic strikes, and therefore preparedness is an unavoidable priority. Modeling and simulations are key resources in pandemic planning to map out interdependencies and support complex decision\u2010making. Models are most effective in formulating strategies for managing public health crises when there are synergies between modelers, planners, and policymakers.","publish_time":"2009-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moghadas, Seyed M.; Pizzi, Nick J.; Wu, Jianhong; Yan, Ping","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6293160da51ace8a72b0297d94e05ec9ad4276b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634525.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2009.00081.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19496845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic preparedness","pandemic planning","modelers","policymakers","Canadian pandemic plans","influenza pandemic strikes","importance of modeling","public health crises","public health experts","cost\u2010effective public health policies","interdisciplinary workshop","interactive workshop","implementation of effective","engagement of scientific","major task","key resources","priority groups","integrated approach","key parameters","various disciplines","role of models","importance of synergism","viable approach","unavoidable priority","policy decision\u2010making","complex decision\u2010making","present outcomes of recent scientific investigations","community structures","healthcare providers","rapid reflection","responders","social distancing mechanisms","important activities","design","formulating strategies","emergency situations","excellent opportunity","little time","synergies","simulations","Core assumptions","University of Winnipeg","enormity of challenges","merits of preventive","political communities","venues","interdependencies","specific consideration","national levels","planners","Conclusions","Background","Methods","ample evidence"],"language":"en"},

Chicken embryo fibroblast DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 10. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of chMDA5 were performed by transfecting DF-1 cells with chMDA5-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chMDA5-expressing DNA. The transfected cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at an MOI of 10. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were collected at 2, 8, 16 and 24 hours postinfection (hpi) for IBDV titer determination and RNA extraction, respectively. IBDV RNA loads and mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), IFN-\u03B2, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), myxovirus resistance gene (Mx), and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The IBDV titer increased up to 1.4 \u00D7 10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL at 24 hpi, and the IBDV RNA load reached 464 ng/\u03BCL at 24 hpi. The mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-\u03B2, PKR, OAS, Mx and MHC class I in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells exhibited significant (p \u003C 0.05) upregulation up to 906-, 199-, 26,310-, 12-, 66,144-, 64,039- and 33-fold, respectively. Expressed chMDA5 from transfection and double-stranded RNA from IBDV infection were localized or colocalized in the cytoplasm of DF-1 cells at 16 hpi. When chMDA5 was knocked down in DF-1 cells, IBDV titers and RNA loads were significantly higher (p \u003C 0.05) than those in DF-1 cells without chMDA5 knockdown at 24 hpi. The expression levels of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-\u03B2 and MHC class I in chMDA5-knockdown DF-1 cells were significantly lower (p \u003C 0.05) at 16 and 24 hpi. DF-1 cells overexpressing chMDA5 by transfection with chMDA5 expressing DNA had significantly lower (p \u003C 0.05) IBDV titers and RNA loads at 16 and 24 hpi and showed significantly higher (p \u003C 0.05) expression of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-\u03B2, PKR, OAS, Mx and MHC class I at 2 hpi. The results indicated that chicken MDA5 recognized IBDV infection and that this interaction resulted in the activation of chMDA5-related innate immune genes and upregulation of chicken MHC class I.","publish_time":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Chih-Chun; Wu, Ching Ching; Lin, Tsang Long","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/718f56ad4fc4fffbb6e3283fb550fddac0ddc915.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-1983-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBDV","PKR","OAS","MHC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBDV infection","hpi","IBDV-infected DF","chMDA5-knockdown DF","IBDV RNA load","IBDV titers","IBDV LP1","chMDA5 knockdown","expression of chicken MDA5","activation of chMDA5","overexpression of chMDA5","IFN-\u03B2","upregulation of chicken MHC class","RNA loads","mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5","IBDV titer determination","transfected cells","Chicken embryo fibroblast DF","RNA extraction","transfecting DF","cytoplasm of DF","interferon-\u03B2","IRF","small interfering RNA","Mx","OAS","PKR","chicken melanoma differentiation-associated gene","double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase","multiplicity of infection","major histocompatibility complex class","transfection","DNA","MOI","innate immune response","related innate immune genes","myxovirus resistance gene","interferon regulatory factor","senses infectious bursal disease virus","IPS","siRNA","promoter stimulator","\u03BCL","interaction","oligoadenylate synthetase","present study","hours postinfection","Cell culture supernatants","lysates","PFU","addition","pathway","results","real-time RT-PCR","plaque","units","objective","fold"],"language":"en"},

More recently, there has been an alarming increase in drug-resistant microbes. Furthermore, new pathogens are emerging due to microbial evolution and adaptation. The spread of these diseases is a result of pathogen mutations and changes in human behavior patterns. Then, there are diseases that are lurking in the background, waiting for the right conditions before they strike again. In the war against these diseases, we have come to understand the behaviors of microbes in a heterogeneous world and the mechanisms governing disease transmission. These works have profoundly shaped modern knowledge of emerging and re-emerging infections. More recently, computational techniques have led the way into this new era by allowing rapid high-throughput analysis of pathogens which was previously not possible using traditional laboratory techniques. This chapter introduces methods in mathematical modeling, computational biology, and bioinformatics that have been used to study infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tong, Joo Chuan; Ranganathan, Shoba","journal":"Computer-Aided Vaccine Design","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e648bbc887a232813e6fd7365f9a74e38ed633b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151758.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781907568411500076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781907568411500076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","new pathogens","computational techniques","computational biology","new era","behaviors of microbes","drug-resistant microbes","traditional laboratory techniques","shaped modern knowledge of emerging","rapid high-throughput analysis of pathogens","changes","result of pathogen mutations","heterogeneous world","mathematical modeling","methods","human behavior patterns","re-emerging infections","microbial evolution","mechanisms","alarming increase","serious burden","way","disease transmission","chapter","works","bioinformatics","adaptation","background","history","right conditions","mankind","spread","war"],"language":"en"},

We show that cholesterol depletion by treatment with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (m\u03B2CD) affects infection by SARS-CoV to the same extent as infection by vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes containing the surface glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV (VSV-\u0394G-S). Therefore, the role of cholesterol for SARS-CoV infection can be assigned to the S protein and is unaffected by other coronavirus proteins. There have been contradictory reports whether or not angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, is present in detergent-resistant membrane domains. We found that ACE2 of both Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells co-purifies with marker proteins of detergent-resistant membranes supporting the notion that cholesterol-rich microdomains provide a platform facilitating the efficient interaction of the S protein with the cellular receptor ACE2. To understand the involvement of cholesterol in the initial steps of the viral life cycle, we applied a cell-based binding assay with cells expressing the S protein and cells containing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Alternatively, we used a soluble S protein as interaction partner. Depletion of cholesterol from the ACE2-expressing cells reduced the binding of S-expressing cells by 50% whereas the binding of soluble S protein was not affected. This result suggests that optimal infection requires a multivalent interaction between viral attachment protein and cellular receptors.","publish_time":"2008-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glende, Joerg; Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Al-Falah, Marwan; Pfefferle, Susanne; Qu, Xiuxia; Deng, Hongkui; Drosten, Christian; Naim, Hassan Y.; Herrler, Georg","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55f5628eff24df708f214d49512c6cbb685760a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.08.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208005540; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208005540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18814896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","binding of soluble S protein","cholesterol depletion","Depletion of cholesterol","surface glycoprotein S of SARS","cells co-","involvement of cholesterol","role of cholesterol","cellular receptor ACE2","viral attachment protein","optimal infection","Abstract Cholesterol present","cholesterol-rich microdomains","plasma membrane of target cells","multivalent interaction","efficient interaction","interaction partner","angiotensin","cellular receptors","binding assay","enzyme","detergent-resistant membrane domains","marker proteins of detergent","resistant membranes","coronavirus proteins","viral life cycle","vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes","initial steps","notion","extent","methyl-\u03B2","cyclodextrin","treatment","platform","m\u03B2CD","Caco","Vero E6","VSV-\u0394G","contradictory reports","result"],"language":"en"},

Since nanomaterials display remarkable physical and chemical properties, high surface area to volume ratio, and increased reactivity, new approaches for antiviral therapies include combinations of nanomaterials and current antiviral agents. Multivalent nanostructures, polymers, dendrimers, and liposomes can establish multivalent binding interactions with many biological systems and thus can target pathogenic interactions. There are reports about anitiviral activities of different metal nanoparticles, especially silver nanoparticles and their potential for treatment, prophylaxis, and control of viral infections. Integration of classic antiviral drugs, in the form of multiple ligands, onto nanostructures provides the advantages by creating a high local concentration of active molecules.

The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19. Aims of the study this review aimed to report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice since the emergence of the virus. Methods A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed, full articles in English published from December 1st , 2019 to March 26th , 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral and antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion. Results As of March 26th, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449); forty-one studies were included. These consisted of clinical trials (n=3), case reports (n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). The most commonly reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and Oseltamivir (n=16). Conclusions This is the first systematic review to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only 41 research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China. Corticosteroid therapy was found to be the most studied medicine in the literature.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tobaiqy, Mansour; Qashqary, Mohammed; Al-Dahery, Shrooq; Mujallad, Alaa; Hershan, Almonther Abdullah; Kamal, Mohammad Azhar; Helmi, Nawal","journal":"Infection Prevention in Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02206b0c97058d5723e4a7a65d0654229834cbf9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300251?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590088920300251; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","systematic review protocol","causative agent of COVID","patients","evidence of therapeutics","research articles","observational studies","China","Abstract Background SARS-CoV","clinical practice","type of study design eligible","reported medicine","case reports","case series","studied medicine","clinical trials","Embase","Medline","glucocorticoids","electronic databases","convalescent plasma","emergence","inclusion","combinations","corticosteroids","Google Scholar","restrictions","treatment guidelines","search terms","Methods","date","PRISMA Statement","country","virus","literature","accessible peer","initial manuscripts","Conclusions","retrospective","Oseltamivir","Corticosteroid therapy","global pandemic","English","Lopinavir","Results"],"language":"en"},

The connections inside certain community are referred as inter-contacts while the intra-contacts denote the connections among communities. For the epidemic spreading process, the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is adopted. Then, corresponding state transition trees are determined and simulations are conducted to study the epidemic spreading process in multi-communities. Here, the effect of incorporating virtual layer on the range of individual affected by the epidemic is pursued. As illustrated, multi-summits are incurred if the spreading in multi-communities is considered; furthermore, the disparity between summits varies. This is affected by various factors. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of individuals being affected; moreover, disparity of different summits is likely to be increased regarding with scenarios of excluding virtual layer. Furthermore, the summit is likely to be postponed if virtual layer is incorporated.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Peican; Wang, Xing; Zhi, Qiang; Ma, Jiezhong; Guo, Yangming","journal":"Chaos, Solitons \u0026 Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b6afa6f122a2c19460cb1a776e39594eaf0d5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288353/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077918300493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2018.02.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077918300493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multi-communities","epidemic","spreading","incorporation of virtual layer","multi-summits","intra-contacts","process","connections","disparity of different summits","inter-contacts","certain community","traditional susceptible-infected","simulations","multiplex network","corresponding state transition trees","range of individual","SIR","proportion of individuals","scenarios","model","Abstract","practice","effect","various factors","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

However, this process is inefficient. Experiments were therefore conducted to delineate the rate limiting step(s) involved, using a phage vector that contains a mammalian luciferase reporter gene cassette. The efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells was quantitated, in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of cell uptake and degradation pathways. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and proteasome inhibitors strongly enhanced phage-mediated luciferase expression, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the destruction of intracellular phage particles. In contrast, inhibition of endosome acidification had no effect on phage-mediated gene transfer, presumably because phage lambda is tolerant to extended exposure to low pH. These findings provide insights into the pathways by which phage vectors enter and transduce mammalian cells, and suggest that it may be possible to pharmacologically enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells. Finally, the data also suggest that the proteasome complex may serve as an innate defense mechanism that restricts the infection of mammalian cells by diverse viral agents.","publish_time":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volcy, Ketna; Dewhurst, Stephen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c867f9bd7a6d2488d1636d456844ee6bf620390.json; document_parses/pdf_json/999f0919dc449e0cd859b1e0c9f05b74363158f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2654414.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064273/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007575; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2654414?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007575","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of phage","efficiency of phage","phage vectors","phage-mediated gene transfer","infection of mammalian cells","enhanced phage-mediated luciferase expression","destruction of intracellular phage particles","mammalian luciferase reporter gene cassette","proteasome inhibitors","degradation pathways","Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases","Bacteriophage lambda vectors","proteasome complex","absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of cell uptake","effect","exposure","genomes","inhibition of endosome acidification","diverse viral agents","innate defense mechanism","presence","low pH","contrast","encoded genes","insights","rate","step","data","findings","process","Experiments"],"language":"en"},

Almost sixty percent of the pathogens that have emerged in humans during the last 30\u201340 years are of animal origin and about sixty percent of them show an important variety of host species besides humans (3 or more possible host species). In this review, we focus on zoonotic infections with vector-borne transmission and dissect the contrasting effects that a multiplicity of host reservoirs and vectors can have on their disease dynamics. We discuss the effects exerted by host and vector species richness and composition on pathogen prevalence (i.e., reduction, including the dilution effect, or amplification). We emphasize that, in multiple host systems and for vector-borne zoonotic pathogens, host reservoir species and vector species can exert contrasting effect locally. The outcome on disease dynamics (reduced pathogen prevalence in vectors when the host reservoir species is rich and increased pathogen prevalence when the vector species richness increases) may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time. We then ask briefly how a shift towards a more systemic perspective in the study of emerging infectious diseases, which are driven by a multiplicity of hosts, may stimulate further research developments. Finally, we propose some research avenues that take better into account the multi-host species reality in the transmission of the most important emerging infectious diseases, and, particularly, suggest, as a possible orientation, the careful assessment of the life-history characteristics of hosts and vectors in a community ecology-based perspective.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roche, Benjamin; Gu\u00E9gan, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"C R Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf1209c9b5bf05cd1c4ab7e1b0f7b5a722ca069f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185632.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1631069111000709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21640947/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069111000709; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2011.02.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host reservoir species","possible host species","multi-host species reality","important variety of host species","multi-host systems","vector species richness increases","multiple host systems","multiplicity of host reservoirs","vectors","increased pathogen prevalence","reduced pathogen prevalence","transmission of infectious agents","important emerging infectious diseases","zoonotic pathogens","study of emerging infectious diseases","contrasting effects","multiplicity of hosts","disease dynamics","humans","percent","research developments","zoonotic infections","systemic perspective","dilution effect","possible orientation","research avenues","major scientific developments","life-history characteristics of hosts","community ecology-based perspective","decade","account","careful assessment","composition","outcome","reduction","animal origin","space","time","years","article","amplification","shift","review"],"language":"en"},

Until 15 May 2014, it has infected at least 572 people with a fatality rate of about 30% globally. Studies to understand the virus and to develop antiviral drugs or therapy are necessary and urgent. In the present study, MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL(pro)) is expressed, and its structural and functional consequences are elucidated. RESULTS: Circular dichroism and Tyr/Trp fluorescence analyses indicated that the secondary and tertiary structure of MERS-CoV PL(pro) is well organized and folded. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses demonstrated that MERS-CoV PL(pro) is a monomer in solution. The steady-state kinetic and deubiquitination activity assays indicated that MERS-CoV PL(pro) exhibits potent deubiquitination activity but lower proteolytic activity, compared with SARS-CoV PL(pro). A natural mutation, Leu105, is the major reason for this difference. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MERS-CoV PL(pro) bound by an endogenous metal ion shows a folded structure and potent proteolytic and deubiquitination activity. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional properties of coronaviral PL(pro) family, which is applicable to develop strategies inhibiting PL(pro) against highly pathogenic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Min-Han; Chuang, Shang-Ju; Chen, Chiao-Che; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Cheng, Kai-Wen; Lin, Chao-Hsiung; Sun, Chiao-Yin; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f719d2ff295ade18c5946296cd7c2436727d2822.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4051379.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-21-54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tyr/Trp"],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV PL","SARS-CoV PL","MERS-CoV papain","potent deubiquitination activity","tertiary structure of MERS","functional properties of coronaviral PL","deubiquitination activity assays","lower proteolytic activity","folded structure","pathogenic human coronavirus","functional consequences","pathogenic coronaviruses","Trp fluorescence analyses","Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Tyr","Circular dichroism","endogenous metal ion","protease","antiviral drugs","steady-state kinetic","important insights","Leu105","therapy","present study","family","major reason","RESULTS","findings","BACKGROUNDS","Jeddah","monomer","strategies","Saudi Arabia","natural mutation","people","fatality rate","difference","solution","CONCLUSIONS","European countries","Studies"],"language":"en"},

In this case, viruses propagated in the natural reservoir species cause disease in nonhuman primates that closely mimics the human disease, but passaging in cell culture attenuates these viruses to the extent that do not cause any measurable disease in nonhuman primates.

(4) what are the advantages and disadvantages of replicating agents as compared to nonreplicating agents as candidate rotavirus vaccines? Although two proteins (vp4 and vp7) are probably important in inducing protection against challenge, it has not been clearly demonstrated that inclusion of the epidemiologically important human P or G type is important in protection against human disease. No immunological effector arm clearly explains protection against heterotypic challenge. Protection against disease is not predicted by rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum. Oral inoculation may not be necessary to induce a protective, virus-specific immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface, but parenteral inoculation of experimental animals with rotavirus induces an immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface that is protective against challenge. Induction of a rotavirus-specific protective immune response is probably associated with the presence of virus-specific T and B cells in intestinal lymphoid tissues and virus-specific sIgA or IgG at the intestinal mucosal surface. There is some experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that neither rotavirus replication nor presentation of rotavirus antigen to the intestinal mucosal surface is necessary to achieve this aim.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Offit, Paul A.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f570f099d9ff961e399d29261ccf3b2998cba63e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708603292; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708603292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus disease","rotavirus-specific protective immune response","virus-specific immune response","intestinal mucosal surface","rotavirus replication","virus-specific sIgA","rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies","presentation of rotavirus antigen","specific T","candidate rotavirus vaccines","presence of virus","important questions","inducing protection","human disease","intestinal lymphoid tissues","important human P","importance of virus serotype","immunological effector arm","heterotypic challenge","nonreplicating agents","parenteral inoculation of experimental animals","Oral inoculation","experimental evidence","disadvantages of replicating agents","B cells","G type","IgG","hypothesis","host","chapter","vp7","serum","vp4","optimal vaccine","inclusion","Induction","Publisher Summary","proteins","aim"],"language":"en"},

Viral replication was assessed by quantification of virus produced through detection of copy numbers of DENV\u20102 RNA, plaque assay and indirect immunofluorescence. qRT\u2010PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV\u20102 load in infected U937 cells after CLQ treatment. It was found that a dose of 50 \u03BCg/mL of CLQ was not toxic to the cells and resulted in significantly less virus production in infected U937 cells than occurred in untreated cells. In the present work, CLQ was effective against DENV\u20102 replication in U937 cells, and also caused a statistically significant reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The present study indicates that CLQ may be used to reduce viral yield in U937 cells.","publish_time":"2014-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farias, Kleber Juvenal Silva; Machado, Paula Renata Lima; de Almeida Junior, Renato Ferreira; de Aquino, Ana Alice; da Fonseca, Benedito Ant\u00F4nio Lopes","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ad3da313db27e490fcecf58a7e5ddd248076144.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168487.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773578/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected U937 cells","treatment of U937 cells","untreated cells","CLQ treatment","quantification of virus","virus production","dengue virus type","Viral replication","present study","detection of copy numbers of DENV","plaque assays","use of chloroquine","present work","viral yield","RNA","intracellular exocytic pathways","amine acidotropic drug","load","significant reduction","expression of proinflammatory cytokines","endosomal pH","indirect immunofluorescence","antiviral agent","qRT","PCR","\u03BCg","dose","objective"],"language":"en"},

Twenty pregnant sows in a PED-positive farm were equally divided into probiotics-administered (VP) and control (VC) sow groups. A commercial live-attenuated vaccine was injected as per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The probiotic compound (15 g/day) was orally administered to VP from 6 weeks pre-parturition to 7 days post-parturition (ppd7). VP had a significantly higher body weight at ppd7 than VC (191 vs 186 kg; P \u003C 0.05). At day 3 post-parturition (ppd3) (4.18 vs 3.63 kg/day) and ppd7 (5.14 vs 4.34 kg/day), milk produced by VP was significantly (P \u003C 0.05) greater than that by VC.

However, total IgG concentration in whey of VP and VC at ppd3 and ppd7 did not differ. Antibody titer was significantly higher at day 0 in serum of VP than it was that of VC (60 vs 37 in geometric mean; P \u003C 0.05). Likewise, the antibody titer in whey of VP and VC was found to be similar at day 0 (416 vs 208 in geometric mean; P = 0.13).

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people\u0027s work and life will be on the right track. METHOD: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. RESULTS: The optimal parameters were estimated as R(0) = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly. It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Kangkang; Chen, Jing; Lu, Changming; Dong, Lanlan; Wu, Zhicheng; Zhang, Lianglu","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e16850bf2740085be7b9852f66df02e87ef6b39e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125416.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.011002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32257174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TE"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["peak of epidemic situation","epidemic dynamics","closure of Wuhan city","peak of infected number","number of deaths","nCoV","interquartile range","number of infected individuals","total number of confirmed infection cases","total deaths","peak time","total confirmed cases","number of susceptible population N","optimal parameters","SEIR modeling method","data","serious public health concerns","life","assumption","trend","Recent outbreak","disease transmission index","study","prediction","people\u0027s work","right track","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","accounting","China","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, conflicting results have been reported on the relative prevalence and severity of the three HRV species. Objectives The relative prevalence and clinical characteristics of HRV-A, B and C, in children attending a South London teaching hospital were investigated retrospectively. Study design Children aged \u003C16 years with episodes of respiratory tract infections and detectable entero/rhinovirus RNA in respiratory samples between November 2009 and December 2010 were investigated. Retrospective case review was performed and patients\u2019 characteristics recorded. Results Entero/rhinoviruses were the commonest viral pathogens (498/2316; 21.5%). Amongst 204 infection episodes associated with entero/rhinovirus, 167 were typed HRV, HRV-C was the most prevalent (99/167, 59.3%) followed by HRV-A (60/167; 35.9%) and HRV-B (8/167, 4.8%). The severity spectrum of HRV-A and HRV-C infections were similar and affected all parts of the respiratory tract. Co-pathogens were observed in 54 (26.5%) episodes. Severity was increased in patients with non-viral co-pathogens and those with an underlying respiratory condition. Univariate and multiple regression analyses of potential prognostic variables including age, co-pathogens and underlying respiratory illnesses showed that mono-infection with HRV-C, as compared with other HRV species, was associated with more severe disease in young children \u003C3 years. Conclusions HRV-C was the most prevalent species and on its own was associated with severe disease in children \u003C3 years. The association between infection with HRV species and clinical presentation is complex and affected by many confounding factors.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauinger, Ina L.; Bible, Jon M.; Halligan, Eugene P.; Bangalore, Harish; Tosas, Olga; Aarons, Emma J.; MacMahon, Eithne; Tong, Cheuk Y.W.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d65775df0ad0ef808d79615f3f08a8bc030adc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108361.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213002746; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213002746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886500/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.06.042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["South London"],"keyphrases":["HRV species","HRV-B","HRV-C infections","Conclusions HRV-C","clinical characteristics of HRV","severity spectrum of HRV","episodes of respiratory tract infections","respiratory illnesses","respiratory samples","years","severe infections","infection episodes","prevalent species","underlying respiratory condition","non-viral co-pathogens","young children","Results Entero","severe disease","commonest viral pathogens","detectable entero","mono-infection","relative prevalence","Study design Children","rhinovirus RNA","clinical presentation","patients\u2019 characteristics","human rhinoviruses","conflicting results","multiple regression analyses of potential prognostic variables","age","South London teaching hospital","Objectives","parts","Retrospective case review","association","confounding factors","Abstract Background"],"language":"en"},

A 68 years-old woman with cardiovascular and cholecystic comorbidities developed rapidly progressed pneumonia with influenza-like-illness as initial symptom, recovered after 23 days-hospitalization including 8 days in ICU. Laboratory indicators for liver and blood coagulation dysfunction were observed. Oseltamivir phosphate, glucocorticoids and antibiotics were jointly implemented, with nasal catheterization of oxygen inhalation for this patient. We obtained the medical records and collected serial respiratory and blood specimens from her. We collected throat, cloacal and/or feces samples of poultry and wild birds from the patient\u2019s backyard, neighborhood, local live poultry markets (LPMs) and the nearest lake. All close contacts of the patient were followed up and sampled with throat swabs and sera. Influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens were tested by real-time RT-PCR, viral culturing and/or sequencing for human respiratory and bird samples. Micro-neutralizing assay was performed for sera. A novel reassortant wild bird-origin H7N4 virus is identified from the patient and her backyard poultry (chickens and ducks) by sequencing, which is distinct from previously-reported avian H7N4 and H7N9 viruses. At least four folds increase of neutralizing antibodies to H7N4 was detected in her convalescent sera. No samples from close contacts, wild birds or other poultry were tested positive for H7N4 by real-time RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2018-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huo, Xiang; Cui, Lun-biao; Chen, Cong; Wang, Dayan; Qi, Xian; Zhou, Ming-hao; Guo, Xiling; Wang, Fengming; Liu, William J.; Kong, Weirong; Ni, Daxin; Chi, Ying; Ge, Yiyue; Huang, Haodi; Hu, Feifei; Li, Chao; Zhao, Xiang; Ren, Ruiqi; Bao, Chang-jun; Gao, George F.; Zhu, Feng-Cai","journal":"Science Bulletin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4f0fa483a7a52721e6545960aac2145df764d62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104738.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927318303220; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927318303220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288966/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["backyard poultry","novel influenza","avian H7N4","Influenza viruses","feces samples of poultry","wild birds","bird samples","novel reassortant wild bird-origin H7N4 virus","influenza H7 subtypes","respiratory pathogens","sequencing","real-time RT-PCR","H7N9 viruses","close contacts","convalescent sera","local live poultry markets","Abstract Human infections","patient\u2019s backyard","blood specimens","days-hospitalization","neutralizing antibodies","throat swabs","blood coagulation dysfunction","Micro-neutralizing assay","neighborhood","cholecystic comorbidities","LPMs","viral culturing","liver","progressed pneumonia","chickens","Laboratory indicators","years-old woman","antibiotics","nasal catheterization of oxygen inhalation","illness","ducks","initial symptom","medical records","Oseltamivir phosphate","glucocorticoids","folds","nearest lake","ICU","concerns"],"language":"en"},

This genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in diverse African nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an African forest giant pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, amended, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs are established relying on a newly established open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV \u002B PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV \u002B simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant pouched rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is divided into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American \u201Ctypes\u201D of PRRSV, both of which now receive virus status. The current species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve known simian arteriviruses. Non-Latinized binomial species names are introduced to replace all current species names to clearly differentiate them from virus names, which remain largely unchanged.","publish_time":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuhn, Jens H.; Lauck, Michael; Bailey, Adam L.; Shchetinin, Alexey M.; Vishnevskaya, Tatyana V.; B\u00E0o, Y\u012Bm\u00EDng; Ng, Terry Fei Fan; LeBreton, Matthew; Schneider, Bradley S.; Gillis, Amethyst; Tamoufe, Ubald; Diffo, Joseph Le Doux; Takuo, Jean Michel; Kondov, Nikola O.; Coffey, Lark L.; Wolfe, Nathan D.; Delwart, Eric; Clawson, Anna N.; Postnikova, Elena; Bollinger, Laura; Lackemeyer, Matthew G.; Radoshitzky, Sheli R.; Palacios, Gustavo; Wada, Jiro; Shevtsova, Zinaida V.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Lapin, Boris A.; Deriabin, Petr G.; Dunowska, Magdalena; Alkhovsky, Sergey V.; Rogers, Jeffrey; Friedrich, Thomas C.; O\u2019Connor, David H.; Goldberg, Tony L.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a46eb139219bd8d89d8b655c9caec208bb099e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5573231.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2672-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["virus names","current genus Arterivirus","current arterivirus nomenclature","novel arterivirus","current species names","current species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus","virus status","respiratory syndrome virus","reproductive syndrome virus","single genus Arterivirus","current species Porcine reproductive","common brushtail arterivirus","equine arteritis virus","improved arterivirus taxonomy","current data","International Code of Virus Classification","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","divergent simian arteriviruses","coding-complete arterivirus genomes","known simian arteriviruses","PRRSV","Non-Latinized binomial species names","EAV","LDV","SHFV","African forest giant pouched rat","forest giant pouched rats","common brushtails","recent version","recent description","diverse African nonhuman primates","established open reading frame","Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs","b phylogeny","Dipartevirus","taxonomic homes","PASC","accordance","Simartevirus","Nesartevirus","New Zealand","comparison","clear divergence","Rodartevirus","genera","family Arteriviridae","Equartevirus","types","addition","result","revision"],"language":"en"},

There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as \u223C19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.","publish_time":"2012-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messer, William B.; Yount, Boyd; Hacker, Kari E.; Donaldson, Eric F.; Huynh, Jeremy P.; de Silva, Aravinda M.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/495132370917fdb1762cd47fa73e9e6ff94a60b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3289595.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389731/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001486","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":["Thailand","Sri Lanka","Cuba","Puerto Rico"],"keyphrases":["recombinant DENV","different DENV","role of DENV genotypic variation","primary DENV infections","genetic determinants of DENV","spatial microevolution of DENV","DENV specific humoral immunity","natural infection","neutralization titers","genotype IV","virus genotype","role of genotypic variation","natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions","repeated infection","neutralization assays","subsequent infection","recombinant viruses","Dengue viruses","lifelong protection","genotypic differences","expressed envelope glycoprotein","background of heterotypic neutralization","influence antibody mediated protection","dengue vaccine trials","dengue scientific community","positive-sense RNA viruses","synthetic tools","panel of isogenic","distinct serotypes","distinct genotypes","significant effects","disease enhancement","immune sera","setting","testing hypotheses","field-testing","temporal","infectious clones","residue changes","increased scrutiny","Aedes","Puerto Rico","Philippines","Sri Lanka","urgent need","mosquitoes","Cuba","immunopathogenesis","observed variability","vaccination","hypothesis","fold","Thailand"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably select antivirus masks and optimize the use of them for everyone. However, the uncertainty of the effects of COVID-19 and limits of human cognition add to the difficulty for decision makers to perfectly realize the purpose. To maximize the utility of the antivirus mask, we proposed a decision support algorithm based on the novel concept of the spherical normal fuzzy (SpNoF) set. In it, firstly, we analyzed the new score and accuracy function, improved operational rules, and their properties. Then, in line with these operations, we developed the SpNoF Bonferroni mean operator and the weighted Bonferroni mean operator, some properties of which are also examined. Furthermore, we established a multi-criteria decision-making method, based on the proposed operators, with SpNoF information. Finally, a numerical example on antivirus mask selection over the COVID-19 pandemic was given to verify the practicability of the proposed method, which the sensitive and comparative analysis was based on and was conducted to demonstrate the availability and superiority of our method.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Zaoli; Li, Xin; Garg, Harish; Qi, Meng","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414172/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103407","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SpNoF Bonferroni","Bonferroni"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed method","antivirus mask selection","antivirus mask shortages","SpNoF Bonferroni","antivirus masks","effects of COVID","SpNoF information","proposed operators","properties","rapid outbreak of COVID","weighted Bonferroni","decision makers","multi-criteria decision-making method","decision support algorithm","novel concept","accuracy function","operational rules","difficulty","limits of human cognition","set","numerical example","people","new score","pandemic","operations","practicability","comparative analysis","purpose","availability","superiority","uncertainty","use","utility","line"],"language":"en"},

Objective We conducted a prospective 12-month follow-up study of respiratory tract infections in 12 adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. Methods Nasal swab samples and induced sputum samples were taken at the onset of acute respiratory tract infection and every 3 months thereafter. Samples were tested for bacteria and viruses. PCR tests were performed for 15 respiratory tract viruses. In case the results for rhinovirus were positive, follow-up nasal swab samples were taken every 2 weeks until rhinoviral PCR results became negative. Patients completed symptom diaries, which were collected every month. The spouses of the patients served as healthy control subjects. Results During the 12-month period, the 12 patients had 65 episodes of acute respiratory tract infections, and the 11 spouses had 12 acute episodes (P \u003C .001). Respiratory tract viruses were found in sputum in 54% of the infections. Rhinovirus was the most common virus. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results stayed positive for more than 2 months. The most long-acting persistence with the same rhinovirus was 4 months. Conclusions Despite adequate immunoglobulin replacement therapy, patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract viral infections.

To date, the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22 animal species or families, including domestic, synantropic and wild animals, avian, and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. Astrovirus infections are considered among the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children, second only to rotavirus infections, but in animals their association with enteric diseases is not well documented, with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus infection. Genetic variability has been described in almost all astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds; however, antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses. Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increase the genetic variability of this group of viruses. A wide variety of species infected, the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co-infection of the same host with different astroviruses. This can also favor the emergence of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential. After more than 30 years from their first description in humans, there are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied Astroviridae family. In the present work, we will review the existing knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with particular focus on the molecular biology, interspecies transmission and zoonotic potential of this group of viruses.","publish_time":"2011-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Benedictis, Paola; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Burnham, Andrew; Cattoli, Giovanni","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/411c81f510c36549e0788c08491baae3ccf225ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843659/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811002796; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.07.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134811002796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["astrovirus species","Astrovirus infections","mammalian species","animal viruses","cross-species transmission","wild animals","mink astrovirus infection","wide variety of animals","human astroviruses","group of viruses","different astroviruses","Genetic variability","emergence of novel astroviruses infecting animals","list of animal species susceptible","wide variety of species infected","humans","co-infection","zoonotic potential","children","rotavirus infections","antigenic variability","evident virus genetic diversity","single-stranded RNA viruses","occurrence of recombination events","interspecies transmission","infecting mammals","increasing evidence of recombination events","subsequent virus adaptation","positive sense","molecular biology","new hosts","particular focus","synantropic","exception of turkey","birds","existing knowledge","enteric diseases","association","families","aquatic environments","exciting streams of research","common cause of gastroenteritis","under-studied Astroviridae family","date","intriguing questions","years","description","diarrhea","present work"],"language":"en"},

Increasing expression of tumor suppressor genes or inhibition of oncogenes in cancer cells has important therapeutic potential. However, several barriers impair progress in cancer gene delivery. These include effective delivery to cancer cells and relevant intracellular compartments. Although viral gene delivery can be effective, it has the disadvantages of being immuno-stimulatory, potentially mutagenic and lacking temporal control. Various nanoparticle (NP) platforms have been developed to overcome nucleic acid delivery hurdles, but several challenges still exist. One such challenge has been the accumulation of NPs in non-cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) as well as the circulation. While uptake by these cancer-associated cells is considered to be an off-target effect in some contexts, several strategies have now emerged to utilize NP-mediated gene delivery to intentionally alter the TME. For example, the similarity of NPs in shape and size to pathogens promotes uptake by antigen presenting cells, which can be used to increase immune stimulation and promote tumor killing by T-lymphocytes. In the era of immunotherapy, boosting the ability of the immune system to eliminate cancer cells has proven to be an exciting new area in cancer nanotechnology. Given the importance of cancer-associated cells in tumor growth and metastasis, targeting these cells in the TME opens up new therapeutic applications for NPs. This review will cover evidence for non-cancer cell accumulation of NPs in animal models and patients, summarize characteristics that promote NP delivery to different cell types, and describe several therapeutic strategies for gene modification within the TME.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Emily B.; Azam, Salma H.; Pecot, Chad V.","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa8f28950eb66ca369acb51e3cbb5b3ee178f82f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5893903.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","TME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer gene delivery","non-cancer cells","cancer-associated cells","cancer nanotechnology","importance of cancer","NP delivery","effective delivery","non-cancer cell accumulation of NPs","viral gene delivery","NP-mediated gene delivery","nucleic acid delivery hurdles","tumor growth","similarity of NPs","tumor microenvironment","therapeutic strategies","gene modification","new therapeutic applications","uptake","expression of tumor suppressor genes","important therapeutic potential","immune system","immune stimulation","different cell types","exciting new area","inhibition of oncogenes","animal models","size","characteristics","pathogens","shape","patients","evidence","relevant intracellular compartments","metastasis","extraordinary promise","ability","platforms","antigen","barriers","progress","contexts","disadvantages","Various nanoparticle","challenges","review","temporal control","target effect","T-lymphocytes","era of immunotherapy","example","circulation"],"language":"en"},

A total of 133 calves, enrolled at 24 \u2013 72 h of age, received a daily dose of 0.96 gm of egg yolk powder with anti-IL-10 antibodies (MAB, n = 71) or without anti-IL-10 antibodies (MEP, n = 62) split between 2 feedings for the first 11 d on feed at a calf ranch. Daily health evaluations were completed for 15 days after arrival and on d 56. Digital weights were collected at enrollment and d 56 and hipometer weights at enrollment, d 7 and 56. Packed cell volume and serum total protein concentration were measured at enrollment, d 7 and 14. Fecal pH was measured at enrollment, d 5 and 14, and fecal pathogen (C. parvum, coronavirus, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp) shedding was assessed at d 5 and 14. Continuous outcomes were compared between groups using a student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fecal pathogen shedding at d 14, respiratory disease at d 56, and antibiotic usage were compared using relative risk and chi square test. Fecal pH (median, IQR) on d 14 was 6.65 (6.39 \u2013 6.99) and 6.52 (5.97 \u2013 6.81) for MAB and MEP, respectively. On d 56, the risk of respiratory disease was lower for MAB compared to MEP (RR: 0.40; CI: 0.16 \u2013 0.99). The risk for antibiotic treatment was lower for MAB compared to MEP treated calves (RR = 0.38; CI: 0.17 \u2013 0.88). The risk of shedding rotavirus was higher in MAB (RR = 1.38; CI: 1.10 \u2013 1.81) calves.

Total health score, diarrhea days, average respiratory score, packed cell volume, and serum total protein were not affected by feeding anti-IL-10 egg antibodies. In summary, feeding anti-IL-10 antibodies was associated with increased fecal pH, reduced risk of respiratory disease later in the preweaning period, and decreased antibiotic usage despite higher rotavirus infection.

Infection usually leads to an acute, often lethal diarrhea in piglets. Despite the impact of the disease, no system is yet available to manipulate the viral genome which has severely hampered research on this virus until today. We have established a reverse genetics system for PEDV based on targeted RNA recombination that allows the modification of the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome, which encodes the structural proteins and the ORF3 protein. Using this system, we deleted the ORF3 gene entirely from the viral genome and showed that the ORF3 protein is not essential for replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, we inserted heterologous genes (i.e. the GFP and Renilla luciferase genes) at two positions in the viral genome, either as an extra expression cassette or as a replacement for the ORF3 gene. We demonstrated the expression of both GFP and Renilla luciferase as well as the application of these viruses by establishing a convenient and rapid virus neutralization assay. The new PEDV reverse genetics system will enable functional studies of the structural proteins and the accessory ORF3 protein and will allow the rational design and development of next generation PEDV vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chunhua; Li, Zhen; Zou, Yong; Wicht, Oliver; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

In order to save this species, the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context, a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral, one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis), and several bacterial (e.g., hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Do\u00F1ana and Sierra Morena areas, in Southern Spain, between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007, six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p\u003C0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx\u0027s habitats. Data available regarding the time frame, co-infections, and outcome of FeLV-infections suggest that, in contrast to the domestic cat, the FeLV strain affecting the lynxes in 2007 is highly virulent to this species. Our data argue strongly for vaccination of lynxes and domestic cats in and around lynx\u0027s habitats in order to prevent further spread of the virus as well as reduction the domestic cat population if the lynx population is to be maintained.","publish_time":"2009-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meli, Marina L.; Cattori, Valentino; Mart\u00EDnez, Fernando; L\u00F3pez, Guillermo; Vargas, Astrid; Sim\u00F3n, Miguel A.; Zorrilla, Irene; Mu\u00F1oz, Alvaro; Palomares, Francisco; L\u00F3pez-Bao, Jose V.; Pastor, Josep; Tandon, Ravi; Willi, Barbara; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084df43c5fc9b52ac507f090c6d892b69e5b0999.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2649436.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19270739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sierra Morena"],"locations":["Southern Spain"],"keyphrases":["FeLV infection","Iberian lynxes","outcome of FeLV","FeLV strain","vaccination of lynxes","FeLV p27 positive","Endogenous FeLV sequences","provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes","domestic cats","FeLV surface glycoprotein gene","viral infections","feline leukemia virus","tested feline pathogens","domestic cat population","lynx population","co-infections","prevalence of selected feline pathogens","exception of feline immunodeficiency virus","Lynx pardinus","evidence of infection","lynx\u0027s habitats","order","endangered felid species","Data available","Sierra Morena areas","FIV","captive breeding program","time frame","retrospective survey","common origin","Spanish authorities","Do\u00F1ana","Southern Spain","protozoan","Cytauxzoon felis","Sequencing","reduction","infectious agents","mortality","context","world","hemotropic mycoplasma","importance","animals","BACKGROUND","contrast","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","six-month period","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","samples","USA"],"language":"en"},

Methods Nasopharyngeal specimens from 100 HCPs were collected from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) during the winter and from 100 HCPs during the summer. All subjects were tested for 22 viruses and 19 bacteria using Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. Both seasonal cohorts were composed of students, nurses, physicians, and residents. Results Of the 100 HCPs tested during the winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and coronavirus were the most frequently detected potentially infectious agents. Of the 100 HCPs tested during the summer, 37 tested positive for at least 1 bacterium, and 4 tested positive for a viral agent. The most prevalent bacteria were MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. Conclusion Nasopharyngeal carriage among asymptomatic HCPs was common, but the frequency and presence of potential pathogens varied with each season. Understanding the colonization and infection potential of upper respiratory organisms is important, particularly for viruses. Although asymptomatic HCPs certainly harbor a number of different potentially infectious agents, future studies are needed to determine whether colonized pathogens are transmitted or initiate infection in at-risk patient populations.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassoun, Ali; Huff, Matthew D.; Weisman, David; Chahal, Khushdeep; Asis, Esmeralda; Stalons, Don; Grigorenko, Elena; Green, Jessica; Malone, Leslie L.; Clemmons, Scott; Lu, Stanley","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fe50dbad09e09a3624d119cb057b9c46da71391.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115326.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.04.195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26052103/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655315004617; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655315004617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":["Huntsville Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic HCPs","winter","viral organisms","MRSA","Methods Nasopharyngeal specimens","bacterium","infectious agents","viruses","colonized pathogens","summer months","subjects","Conclusion Nasopharyngeal carriage","presence of potential pathogens","infection potential of upper respiratory organisms","asymptomatic health care professionals","prevalent bacteria","Huntsville Hospital","viral agent","seasonal variance","seasonal cohorts","Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction","number of different","frequency","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","Moraxella catarrhalis","future studies","nurses","students","Klebsiella pneumonia","colonization","physicians","study","at-risk patient populations","residents","coronavirus","purpose","Results"],"language":"en"},

However, their limited immunogenicity has demanded potent adjuvants that can strengthen the immune response. Particulate nanocarriers hold a high potential as adjuvants in vaccination. Due to their pathogen-like size and structure, they can enhance immune responses by mimicking the natural infection process. Additionally, they can be tailored for non-invasive mucosal administration (needle-free vaccination), and control the delivery of the associated antigens to a specific location and for prolonged times, opening room for single-dose vaccination. Moreover, they allow co-association of immunostimulatory molecules to improve the overall adjuvant capacity. The natural and ubiquitous character of polysaccharides, together with their intrinsic immunomodulating properties, their biocompatibility, and biodegradability, justify their interest in the engineering of nanovaccines. In this review, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art overview regarding the application of nanotechnology in vaccine delivery, with a focus on the most recent advances in the development and application of polysaccharide-based antigen nanocarriers.","publish_time":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cordeiro, Ana Sara; Alonso, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; de la Fuente, Mar\u00EDa","journal":"Biotechnol Adv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae90c817f26e02354fbc4944059f132f32395285.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127432.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975015300094; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0734975015300094; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.05.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26049133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development","needle-free vaccination","single-dose vaccination","Important biotechnological advances","application of nanotechnology","application of polysaccharide","associated antigens","potent adjuvants","recent advances","immune responses","Particulate nanocarriers","vaccine delivery","licensed vaccines","important challenges","safer subunit antigens","non-invasive mucosal administration","based antigen nanocarriers","natural infection process","thermo-resistant vaccines","proteins","prolonged times","specific location","room","high potential","co-association of immunostimulatory molecules","biocompatibility","intrinsic immunomodulating properties","pathogenesis","structure","peptides","focus","overall adjuvant capacity","ubiquitous character of polysaccharides","nucleic acids","limited immunogenicity","state-of-the-art overview","area","viruses","bacteria","size","biodegradability","engineering of nanovaccines","review"],"language":"en"},

Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and polymerase-chain reaction increase the ability to identify viral pathogens and may ultimately impact antibacterial use. METHOD: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of antibacterials in viral pneumonia on clinical outcomes and subsequent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections/colonization. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with positive respiratory viral panels (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia were included. Patients transferred from an outside hospital or not still hospitalized 72 hours after the RVP report date were excluded. Patients were categorized based on exposure to systemic antibacterials: less than 3 days representing short-course therapy and 3 to 10 days being long-course therapy. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients (long-course, n = 67; short-course, n = 28; mixed bacterial-viral infection, n = 79) were included with most being immunocompromised (56.3 %) with active malignancy the primary etiology (69.4 %). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (23 %), Influenza (19 %), and Parainfluenza (15.5 %) were the viruses most commonly identified. A total of 13 different systemic antibacterials were used as empiric therapy in the 95 patients with pure viral infection for a total of 466 days-of-therapy. Vancomycin (50.7 %), cefepime (40.3 %), azithromycin (40.3 %), meropenem (23.9 %), and linezolid (20.9 %) were most frequently used. In-hospital mortality did not differ between patients with viral pneumonia in the short-course and long-course groups. Subsequent infection/colonization with a MDRO was more frequent in the long-course group compared to the short-course group (53.2 vs 21.1 %; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study found that long-course antibacterial use in the setting of viral pneumonia had no impact on clinical outcomes but increased the incidence of subsequent MDRO infection/colonization.","publish_time":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crotty, Matthew P.; Meyers, Shelby; Hampton, Nicholas; Bledsoe, Stephanie; Ritchie, David J.; Buller, Richard S.; Storch, Gregory A.; Kollef, Marin H.; Micek, Scott T.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c3be5c1501f68e5305325f4acac221632ccb290.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4650137.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-015-1120-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["short-course therapy","long-course group","short-course group","course groups","hospitalized patients","setting of viral pneumonia","course antibacterial use","viral pathogens","pure viral infection","Subsequent infection","mixed bacterial-viral infection","impact of antibacterials","days","colonization","total","incidence of subsequent MDRO infection","positive respiratory viral panels","empiric therapy","significant etiologies of pneumonia","radiographic findings of pneumonia","clinical outcomes","different systemic antibacterials","Respiratory viruses","subsequent multidrug-resistant organism","outside hospital","hospital mortality","RVP report date","single-center retrospective cohort study","multiplex molecular assays","polymerase-chain reaction","ability","Advanced technologies","hours","infections","vs","active malignancy","primary etiology","exposure","Enterovirus","cefepime","azithromycin","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","Rhinovirus","Vancomycin","meropenem","METHOD","CONCLUSION","Parainfluenza","linezolid"],"language":"en"},

The interplay of these inflammatory mediators and switching of immune responses during hepatotoxic, viral, drug-induced and immune cell-mediated hepatitis decide the fate of liver pathology. The present review aimed to describe the mechanisms of liver injury, its relevance to human liver pathology and insights for the future therapeutic interventions. Data sources The data of mouse hepatic models and relevant human liver diseases presented in this review are systematically collected from PubMed, ScienceDirect and the Web of Science databases published in English. Results The hepatotoxic liver injury in mice induced by the metabolites of CCl4, acetaminophen or alcohol represent necrotic cell death with activation of cytochrome pathway, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial damage. The Fas or TNF-\u03B1 induced apoptotic liver injury was dependent on activation of caspases, release of cytochrome c and apoptosome formation. The ConA-hepatitis demonstrated the involvement of TRAIL-dependent necrotic/necroptotic cell death with activation of RIPK1/3. The \u03B1-GalCer-induced liver injury was mediated by TNF-\u03B1. The LPS-induced hepatitis involved TNF-\u03B1, Fas/FasL, and perforin/granzyme cell death pathways. The MHV3 or Poly(I:C) induced liver injury was mediated by natural killer cells and TNF-\u03B1 signaling. The necrotic ischemia-reperfusion liver injury was mediated by hypoxia, ROS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines; however, necroptotic cell death was found in partial hepatectomy. The crucial role of immune cells and cell death mediators in viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), drug-induced liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease in human were discussed. Conclusions The mouse animal models of hepatitis provide a parallel approach for the study of human liver pathology. Blocking or stimulating the pathways associated with liver cell death could unveil the novel therapeutic strategies in the management of liver diseases.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Hilal Ahmad; Ahmad, Muhammad Zishan; Khan, Junaid Ali; Arshad, Muhammad Imran","journal":"Hepatobiliary \u0026 Pancreatic Diseases International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/938d407aa38be51c6b93195b3841da37b60ed251.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499387217600146; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1499387217600146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liver cell death","hepatotoxic liver injury","apoptotic liver injury","mechanisms of liver injury","drug-induced liver injury","fate of liver pathology","alcoholic liver disease","management of liver diseases","necrotic cell death","study of human liver pathology","Background Liver inflammation","relevant human liver diseases","necroptotic cell death","cell death mediators","necrotic ischemia-reperfusion liver injury","immune cell-mediated hepatitis","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","LPS-induced hepatitis","granzyme cell death pathways","TNF-\u03B1","viral hepatitis","ConA-hepatitis","result of pluripotent interactions of cell death molecules","\u03B1-GalCer","mouse animal models of hepatitis","resident immune cells","immune responses","crucial role of immune cells","activation of cytochrome pathway","activation of caspases","activation of RIPK1","ROS","inflammatory mediators","data of mouse hepatic models","release of cytochrome c","pro-inflammatory cytokines","natural killer cells","apoptosome formation","Data sources","present review","novel therapeutic strategies","future therapeutic interventions","formation of reactive oxygen species","insights","chemokines","relevance","acetaminophen","parallel approach","perforin","hypoxia","FasL","HBV","HCV","involvement of TRAIL","metabolites of CCl4","mice","Web of Science databases","ScienceDirect","Conclusions","mitochondrial damage","partial hepatectomy","English","PubMed","microenvironment","MHV3","Poly","interplay"],"language":"en"},

Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli \u002B Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, L.; Andr\u00E9s, S.; S\u00E1nchez, J.; Alonso, J.

A commercial BVD vaccine is the likely source of alloantigens eliciting BNP associated alloantibodies. We hypothesized that the rare occurrence of BNP in calves born to vaccinated dams could be associated with genetic differences within dams and calves. We found that the development of BNP within calves was a heritable trait for dams, not for calves and had a high heritability of 19%. To elucidate which genes play a role in the development of BNP we sequenced candidate genes and characterized BNP alloantibodies. Alloantigens present in the vaccine have to be presented to the dam\u2019s immune system via MHC class II, however sequencing of DRB3 showed no differences in MHC class II haplotype between BNP and non-BNP dams. MHC class I, a highly polymorphic alloantigen, is an important target of BNP alloantibodies. Using a novel sequence based MHC class I typing method, we found no association of BNP with MHC class I haplotype distribution in dams or calves. Alloantibodies were detected in both vaccinated BNP and non-BNP dams and we found no differences in alloantibody characteristics between these groups, but alloantibody levels were significantly higher in BNP dams. We concluded that the development of BNP in calves is a heritable trait of the dam rather than the calf and genetic differences between BNP and non-BNP dams are likely due to genes controlling the quantitative alloantibody response following vaccination.

Newer techniques enhance that information and the time interval for obtaining results. An audit of diagnostic microbiology utilisation, microbiological aetiology, and influence of results on prescribing practices in CAP in a regional Australian hospital setting was performed. Methods Clinical, microbiological and outcome data were collected by medical record review of patients discharged from Ballarat Hospital with a diagnosis of CAP over a 12 month period. Results Of 184 identified CAP episodes, 47 (25.5%) had no diagnostic microbiology performed. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was rarely performed (2.7% of all episodes). Acute serology was frequently requested, however paired acute and convalescent serology was infrequently performed (5/75 testing episodes; 6.7%). CAP severity was not correlated with microbiological investigation intensity. The most common pathogens identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5.4% and 2.2%, respectively). Diagnostic testing appeared to rarely influence antimicrobial prescribing. Conclusions In this setting, diagnostic microbiological tests such as respiratory virus PCR and urinary antigen tests are under-utilised. In contrast, sputum and serological investigations are commonly requested, however rarely influence practice. Interventions to facilitate efficient usage of diagnostic microbiology are required.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeremiah, Cameron J.; Hannan, Liam M.; Baird, Rob; Phelps, Grant; Knight, Brett","journal":"Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/957b3c0a12d6203b6e47a7e73ddc4af810d83290.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23250034/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031302516315811; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031302516315811; https://doi.org/10.1097/pat.0b013e32835c76be","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic microbiological tests","Diagnostic testing","identified CAP episodes","diagnosis of CAP","CAP severity","audit of diagnostic microbiology utilisation","efficient usage of diagnostic microbiology","influence of results","microbiological aetiology","testing episodes","respiratory virus PCR","microbiological investigation intensity","Acute serology","useful information","Ballarat Hospital","regional Australian hospital setting","Streptococcus pneumoniae","prescribing practices","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","antimicrobial prescribing","convalescent serology","Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction","urinary antigen tests","patient management","infection control","outcome data","medical record review of patients","community","epidemiological surveillance","Methods Clinical","common pathogens","time interval","contrast","sputum","serological investigations","Interventions","Summary","Conclusions","Newer techniques","month period"],"language":"en"},

On the other hand, it is accepted that DexD/H-box helicases also engage in activities that do not require helicase activity. A number of DExD/H-box helicases have been shown to be involved in anti-viral immunity. The RIG-like helicases, RIG-I, mda5 and lgp2, act as important cytosolic pattern recognition receptors for viral RNA. Detection of viral nucleic acids by the RIG-like helicases or other anti-viral pattern recognition receptors leads to the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. More recently, additional DExD/H-box helicases have also been implicated to act as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids, including DDX3, DDX41, DHX9, DDX60, DDX1 and DHX36. However, there is evidence that at least some of these helicases might have more downstream functions in pattern recognition receptor signalling pathways, as signalling adaptors or transcriptional regulators. In an interesting twist, a lot of DExD/H-box helicases have also been identified as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses, suggesting that viruses \u2018hijack\u2019 their RNA helicase activities for their benefit. Interestingly, DDX3, DDX1 and DHX9 are among the helicases that are required for the replication of a diverse range of viruses.

However, the link between IL-33 and type-2 inflammation has not been shown in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: To determine if airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 inflammation measured by type-2 cytokines, FeNO and sputum eosinophils in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbations. METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized due to acute asthma were enrolled. Upper airways were sampled with nasal swabs and lower airways with induced sputum. Cytokines were measured at protein level using a Luminex(\u00AE) assay and mRNA expression level using droplet-digital-PCR. Airway sampling was repeated four weeks after exacerbation. RESULTS: At the time of exacerbation, upper airway IL-33 correlated with upper airway IL-5 and IL-13 (R = 0.84, p \u003C 0.01 and R = 0.76, p \u003C 0.01, respectively) and with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.49, p = 0.03). Similar associations were observed for mRNA expression. Lower airway IL-33 positively correlated with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.84, p \u003C 0.01). IL-13 and IL-33 were positively correlated with FeNO, and IL-5 with eosinophils. The association between IL-33 and type-2 cytokines were still present four weeks after exacerbation. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 cytokines in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations in adults, providing in vivo evidence supporting that IL-33 may be driving type-2 inflammation in acute asthma. Thus supporting IL-33 as a potential future drug target due to its role, upstream in the immunological cascade.","publish_time":"2018-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poulsen, Nadia Nicholine; Bjerregaard, Asger; Khoo, Siew-Kim; Laing, Ingrid A.; Le Sou\u00EBf, Peter; Backer, Vibeke; Rapley, Laura; Cohen, Suzanne E.; Barrett, Lucy; Thompson, Philip; Baltic, Svetlana; Porsbjerg, Celeste","journal":"Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe00f479396b82f2ab95abadb67f2c7881bb0776.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172141.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611118301781; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611118301781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29957280/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2018.05.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower airway IL","upper airway IL","type","Airway sampling","acute asthma","asthma exacerbations","cytokines","inflammation","lower airways","Upper airways","mRNA expression level","Adult patients","sputum eosinophils","time of exacerbation","weeks","FeNO","inoculation study","induced sputum","protein level","adult asthmatics","nasal swabs","droplet-digital","role","assay","Emergency Department","potential future drug target","animal studies","Luminex","PCR","Similar associations","adults","interleukin","evidence","major contributor","immunological cascade","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","link","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Since implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) is known to reduce the risk of disease transmission, the objective of this study was to describe the pig farming management system as well as the biosecurity practices on pig farms in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Therefore, 97 farms were investigated using a face\u2010to\u2010face interview\u2010based questionnaire. Biosecurity practices were divided in three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation. The results revealed that the majority of farms were extensive (73.22%), farrow\u2010to\u2010finish farms (59.79%) and essentially raising crossed\u2010bred (72.75%). The most practiced BM regarding \u2018isolation\u2019 were as follows: maintenance of the minimum distance between farms (56.06%) and dispatching of animals of same age in the same room (97.16%); for \u2018traffic control\u2019, the measures included the following: assignment of specific tools and equipment (96.86%) to a specific piggery; concerning \u2018sanitation\u2019, daily cleaning (97.06%), as well as using disinfectants (89.13%) were mostly implemented. The measures less implemented for \u2018isolation\u2019 included fencing (11.83%), compliance with the all\u2010in all\u2010out principle (10.11%), use of specific clothing (6.03%) and quarantine (7.69%); for \u2018traffic control\u2019, the less adopted measures comprised visitor hands washed before animal handling (11.65%), respect of linear flow principle (13.52%). Concerning \u2018sanitation\u2019, these measures included functional footbath (29.90%), processing of drinking water (27.84%) and cleanout (18.14%). The biosecurity level was low, intermediate and high for 73.71, 21.55 and 4.73% of farms, respectively. This low level suggests that ASF and other diseases are likely to remain endemic. The most important measures of concern and to improve are as follows: not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barn; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kouam, Marc K.; Jacouba, Manjeli; Moussala, Junior O.","journal":"Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c83b149dc7f5339bd3efa3128d991bb9b802b909.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7036310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682081/; https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.211","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASF"],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["pig farms","implementation of biosecurity measures","adopted measures","majority of farms","finish farms","biosecurity level","biosecurity practices","sanitation","isolation","traffic control","important measures of concern","fencing pig barn","future of pig industry","pigs","ASF","Western Highlands of Cameroon","arrived animals","low level","sick animals","specific clothing","specific piggery","quarantine","pig farming management system","assignment of specific tools","parasitic diseases","practiced BM","all\u2010in all\u2010out principle","respect of linear flow principle","erysipelas","visitor hands","livestock species","components","objective","animal handling","study","compliance","face\u2010to\u2010face interview","maintenance","following","boars","African swine fever","risk of disease transmission","based questionnaire","equipment","farrow","minimum distance","functional footbath","processing of drinking water","kitchen waste","daily cleaning","results","room","cleanout","disinfectants"],"language":"en"},

In this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics, the incidence and outcome of HSCT recipients who are hospitalized with RVI (H-RVI) are not well described. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients (between January 2010 and June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Their medical charts were reviewed for H-RVI events within 1 year after their transplant. An H-RVI diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection (human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of H-RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline HSCT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. RESULTS: Among 1560 HSCT recipients, 259 (16.6%) acquired at least 1 H-RVI within 1 year after their transplant. The median age of the patients with an H-RVI was lower than that of patients without an H-RVI (4.8 vs 7.1 years; P \u003C .001). Among the patients with a first H-RVI, 48% required some respiratory support, and 14% suffered significant pulmonary sequelae. The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of H-RVI onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that H-RVI onset within 60 days of HSCT, steroid use in the 7 days before H-RVI onset, and the need for respiratory support at H-RVI onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. CONCLUSION: Results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that H-RVIs are relatively common in pediatric HSCT recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death. These data should help inform interventional studies specific to each viral pathogen.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Brian T; Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Sweet, Leigh R; Munoz, Flor M; Maron, Gabriela; Tuomanen, Elaine; Murray, Alistair; Englund, Janet A; Dulek, Daniel; Halasa, Natasha; Green, Michael; Michaels, Marian G; Madan, Rebecca Pellett; Herold, Betsy C; Steinbach, William J","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e589559db60e302b6b89f8793cef61207496b07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107490.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pix051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29106589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H-RVI onset","H-RVI diagnosis","H-RVI events","H-RVIs","incidence of H","months of H","days of HSCT","outcome of HSCT recipients","respiratory support","respiratory signs","retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients","patients","death","Respiratory virus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","association of baseline HSCT factors","subsequent morbidity","significant morbidity","US pediatric transplant centers","RESULTS","subsequent pulmonary complications","significant pulmonary sequelae","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","viral detection","viral pathogen","multicenter cohort study","symptoms","enterovirus","children","threat","attributable case-fatality rates","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","interventional studies specific","coronaviruses","need","all-cause","steroid use","era of sensitive molecular diagnostics","parainfluenza","BACKGROUND","Multivariate logistic regression","vs","data","METHODS","CONCLUSION","years","median age","medical charts"],"language":"en"},

To track the behavior of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in the infected cells in real time, we produced an infectious recombinant ASFV (B54GFP-2) that expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p54 envelope protein fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The incorporation of the fusion protein into the virus particle was confirmed immunologically and it was determined that p54-EGFP was fully functional by confirmation that the recombinant virus made normal-sized plaques and presented similar growth curves to the wild-type virus. The tagged virus was visualized as individual fluorescent particles during the first stages of infection and allowed to visualize the infection progression in living cells through the viral life cycle by confocal microscopy. In this work, diverse potential applications of B54GFP-2 to study different aspects of ASFV infection are shown. By using this recombinant virus it was possible to determine the trajectory and speed of intracellular virus movement. Additionally, we have been able to visualize for first time the ASFV factory formation dynamics and the cytophatic effect of the virus in live infected cells.

A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5\u2019-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from diverse locations.","publish_time":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hause, Ben M.; Collin, Emily A.; Anderson, Joe; Hesse, Richard A.; Anderson, Gary","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c98b61b984da63b53eeef9f81e31a5ee79396b1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4366061.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25789939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRBV"],"locations":["U.S.","England"],"keyphrases":["Bovine rhinitis viruses","BRBV genomes","BRBV infections","bovine rhinitis B virus","complete BRAV2","BRBV co-","mixed BRAV1","near complete genome of bovine rhinitis","etiological agents of bovine respiratory disease complex","cattle","BRV infections","positive samples","Metagenomic sequencing","reference genomes","nucleotide similarity","Seroprevalence studies","high similarity","molecular epidemiological studies","immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies","archived BRD clinical specimens","nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay","little research","diagnostic submission","cell culture","nasal swab","templated assemblies","novo","contigs","ecology","epidemiology","D polymerase gene","Kansas","historical isolate","combination","years","herds","results","diverse locations","England","Japan","decades"],"language":"en"},

Dromedaries are the source of human zoonotic infection. MERS-CoV is enzootic among dromedaries on the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East and in Africa. Over 70% of infected dromedaries are found in Africa. However, all known zoonotic cases of MERS have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula with none being reported in Africa. AIM: We aimed to investigate serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in humans living in camel-herding areas in Morocco to provide insights on whether zoonotic transmission is taking place. METHODS: We carried out a cross sectional seroprevalence study from November 2017 through January 2018. We adapted a generic World Health Organization MERS-CoV questionnaire and protocol to assess demographic and risk factors of infection among a presumed high-risk population. ELISA, MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralisation tests (ppNT) and plaque neutralisation tests (PRNT) were used to assess MERS-CoV seropositivity. RESULTS: Serum samples were collected from camel slaughterhouse workers (n = 137), camel herders (n = 156) and individuals of the general population without occupational contact with camels but living in camel herding areas (n = 186). MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies with \u2265 90% reduction of plaque numbers were detected in two (1.5%) slaughterhouse workers, none of the camel herders and one individual from the general population (0.5%).

We examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date, and discover that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e. taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity.

We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.","publish_time":"2012-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Burghgraeve, Tine; Kaptein, Suzanne J.

The illnesses vary from relatively mild common colds caused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by adenoviruses and influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants: the former is associated with little morbidity and no mortality, while influenza is responsible annually for between 1 and 25 thousand deaths per 50 million population. Over 140 viruses cause respiratory tract infections, with the added complications of influenza viruses where new antigenic variants are recognized almost annually; and immunity to infection by one virus strain offers little or no protection to infection by others. Knowledge of the mechanisms of spread of respiratory viruses is largely understood and has helped in infection control; however, the clinical signs and symptoms of infection tend not to be diagnostic of the causative agent; and although vaccines have been developed for the more serious infections such as influenza and some adenovirus infection, none are available for other important infections. Treatment is largely symptomatic, but the compounds ribovirin for RSV infection and amantadine for influenza virus infection have been shown to be effective. Much remains to be discovered before more effective measures can be implemented to limit the enormous costs incurred by these infections. The number of viruses involved is large, and the spectrum of illness complex: in the present chapter, the viruses are described, together with the features of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical disease, and treatment.","publish_time":"1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Potter, Christopher William","journal":"Principles of Medical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8b460803a056b8f342f72d28ebaab7e1a2d0bef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1569258297800098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569258297800098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","respiratory viruses","RSV infection","adenovirus infection","infection control","symptoms of infection","number of viruses","important infections","serious infections","added complications of influenza viruses","Summary Respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","virus strain","Treatment","clinical disease","clinical signs","commonest of illnesses","little morbidity","effective measures","adenoviruses","amantadine","rhinoviruses","coronaviruses","pneumonia","severe bronchiolitis","pathogenesis","compounds ribovirin","new antigenic variants","mild common colds","spectrum of illness complex","epidemiology","present chapter","mortality","protection","causative agent","infants","individuals","immunity","mechanisms","vaccines","features","year","lives","enormous costs","deaths","population","Knowledge","remains"],"language":"en"},

Very little is known about such aerosol dissemination or the means for minimizing exposure to these aerosols. This study has evaluated the efficacy of ultraviolet waveband C (UV-C) for disinfection of flushing-generated pathogen-laden aerosols through tests with localized disinfection systems for airborne and surface contaminations. Three types of bacteria were chosen for investigation: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. Tests were conducted with UV-C tubes of 5 W and 10 W. High levels of disinfection efficacies were observed, ranging from 76% to 97% for bacteria-laden aerosols at sources of emission, and efficiencies of 53% to 79% for surface samples in localized systems. The results from the localized systems were further compared with those obtained with an upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) system. As it is important to note, the UV-C doses and ozone emissions for the localized systems were found well below the limits recommended in current guidelines. This research has shown that the disinfection of flushing-generated pathogen-laden aerosols in proximity to the source of emission was more effective than at the more distant sites where aerosols may be dispersed to the environment.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, A.C.K.; Nunayon, S.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how HRV-C is associated with respiratory illness and to evaluate changes in prevalence and species over 2 decades. METHODS: A prospective study of children younger than 5 years was performed at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic over a 21-year period. Nasal-wash specimens from children presenting with upper or lower respiratory illness at acute care visits were tested for HRV and HRV-positives genotyped. Demographic and clinical features were compared between children with or without HRV, and with different HRV species. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 190 of 527 (36%) specimens from a population of 2009 children from 1982 through 2003. Of these, 36% were HRV-C. Age (P = .039) and month of illness (P \u003C.001) were associated with HRV infection and HRV species. HRV-C was significantly associated with lower respiratory illness, compared with HRV-A (P = .014). HRV-A and HRV-C prevalence fluctuated throughout the 21-year period; HRV-C was more prevalent during winter (P = .058). CONCLUSIONS: HRV-C is not a new virus but has been significantly associated with childhood lower respiratory illness in this population for several decades.

When applied to virus samples of known virus titer for the highly pathogenic ISAV strain NBISA01 and the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1, both methods showed a 100-fold lower detectable titer for RPC/NB-04-085-1 but with a higher number of viral RNA molecules compared to NBISA01. Overall, the SYBR\u00AE Green I method overestimated copy numbers in samples having equivalent Ct values with the TaqMan\u00AE probe method.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.

Here, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a system to identify novel functional interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. Our work demonstrates that when the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a accessory gene is expressed in yeast it causes a slow-growth phenotype. ORF4a has been characterized as an interferon antagonist in mammalian cells, and yet yeast lack an interferon system, suggesting further interactions between ORF4a and eukaryotic cells. Using the slow-growth phenotype as a reporter of ORF4a function, we utilized the yeast knockout library collection to perform a suppressor screen where we identified the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene as a suppressor of ORF4a function. The mammalian homologue of SIR2 is SIRT1, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. We found that when SIRT1 was inhibited by either chemical or genetic manipulation, there was reduced MERS-CoV replication, suggesting that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV. Moreover, ORF4a inhibited SIRT1-mediated modulation of NF-\u03BAB signaling, demonstrating a functional link between ORF4a and SIRT1 in mammalian cells. Overall, the data presented here demonstrate the utility of yeast studies for identifying genetic interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. We also demonstrate for the first time that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV replication and that ORF4a has a role in modulating its activity in cells.

Several types of macrophages play a central role in the response to infectious agents and, along with other components of the immune system, determine the clinical outcome of major infectious diseases. Here, we review the functions of various macrophage phenotypic subpopulations, the concept of macrophage polarization, and the influence of these cells on the evolution of infections. In addition, we emphasize their role in the immune response in vivo and in situ, as well as the molecular effectors and signaling mechanisms used by these cells. Furthermore, we highlight the mechanisms of immune evasion triggered by infectious agents to counter the actions of macrophages and their consequences.

The participants reported a significantly increasing virus anxiety in recent months (previous months recorded retrospectively), especially among individuals with heightened trait health anxiety. CyberchondriaPandemic showed positive correlations with current virus anxiety (r = .09 \u2013 .48), and this relationship was additionally moderated by trait health anxiety. A negative correlation was found between the perception of being informed about the pandemic and the current virus anxiety (r=-.18), with adaptive emotion regulation being a significant moderator for this relationship. The findings suggest that trait health anxiety and cyberchondria serve as risk factors, whereas information about the pandemic and adaptive emotion regulation might represent buffering factors for anxiety during a virus pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jungmann, Stefanie M.; Witth\u00F6ft, Michael","journal":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaf85b2f20387cbfaedad957771f90b4bbae1709.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300530?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887618520300530; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current virus anxiety","context of virus anxiety","maintenance of health anxiety","role of trait health anxiety","heightened trait health anxiety","virus pandemic","virus outbreaks","adaptive emotion regulation","cyberchondriaPandemic","current COVID","relationship","buffering factors","risk factors","excessive online information search","pivotal role","recent months","previous months","online survey","events","positive correlations","traits","adverse behaviors","significant moderator","development","cognitive-behavioral models","German general population","SARS-CoV","female","cognitions","individuals","SD","age","years","perception","questionnaires","findings","negative correlation","participants"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this work was to evaluate the epidemiology characteristics of respiratory viruses found in children and adults with RTI from July 2009 to June 2012 in southern China. Methods In this work, a total of 14 237 nasopharyngeal swabs (14 237 patients from 25 hospitals) were analyzed, and seven respiratory viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus) were detected using PCR/RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results The demographic characteristics, viral prevalence, age distribution, seasonal distribution, and pathogen spectrum of the patients with RTIs were analyzed. Co-infection was observed in 483 specimens, but it was more common in male patients, inpatients, children, and young adults. It varied by season, being more prevalent in the spring and summer and less so in the winter. Human coronavirus and human bocavirus were the most common pathogens, tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Conclusions This work adds to our knowledge of the epidemiology characteristics of these seven common respiratory viruses among patients with RTI in southern China. The detection of the specific viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness attributable to respiratory infection, and might also provide data relevant to the development of prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Dingmei; He, Zhenjian; Xu, Lin; Zhu, Xun; Wu, Jueheng; Wen, Weitao; Zheng, Yun; Deng, Yu; Chen, Jieling; Hu, Yiwen; Li, Mengfeng; Cao, Kaiyuan","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec3aa6e4db639e10c2589f6d371e07d50bf9b6dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110535.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214014581; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.02.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214014581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["southern China"],"keyphrases":["respiratory infection","common respiratory viruses","respiratory tract infection","epidemiology characteristics of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","human bocavirus","human coronavirus","Co-infection","human metapneumovirus","children","work","male patients","specific viral causes of infection","parainfluenza virus","age distribution","demographic characteristics","common pathogens","nasopharyngeal swabs","southern China","seasonal distribution","viral prevalence","RT-PCR","years of age","young adults","adenovirus","useful starting point","understanding of illness attributable","inpatients","pathogen spectrum","World Health Organization","Summary Background","data relevant","leading cause of death","total","development of prevention strategies","summer","detection","RTIs","knowledge","specimens","spring","Methods","hospitals","winter","Conclusions","aim"],"language":"en"},

Nasopharyngeal specimens of patients with respiratory symptoms were analyzed for CoV-HKU1 by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel multiplex assay from February 7, 2016 to April 30, 2016. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected on adults (patients \u003E18 years) whose samples screened positive. RESULTS. Of 832 adult respiratory specimens screened, 13 (1.6%) cases of CoV-HKU1 were identified. Adults age ranged between 23 and 75 years and 6 (46%) were males. All of whom had 1 or more respiratory symptoms, and 5 (38%) also reported 1 or more gastrointestinal symptoms. Eleven (85%) reported history of smoking and 5 (38%) used inhaled steroids. Seven (54%) required hospitalization, 5 (71%) of these needed supplemental oxygen, and 2 (29%) were admitted to intensive care. Median length of hospitalization was 5 days. Eight (62%) received antibiotics despite identification of CoV-HKU1. Infectious work-up in 1 patient who died did not reveal any other pathogen.

We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable microchamber devices, leading to the specific identification of as few as 0.4 infectious viral genome copies, with no cross-reaction to the other acute respiratory disease viruses, including influenza type A (H1N1 and H3N2), type B, human coronavirus 229E, and human metapneumovirus. This sensitive, specific and feasible method provides a large-scale technical support in emergencies, and is also applied as a sample-to-detection module in Point of Care Testing devices.","publish_time":"2017-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Se Hee; Baek, Yun Hee; Kim, Yang-Hoon; Choi, Young-Ki; Song, Min-Suk; Ahn, Ji-Young","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aea4f0b8aaacfac3d0d3b49bd7558481da9b03f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5220095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119682/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.02166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR green I.

Viruses were previously defined by their submicroscopic size, which probably prevented the search for giant viruses, which are visible by light microscopy. Extended studies of giant viruses of amoebae revealed that they have genetic, proteomic and structural complexities that were not thought to exist among viruses and that are comparable to those of bacteria, archaea and small eukaryotes. The giant virus particles contain mRNA and more than 100 proteins, they have gene repertoires that are broader than those of other viruses and, notably, some encode translation components. The infection cycles of giant viruses of amoebae involve virus entry by amoebal phagocytosis and replication in viral factories. In addition, mimiviruses are infected by virophages, defend against them through the mimivirus virophage resistance element (MIMIVIRE) system and have a unique mobilome. Overall, giant viruses of amoebae, including mimiviruses, marseilleviruses, pandoraviruses, pithoviruses, faustoviruses and molliviruses, challenge the definition and classification of viruses, and have increasingly been detected in humans.

Chloroquine has also been used as anti-inflammatory drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: chloroquine on the one hand could protect the liver against I/R injury via inhibition of inflammatory response, but on the other hand could aggravate liver I/R injury through inhibition of autophagy. Rats (n=6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0\u20136 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24\u201348 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase. In conclusion, chloroquine prevents ischemic liver damage at the early phase, but aggravates liver damage at the late phase in liver I/R injury. This dual role of chloroquine should be considered when using chloroquine as an inhibitor of inflammation or autophagy in I/R injury.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, H; Liu, A; Dahmen, U; Dirsch, O","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b1dd68a2de5fb4b3902e834ecc2fb6bd12f28f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3702304.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23807223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chloroquine worsened liver injury","chloroquine treatment","liver ischemia","dual role of chloroquine","daily chloroquine injection","late phase of reperfusion","ischemic liver damage","anti-malaria drug chloroquine","mechanism of protective action of chloroquine","inhibition of autophagy","early phase","autophagy inhibitor","inhibition of inflammatory response","lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines","inflammatory diseases","inflammatory cytokines production","hand","Rats","dual effect","warm ischemia","inhibitor of inflammation","induction of hepatic apoptosis","lower serum aminotransferase levels","high-mobility group box","release","mitogen-activated protein kinase activation","fewer histopathologic changes","ability","conclusion","contrast","anti-inflammatory drugs","days"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 78 consecutive adult SARS patients admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong between March and May 2003 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and clinical outcomes. Established adverse prognostic factors including old age, comorbidities and high LDH levels were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effect on adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Among 78 patients, 66 patients (84.6%) received corticosteroid. The LDH level was similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (37.9% vs. 16.7%) despite younger age and less comorbidity. In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 20.7-fold increase in risk of either ICU admission or mortality, independent of age and disease severity. CONCLUSION: Despite more favourable baseline characteristics and similar peak LDH levels, SARS patients given corticosteroid had more adverse outcomes.","publish_time":"2004-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Auyeung, Tung Wai; Lee, Jenny S.W.; Lai, Wing Kin; Choi, Chun Hung; Lee, Hoi Kan; Lee, Joo Shim; Li, Po Chun; Lok, Ka Ho; Ng, Yuk Yung; Wong, Wai Ming; Yeung, Yiu Ming","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52f5440ec7a22706f95be3c6f5e0ed2e940e4945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132384.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445304002294; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445304002294","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ICU"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["adverse outcomes","corticosteroid treatment","corticosteroid group","effectiveness of corticosteroid","corticosteroid therapy","similar peak LDH levels","high LDH levels","clinical outcomes","consecutive adult SARS patients","comorbidities","old age","independent of age","younger age","adverse prognostic factors","confounding effect","effect of corticosteroids","peak lactate dehydrogenase","favourable baseline characteristics","terms of demographic characteristics","treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome","ICU admission","mortality","covariates","retrospective cohort","regional hospital","risk","multiple logistic regressions","fold increase","disease severity","Hong Kong","CONCLUSION","groups","multivariate analysis","METHODS","comorbidity","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs. Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a species rather than PPIs across different species such as PPIs between virus and host. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a prediction model of virus-host PPIs, which is applicable to new viruses and hosts. We tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs, which were not used in training the model. Despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets and target proteins in test datasets, the prediction model showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs. CONCLUSIONS: Our method will be particularly useful to find PPIs between host and new viruses for which little information is available.

In the present study, a novel EV\u2010G strain (KOR/KNU\u20101811/2018) that resulted from cross\u2010order recombination was discovered in diagnostic faecal samples from neonatal pigs with diarrhoea that were negative for swine enteric coronaviruses and rotavirus. The recombinant EV\u2010G genome possessed an exogenous 594\u2010nucleotide (198\u2010amino acid) sequence, flanked by two viral 3C(pro) cleavage sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends in its 2C/3A junction region. This insertion encoded a predicted protease similar to the porcine torovirus papain\u2010like cysteine protease (PLCP), which was recently found in the EV\u2010G1, \u2010G2, and \u2010G17 genomes. The complete KNU\u20101811 genome shared 73.7% nucleotide identity with a prototype EV\u2010G1 strain, but had 83.9%\u201386.7% sequence homology with the global EV\u2010G1\u2010PLCP strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the Korean recombinant EV\u2010G\u0027s own VP1 and inserted foreign PLCP genes are most closely related independently to contemporary chimeric G1\u2010PLCP and G17\u2010PLCP strains respectively. These results implied that the torovirus\u2010derived PLCP gene might have undergone continuous nucleotide mutations in the respective EV\u2010G genome following its independent acquisition through naturally occurring recombination. Our results advance the understanding of the genetic evolution of EV\u2010G driven by infrequent viral recombination events, by which EV\u2010G populations laterally gain an exotic gene encoding a virulence factor from heterogeneous virus families, thereby causing clinical disease in swine.","publish_time":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sunhee; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37e534746159fe5f99c24cf7faeaf4e0a2b1d1ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30431236/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13073","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Enterovirus species G"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel EV","respective EV","global EV","prototype EV","G genome","G strain","Korean recombinant EV","genetic evolution of EV","PLCP strains","Enterovirus species G","derived PLCP gene","G1 strain","inserted foreign PLCP genes","nucleotide identity","diarrhoea","order recombination","contemporary chimeric G1","results","infrequent viral recombination events","continuous nucleotide mutations","exotic gene","cysteine protease","pig populations","G17 genomes","sequence homology","complete KNU","porcine torovirus papain","predicted protease similar","swine enteric coronaviruses","VP1","G\u0027s","diagnostic faecal samples","heterogeneous virus families","virulence factor","neonatal pigs","clinical disease","phylogenetic analyses","independent acquisition","genotypes","understanding","G2","cleavage sites","present study","rotavirus","insertion","diversity","amino acid","junction region"],"language":"en"},

Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","publish_time":"2006-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subbarao, Kanta; Roberts, Anjeanette","journal":"Trends in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e1b8fe4637240f2d6af6e6c360455241d322bf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119110.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X06001272; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X06001272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ideal animal model","study of SARS","current animal models","use of animal models","given model","studies of SARS pathogenesis","aspects","immunotherapy","vaccine development","time","specific interventions","antiviral drugs","vaccines","limitations","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","public health measures","assessment","reproducibility of findings","strengths","important principles","establishment","human disease","Consistency","superiority"],"language":"en"},

Increasingly, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) containing high and well-balanced concentrations of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are recommended for emergency oral anticoagulation reversal. Both the safety and efficacy of such products are currently in focus, and their administration is now expanding into the critical care setting for the treatment of life-threatening bleeding and coagulopathy resulting either perioperatively or in cases of acute trauma. METHODS: After 15 yr of clinical use, findings of a pharmacovigilance report (February 1996\u2013March 2012) relating to the four-factor PCC Beriplex P/N (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) were analysed and are presented here. Furthermore, a review of the literature with regard to the efficacy and safety of four-factor PCCs was performed. RESULTS: Since receiving marketing authorization (February 21, 1996), \u223C647 250 standard applications of Beriplex P/N have taken place. During this time, 21 thromboembolic events judged to be possibly related to Beriplex P/N administration have been reported, while no incidences of viral transmission or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia were documented. The low risk of thromboembolic events reported during the observation period (one in \u223C31 000) is in line with the incidence observed with other four-factor PCCs. CONCLUSIONS: In general, four-factor PCCs have proven to be well tolerated and highly effective in the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanke, A.A.; Joch, C.; G\u00F6rlinger, K.","journal":"Br J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d240c8f13a78feb065e0d4f032d398d380a4c4c9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b6f595df85b3bb20ed8af8e7de78b56c645285fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094476.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091217326740; https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aes501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23335567/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0007091217326740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCC Beriplex P/N (CSL Behring","Beriplex P/N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["factor PCCs","factor PCC Beriplex P","rapid reversal of vitamin","N administration","treatment of life-threatening bleeding","effects of vitamin","standard applications of Beriplex P","factor prothrombin complex concentrates","efficacy","safety","antagonists","emergency oral anticoagulation reversal","well-balanced concentrations of vitamin","cases of emergency surgery","high morbidity","low risk of thromboembolic events","cases of acute trauma","CSL Behring","dependent coagulation factors","findings","mortality","coagulopathy","yr of clinical use","incidences of viral transmission","heparin-induced thrombocytopenia","critical care setting","Marburg","regard","pharmacovigilance report","intracranial haemorrhage","Germany","literature","products","observation period","place","RESULTS","marketing authorization","review","METHODS","focus","time","BACKGROUND","line","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Silver in the nano form, which is being used increasingly as antibacterial agents, may extend its antibacterial application to emerging and re-emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens, the main cause of nosocomial diseases worldwide. In the present study, a completely bottom up method to prepare green nano-silver was used. To explore the action of nano-silver on emerging Bacillus megaterium MTCC 7192 and re-emerging Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741 pathogenic bacteria, the study includes an analysis of the bacterial membrane damage through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as well as alternation of zeta potential and intracellular leakages. In this work, we observed genuine bactericidal property of nano-silver as compare to broad spectrum antibiotics against emerging and re-emerging mode. After being exposed to nano-silver, the membrane becomes scattered from their original ordered arrangement based on SEM observation. Moreover, our results also suggested that alternation of zeta potential enhanced membrane permeability, and beyond a critical point, it leads to cell death. The leakages of intracellular constituents were confirmed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). In conclusion, the combine results suggested that at a specific dose, nano-silver may destroy the structure of bacterial membrane and depress its activity, which causes bacteria to die eventually.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anuj, Samir A.; Gajera, Harsukh P.; Hirpara, Darshna G.; Golakiya, Baljibhai A.","journal":"Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f76d6cb9e9d31374a2e34196acddd84f88aa04c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29735327/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0946672X18301275; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2018.04.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X18301275","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Scanning Electron Microscope"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["green nano-silver","action of nano","nano form","bacterial membrane damage","structure of bacterial membrane","genuine bactericidal property of nano","alternation of zeta potential enhanced membrane permeability","pathogenic bacteria","re-emerging mode","intracellular leakages","re-emerging Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC","emerging Bacillus megaterium MTCC","growing number of bacteria resistant","leakages of intracellular constituents","deadly infections","SEM observation","antibacterial application","combine results","antibacterial agents","present study","broad spectrum antibiotics","multidrug-resistant pathogens","emergence of new infections","Scanning Electron Microscope","original ordered arrangement","Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry","urgent need","GC","re-emergence","analysis","main cause of nosocomial diseases","specific dose","novel therapeutic agent","critical point","threat","method","MS","work","activity","cell death","Abstract","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Reunion Island during the austral winter 2009 (weeks 30\u201344) that allowed identification of 125 households with at least one member who developed symptoms of Influenza-like illness (ILI). Three consecutive nasal swabs were collected from each household member (443 individuals) on day 0, 3 and 8 post-ILI report and tested for pH1N1 and 15 NIRVs by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Two successive waves of viral infections were identified: a first wave (W33\u201337) when pH1N1 was dominant and co-circulated with NIRVs, sharply interrupted by a second wave (W38\u201344), almost exclusively composed of NIRVs, mainly human Rhinoviruses (hRV) and Coronaviruses (hCoV). Data suggest that some interference may occur between NIRVs and pH1N1 when they co-circulate within the same household, where NIRVs were more likely to infect pH1N1 negative individuals than pH1N1 positive peers (relative risk: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.80\u20135.46, P\u003C0.001). Viral shedding was significantly shorter (P = 0.035) in patients who were co-infected by pH1N1 and NIRV or by two different NIRVs compared to those who were infected with only one virus, whatever this virus was (pH1N1 or NIRVs). Although intense co-circulation of NIRVs (especially hRV) likely brought pH1N1 under the detection threshold, it did not prevent spread of the pandemic Influenza virus within the susceptible population nor induction of an extensive herd immunity to it. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that NIRV co-infections during Influenza epidemics may act as cofactors that contribute to shape an outbreak and modulate the attack rate. They further warrant broad spectrum studies to fully understand viral epidemics.","publish_time":"2012-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pascalis, Herv\u00E9; Temmam, Sarah; Turpin, Magali; Rollot, Olivier; Flahault, Antoine; Carrat, Fabrice; de Lamballerie, Xavier; G\u00E9rardin, Patrick; Dellagi, Koussay","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eb90019b82d03c01d91fd62ca9ba89d60814f82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3440351.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984554/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIRV"],"locations":["Reunion Island"],"keyphrases":["pH1N1 pandemic","different NIRVs","pH1N1 negative individuals","intense co-circulation of NIRVs","pH1N1 positive peers","pandemic Influenza virus","Influenza epidemics","NIRV co-infections","symptoms of Influenza","viral epidemics","co-circulating human Non-Influenza Respiratory Viruses","hRV","Viral shedding","RESULTS","household member","successive waves of viral infections","susceptible population","human Rhinoviruses","present study","prospective cohort study","post-ILI report","induction","Reunion Island","relative risk","respective roles","day","austral winter","extensive herd immunity","Coronaviruses","spread","patients","broad spectrum studies","outbreak","community level","aim","consecutive nasal swabs","illness","cofactors","interference","detection threshold","RT-PCR","attack rate","OBJECTIVE","weeks","households","hCoV","METHODS","CONCLUSION","W33","identification","Data","W38"],"language":"en"},

Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host.","publish_time":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pope, Welkin H.; Jacobs-Sera, Deborah; Russell, Daniel A.; Rubin, Daniel H.

We previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein as a major target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models and thus proposed a RBD-based vaccine. However, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD in humans need to be characterized. RESULTS: Two panels of serum samples from recovered SARS patients were included and the antibody responses against the RBD were measured by ELISA and micro-neutralization assays. We found that the RBD of S protein induced potent antibody responses in the recovered SARS patients and RBD-specific antibodies could persist at high titers over three year follow-up. Furthermore, affinity purified anti-RBD antibodies possessed robust neutralizing activity. CONCLUSION: The RBD of SARS-CoV is highly immunogenic in humans and mediates protective responses and RBD-based vaccines and diagnostic approaches can be further developed.","publish_time":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Zhiliang; Liu, Lifeng; Du, Lanying; Zhang, Chao; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Taisheng; He, Yuxian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1ec83bddfe11fc5f176972ca4ae358b4f46c79f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2988023.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21047436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD of SARS","RBD of S protein","immunogenicity of RBD","RBD-specific antibodies","anti-RBD antibodies","RBD-based vaccines","protein of SARS","recovered SARS patients","major target of neutralizing antibodies","potent antibody responses","protective responses","humans","robust neutralizing activity","receptor-binding domain","panels of serum samples","animal models","high titers","ELISA","diagnostic approaches","affinity","spike","micro-neutralization assays","year follow-up","RESULTS","antigenicity","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In order to investigate the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, we used a BTV8 strain minimally passaged in tissue culture (termed BTV8(L) in this study) and a derivative strain passaged extensively in tissue culture (BTV8(H)) in in vitro and in vivo studies. BTV8(L) was pathogenic in both IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice and in sheep, while BTV8(H) was attenuated in both species. To identify genetic changes which led to BTV8(H) attenuation, we generated 34 reassortants between BTV8(L) and BTV8(H). We found that partial attenuation of BTV8(L) in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice was achieved by simply replacing genomic segment 2 (Seg2, encoding VP2) or Seg10 (encoding NS3) with the BTV8(H) homologous segments. Fully attenuated viruses required at least two genome segments from BTV8(H), including Seg2 with either Seg1 (encoding VP1), Seg6 (encoding VP6 and NS4), or Seg10 (encoding NS3). Conversely, full reversion of virulence of BTV8(H) required at least five genomic segments of BTV8(L). We also demonstrated that BTV8(H) acquired an increased affinity for glycosaminoglycan receptors during passaging in cell culture due to mutations in its VP2 protein. Replication of BTV8(H) was relatively poor in interferon (IFN)-competent primary ovine endothelial cells compared to replication of BTV8(L), and this phenotype was determined by several viral genomic segments, including Seg4 and Seg9. This study demonstrated that multiple viral proteins contribute to BTV8 virulence. VP2 and NS3 are primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis, but VP1, VP5, VP4, VP6, and VP7 also contribute to virulence. IMPORTANCE Bluetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants, and it is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The clinical outcome of BTV infection varies considerably and depends on environmental and host- and virus-specific factors. Over the years, BTV serotypes/strains with various degrees of virulence (including nonpathogenic strains) have been described in different geographical locations. However, no data are available to correlate the BTV genotype to virulence. This study shows that BTV virulence is determined by different viral genomic segments. The data obtained will help to characterize thoroughly the pathogenesis of bluetongue. The possibility to determine the pathogenicity of virus isolates on the basis of their genome sequences will help in the design of control strategies that fit the risk posed by new emerging BTV strains.","publish_time":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janowicz, Anna; Caporale, Marco; Shaw, Andrew; Gulletta, Salvatore; Di Gialleonardo, Luigina; Ratinier, Maxime; Palmarini, Massimo","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abf5d95b34f46f9799a78d66462de49055ded846.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4442542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822026/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00395-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Organization for Animal Health","BTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BTV8 virulence","BTV8 strain","Replication of BTV8","termed BTV8","genomic segments of BTV8","partial attenuation of BTV8","BTV serotypes","BTV genotype","molecular determinants of BTV virulence","reversion of virulence","primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis","different viral genomic segments","genome segments","Bluetongue virus","new emerging BTV strains","various degrees of virulence","homologous segments","pathogenesis of bluetongue","NS3","study","clinical outcome of BTV infection","tissue culture","IMPORTANCE Bluetongue","cell culture","VP1","nonpathogenic strains","VP6","Seg2","VP2 protein","Seg10","mice","IFNAR","data","major hemorrhagic disease of ruminants","multiple viral proteins","pathogenicity of virus isolates","virus-specific factors","genome sequences","derivative strain","major infectious diseases of ruminants","notifiable disease","attenuated viruses","different geographical locations","competent primary ovine endothelial cells","passaging","World Organization","glycosaminoglycan receptors","risk","increased affinity","basis","mutations","interferon","VP5","Animal Health","OIE","host","Seg6","VP4","Seg4","design of control strategies","NS4","VP7","Seg9","years","sheep","genetic changes","order","possibility","phenotype","reassortants","species","studies"],"language":"en"},

However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for development of new host-targeted antivirals.","publish_time":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaucherand, Lea; Porter, Brittany K.; Schmaling, Summer K.; Rycroft, Christopher Harley; Kevorkian, Yuzo; McCormick, Craig; Khaperskyy, Denys A.; Gaglia, Marta Maria","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09ec8daa8e32168d92d05b86de1784c639685fb4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f6df5f8a5b5d6f591c41d4af9673b5309989dba6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/442996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","viral host shutoff nucleases","host RNAs","viral proteins","specificity of viral control of host gene expression","virus shutoff factor PA-X","viral replication","RNA splicing","development of new host-targeted antivirals","cellular proteins","target discrimination","molecular determinants of target selectivity","activation of cell","opportunities","transcriptome-wide","spliced mRNAs","novel mechanism sheds light","intrinsic antiviral responses","influenza","proximity-labeling proteomics","reporter assays","interaction","viruses","destruction"],"language":"en"},

Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003E 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u2264 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1\u20132 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25\u201329) vs. 23 (22\u201325), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO(2)/FiO(2) significantly improved after 1\u20132 h of NIV [median 172 (150\u2013208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79\u2013130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%).

A Systematic Literature Review","doi":"10.1089/vbz.2017.2191","pmcid":"PMC6396572","pubmed_id":"30676269","license":"cc-by-nc","abstract":"Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials. Conclusions: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. Terms such as \u201Ccamel exposure\u201D and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, arguing for a unified \u201COne Health\u201D approach.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dawson, Patrick; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Parvez, Faruque; Morse, Stephen S.","journal":"Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70fd2c4e38970a59c42925daef90f674d7b21302.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6396572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30676269/; https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2017.2191","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dromedary"],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":["Middle East","Africa","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["human MERS-CoV transmission","substantial MERS-CoV research","natural hosts of MERS","human outbreaks","human receptor","human clinical trials","zoonotic source of human infection","Transmission mechanisms","health care","epidemiology","current knowledge","critical knowledge gaps","significant knowledge gaps","primary cases","camel exposure","camel contact","systematic review","evidence of camel","Dromedary camels","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","epidemiological relationships of cases","systematic literature review","clinical characteristics","natural history","virology","outcomes","Saudi Arabia","preventive options","animal interface","key areas","Background","South Korea","rigorous studies of baseline prevalence","variety of molecular","Dipeptidyl peptidase","DPP4","CD26","CoVs","PRISMA guidelines","peer-reviewed publications","accessible registry","database","Results","serological assays","contributions","Phase","spectrum of disease","Methods","Africa","candidate vaccine","environmental contamination","Various potential therapeutics","bat species","approach","Terms","Conclusions","traveler","Materials","humans","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah involve mass gatherings of international travellers. We set out to assess the presence of influenza and MERS-CoV in Hajj/Umrah returnees with acute respiratory infection. METHODS: Disembarking passengers (n = 8753) from Saudi Arabia (October 2014 to April 2015) were interviewed for the presence of respiratory symptoms; 977 (11%) reported symptoms and 300 (age 26 \u201390, median 60 years; 140 male) consented to participate in the study. After recording clinical and demographic data, twin swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were collected from each participant, pooled in viral transport media and tested by real-time RT PCR for MERS-CoV and influenza A and B viruses and their subtypes. RESULTS: The participants had symptoms of 1\u201315 days (median 5d); cough (90%) and nasal discharge (86%) being the commonest. None of the 300 participants tested positive for MERS-CoV; however, 33 (11%) tested positive for influenza viruses (A/H3N2 = 13, A/H1N1pdm09 = 9 and B/Yamagata = 11).

An epidemiological investigation of the causative agent, which was of a highly infective nature, was conducted. METHODS: Throat swabs were carried out and a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to identify possible causative factors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients who had febrile illness during the study period was 20.24 years. The multiplex RT-PCR assay identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the causative agent. The main symptoms were sore throat (76.0%), sputum (72.8%), cough (72.1%), tonsillar hypertrophy (67.9%), and rhinorrhea (55.9%). The mean temperature was 38.75\u00B0C and the attack rate among the recruits was 15.7% (588 out of 3750 recruits), while the mean duration of fever was 2.3 days. The prognosis was generally favorable with supportive care but recurrent fever occurred in 10.1% of the patients within a month. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first epidemiological study of an RSV outbreak that developed in a healthy young adult group. In the event of an outbreak of an acute febrile illness of a highly infective nature in facilities used by a young adult group, RSV should be considered among the possible causative agents.","publish_time":"2015-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Won-Ju; Yoo, Seok-Ju; Lee, Suk-Ho; Chung, Jae-Woo; Jang, Keun-Ho; Moon, Jai-Dong","journal":"J Prev Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6203b7c7808aac525f83c3cc7d0107cf90344259.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4322513.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.14.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Korea Air Force"],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["RSV outbreak","outbreak of acute febrile illness","possible causative factors","possible causative agents","multiplex RT-PCR assay","mean duration of fever","mean age of patients","epidemiological study","mean temperature","infective nature","recruits","healthy young adult group","recurrent fever","study period","epidemiological investigation","sore throat","Throat swabs","multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","respiratory syncytial virus","Republic of Korea Air Force boot camp","supportive care","facilities","prognosis","main symptoms","attack rate","days","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","cough","sputum","METHODS","years","event","tonsillar hypertrophy","month","CONCLUSIONS","rhinorrhea"],"language":"en"},

Newly available advanced nanomanufacturing techniques now allow very precise control of adjuvant particle size, shape, texture, and surface chemistry. Novel adjuvant concepts include self-assembling particles and targeted immune delivery. These individual concepts can be combined to create a single integrated vaccine nanoparticle-combining antigen, adjuvants, and DC-targeting elements. In the process, the concept of an adjuvant has broadened to include not only immune-stimulatory substances but also any design features that enhance the immune response against the relevant vaccine antigen. The modern definition of an adjuvant includes not only classical immune stimulators but also any aspects of particle size, shape, and surface chemistry that enhance vaccine immunogenicity. It even includes purely physical processes such as texturing of particle surfaces to maximize immunogenicity. Looking forward, adjuvants will increasingly be seen not as separate add-on items but as wholly integrated elements of a complete vaccine delivery package. Hence, vaccine systems will increasingly approach the complexity and sophistication of pathogens themselves, incorporating highly specific particle properties, contents, and behaviors, all designed to maximize immune system recognition and drive the immune response in the specific direction that affords maximal protection.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barclay, T.; Petrovsky, N.","journal":"Micro and Nanotechnology in Vaccine Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71491672e3ebbdb760264a8a3318e5207a7456e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151801.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323399814000075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323399814000075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune response","vaccine immunogenicity","vaccine systems","increasing sophistication of vaccine adjuvant design","targeted immune delivery","relevant vaccine antigen","classical immune stimulators","Novel adjuvant concepts","immune-stimulatory substances","immune system recognition","precise control of adjuvant particle size","particle surfaces","single integrated vaccine nanoparticle","complete vaccine delivery package","aspects of particle size","specific particle properties","shape","design features","integrated elements","surface chemistry","importance of nanoscale features of adjuvants","specific direction","sophistication of pathogens","individual concepts","self-assembling particles","texture","improved understanding","available advanced nanomanufacturing techniques","contents","complexity","behaviors","separate add-on items","immunological function","maximal protection","DC","physical processes","modern definition"],"language":"en"},

By means of whole\u2010genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wassenaar, T.M.; Zou, Y.","journal":"Lett Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23d083670f409a442e250e13709048ba569fd31a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165814.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32060933/; https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Chinese bat species","novel virus species","novel coronavirus","exact bat species","rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species","coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species","likely natural host","number of coronavirus genomes","downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes","noncoding flanks","betacoronavirus subspecies","zoonotic coronavirus epidemics","Traditional Chinese Medicine","upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus","commercial value","nCoV","potential risk","target sequences","natural reservoirs of coronaviruses","bats","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome","genetic similarities","viral genome","trading purposes","genome sequence comparisons","correct identification of genetic relationships","STUDY","handling","theory","China","current outbreak","change","zoonoses","practices","IMPACT","subgenus","difficulties","SIGNIFICANCE","SARS","conservation"],"language":"en"},

Summary Objectives To describe epidemiological features of viral nosocomial infections (VNI) and their prevention principles. Epidemiology Many factors lead to underestimate VNI: difficulty to distinguish between community-acquired and nosocomial infections for seasonal viral diseases, incubation time leading to symptoms after patient discharge, difficulty for diagnosis. Population at high risks of VNI are the children, the elderly and the immunocompromized patients. The risk of severe diseases is high in this last population. The main reservoir of virus is infected symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic carriers, especially health care workers, are a major source of transmission. Main routes of transmission are the fecal\u2013oral route, the respiratory route, cutaneous or mucous contact and blood and body fluids exposure. A review of the main virus involved in VNI is presented. Prevention Preventive measures, such as strict adherence to standard precautions and, in some instances, to isolation procedures, are critical to control VNI. In a major outbreak situation, it may be necessary to consider cohort isolation. Specific control measures rely on immunization, antiviral drug prophylaxis (varicella\u2013zooster, herpes, influenza, exposure to blood) and clinical and biological screening of organ, blood, tissue and cell donors.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Traor\u00E9, O.; Aumeran, C.; Henquell, C.","journal":"Antibiotiques","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9876f807f62e33640fbc9d4e184374788c7abfe0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146799.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1294550108001088; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1294550108001088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure to blood","the fecal","the children","the elderly","The risk","critical to control VNI","to isolation procedures","The main reservoir","the respiratory route","the immunocompromized patients","the main virus involved in VNI is presented","difficulty to distinguish between community","Epidemiology Many factors lead to underestimate VNI","viral nosocomial infections","principales voies de transmission","virus responsables","Summary Objectives To describe epidemiological features","infections nosocomiales virales","such as strict adherence to standard precautions","incubation time leading to symptoms after patient discharge","virus is infected symptomatic","severe diseases is high in this","it may be necessary to consider cohort isolation","in some instances","intrication des infections communautaires","Main routes","exposition","pr\u00E9cautions standard","donneurs de sang","pr\u00E9vention sp\u00E9cifique","revue des principaux virus impliqu\u00E9s","seasonal viral diseases","Prevention Preventive measures","regroupement des patients infect\u00E9s","oral route","sortie du patient","Specific control measures rely","Population at high risks","Asymptomatic carriers","major source","asymptomatic individuals","voies digestive","risque \u00E9lev\u00E9","sujets infect\u00E9s","major outbreak situation","body fluids exposure","their prevention principles","risque de formes cliniques graves","acquired","immunization","mucous contact","antiviral drug prophylaxis","varicella","zooster","herpes","cutaneous","caract\u00E9ristiques \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques","fonction des modes","especially health care workers","herp\u00E8s","application rigoureuse","grippe","biological screening","clinical","influenza","viroses saisonni\u00E8res","varicelle-zona","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de grande ampleur","hygi\u00E8ne","accident","s\u00E9lection clinique","review","chimioprophylaxie","personnel de soins","situations","dur\u00E9e","vaccination","organes","manifestation","enfants","diagnosis","mesures pr\u00E9ventives","r\u00E9servoir principal","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objectifs","personnes \u00E2g\u00E9es","cell donors","cas","premier plan","isolement septique","derniers","difficult\u00E9s diagnostiques","tissus","risques","\u00E9valuation","produits biologiques","principes","nombreux facteurs","porteurs asymptomatiques","\u00C9pid\u00E9miologie"],"language":"fr"},

In our study, we used hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 virus to investigate the related signaling pathways and their relationship to dysregulated innate immune reaction. We found the HA of H5N1 avian influenza triggered an abnormal innate immune signalling in the pulmonary epithelial cells, through an unusual process involving activation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) that is exclusively associated with \u03B3c chain and is essential for signaling via all \u03B3c cytokine receptors. By using a selective JAK3 inhibitor and JAK3 knockout mice, we have, for the first time, demonstrated the ability to target active JAK3 to counteract injury to the lungs and protect immunocytes from acute hypercytokinemia -induced destruction following the challenge of H5N1 HA in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of the present data, it appears that the efficacy of selective JAK3 inhibition is likely based on its ability to block multiple cytokines and protect against a superinflammatory response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) attack. Our findings highlight the potential value of selective JAK3 inhibitor in treating the fatal immunopathology caused by H5N1 challenge.","publish_time":"2012-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Wei; Chen, Minhui; Ge, Nanhai; Xu, Jun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1868242435edf92a6b0018f2569c2012f672ddf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3280993.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0031721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22359619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Janus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active JAK3","H5N1 virus","H5N1 challenge","challenge of H5N1 HA","HA of H5N1 avian influenza","efficacy of selective JAK3 inhibition","JAK3 knockout mice","potential value of selective JAK3 inhibitor","fatal immunopathology","ability","innate immune reaction","virus-mediated immunopathology","abnormal innate immune signalling","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","fatal outbreaks","\u03B3c chain","\u03B3c cytokine receptors","HPAIVs","pulmonary epithelial cells","unusual process","immunocytes","cause severe disease","acute hypercytokinemia -induced destruction","molecular patterns","antiviral therapies","superinflammatory response","relationship","lungs","activation of Janus kinase","PAMPs","effective vaccines","humans","lack of understanding","pathways","injury","hemagglutinin","multiple cytokines","attack","findings","present data","basis","study","time"],"language":"en"},

We provide examples of the utility of molecular assays in research and clinical care of emerging infectious diseases. We also discuss some theoretical and practical limitations of molecular tests and the future prospects of expanding molecular diagnostics for emerging pathogens based on new advances of knowledge and technologies.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, J.; Ismail, N.; Walker, D.

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China\u2019s most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province\u2019s large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Jing; du Plessis, Louis; Liu, Zhe; Hill, Verity; Kang, Min; Lin, Huifang; Sun, Jiufeng; Fran\u00E7ois, Sarah; Kraemer, Moritz U.G.; Faria, Nuno R.; McCrone, John T.; Peng, Jinju; Xiong, Qianling; Yuan, Runyu; Zeng, Lilian; Zhou, Pingping; Liang, Chumin; Yi, Lina; Liu, Jun; Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; Liu, Tao; Ma, Wenjun; Li, Wei; Su, Juan; Zheng, Huanying; Peng, Bo; Fang, Shisong; Su, Wenzhe; Li, Kuibiao; Sun, Ruilin; Bai, Ru; Tang, Xi; Liang, Minfeng; Quick, Josh; Song, Tie; Rambaut, Andrew; Loman, Nick; Raghwani, Jayna; Pybus, Oliver G.; Ke, Changwen","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d14280a2ef056267a21e36a4a52c4f1df88fe958.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192124.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420304864; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420304864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["Guangdong","Extensive molecular surveillance","SARS-CoV","COVID","genetic diversity of SARS","phylogenetic clustering","phylogenetic analyses","province\u2019s large-scale intensive surveillance","molecular epidemiology","number of cases","reported RNA-positive cases","central China","low virus genetic variation","multiple independent introductions","combination of metagenomic sequencing","duration of putative local transmission chains","national travel restrictions","China\u2019s","size","intervention measures","tiling amplicon approaches","infected individuals","genomes","populous province","timing","Summary Coronavirus disease","pandemic","infection","results","countries","tests","order","successes"],"language":"en"},

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, human activities are largely restricted in many regions in India since mid-March of 2020, and it is a progressing experiment to testify effectiveness of restricted emissions. In this study, concentrations of six criteria pollutants, PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, ozone and SO2 during March 16th to April 14th from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities covering different regions of India were analysed. Overall, around 43, 31, 10, and 18% decreases in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 in India were observed during lockdown period compared to previous years. While, there were 17% increase in O3 and negligible changes in SO2. The air quality index (AQI) reduced by 44, 33, 29, 15 and 32% in north, south, east, central and western India, respectively. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. The mean excessive risks of PM reduced by ~52% nationwide due to restricted activities in lockdown period. To eliminate the effects of possible favourable meteorology, the WRF-AERMOD model system was also applied in Delhi-NCR with actual meteorology during the lockdown period and an un-favourable event in early November of 2019 and results show that predicted PM2.5 could increase by only 33% in unfavourable meteorology. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that even during unfavourable meteorology, a significant improvement in air quality could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.","publish_time":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Shubham; Zhang, Mengyuan; Anshika,; Gao, Jingsi; Zhang, Hongliang; Kota, Sri Harsha","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfa36fcaf8ffbcff133249759be27f85cdfd10c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335409/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138878; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323950; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["lockdown period","unfavourable meteorology","previous years","different regions of India","actual meteorology","western India","restricted activities","air quality index","control measures","effects of possible favourable meteorology","PM10","cities","eastern regions","study","NO2","effectiveness of restricted emissions","SO2","predicted PM2","increase","strict execution of air quality control plans","significant improvement","human activities","significant regional transport","un-favourable event","WRF-AERMOD model system","criteria pollutants","regulatory bodies","policy-makers","Delhi-NCR","factors","O3","negligible changes","concentrations","progressing experiment","mean excessive risks of PM","COVID","pandemic","cost","confidence","results","pre-test","AQI","north","implementation","Correlation","ozone","decreases"],"language":"en"},

Alignments of primary amino acid sequences indicate that baculovirus fusion proteins of group I nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) form the GP64 superfamily. The structure of these viral penetrenes has not been determined. The GP64 superfamily includes the glycoprotein (GP) encoded by members of the Thogotovirus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae. The entry proteins of other baculoviruses, group II NPV and granuloviruses, are class I penetrenes. RESULTS: Class III penetrenes encoded by members of the Rhabdoviridae and Herpesviridae have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta sheets, other beta sheet domains, an extended alpha helical domain, a membrane proximal stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. Similar sequences and structural/functional motifs that characterize class III penetrenes are located collinearly in GP64 of group I baculoviruses and related glycoproteins encoded by thogotoviruses. Structural models based on a prototypic class III penetrene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G), were established for Thogoto virus (THOV) GP and Autographa california multiple NPV (AcMNPV) GP64 demonstrating feasible cysteine linkages. Glycosylation sites in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 appear in similar model locations to the two glycosylation sites of VSV G.

METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database collected during 1997\u20132005. Patients with incident severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) and gallstone-related procedures (elective and non-elective cholecystectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) that led to hospital admission were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes. Annual incidence rates of gallstone-related complications and procedures were calculated and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The hospital admission rate for severe gallstone disease increased with advancing age and the age-standardized rate (95% CI) per 1000 population was 0.60 (0.59\u20130.60) for men and 0.59 (0.59\u20130.60) for women. Men had a higher rate of acute cholecystitis, probably due to the substantially lower rate of elective cholecystectomy among men than women. For those aged 20\u201339, hospital admissions for all gallstone-related complications and procedures increased significantly. For those aged \u226560, incidences of biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and hospital admission for gallstone receiving ERCP increased significantly without substantial change in the incidence of acute cholecystitis and despite a decreased rate of elective cholecystectomy. CONCLUSION: This population-based study found a substantial increase in the rate of admission for severe gallstone disease among those aged 20\u201339.

Here, we show that viral enhancement by ectopically expressed LY6E extends to several cellular backgrounds and affects multiple RNA viruses. LY6E does not impair IFN antiviral activity or signaling, but rather promotes viral entry. Using influenza A virus as a model, we narrow the enhancing effect of LY6E to uncoating after endosomal escape. Diverse mammalian orthologs of LY6E also enhance viral infectivity, indicating evolutionary conservation of function. By structure-function analyses, we identify a single amino acid in a predicted loop region that is essential for viral enhancement.

A clear description of local RSV molecular epidemiology, evolution, and transmission requires detailed sequence data and can inform new strategies for virus control and vaccine development. We have generated 27 complete or nearly complete genomes of RSV from hospitalized children attending a rural coastal district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, over a 10-year period using a novel full-genome deep-sequencing process. Phylogenetic analysis of the new genomes demonstrated the existence and cocirculation of multiple genotypes in both RSV A and B groups in Kilifi. Comparison of local versus global strains demonstrated that most RSV A variants observed locally in Kilifi were also seen in other parts of the world, while the Kilifi RSV B genomes encoded a high degree of variation that was not observed in other parts of the world. The nucleotide substitution rates for the individual open reading frames (ORFs) were highest in the regions encoding the attachment (G) glycoprotein and the NS2 protein. The analysis of RSV full genomes, compared to subgenomic regions, provided more precise estimates of the RSV sequence changes and revealed important patterns of RSV genomic variation and global movement. The novel sequencing method and the new RSV genomic sequences reported here expand our knowledge base for large-scale RSV epidemiological and transmission studies. IMPORTANCE The new RSV genomic sequences and the novel sequencing method reported here provide important data for understanding RSV transmission and vaccine development. Given the complex interplay between RSV A and RSV B infections, the existence of local RSV B evolution is an important factor in vaccine deployment.","publish_time":"2015-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agoti, Charles N.; Otieno, James R.; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Mwihuri, Alexander G.; Cane, Patricia A.; Nokes, D.

Methods A total of 445 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients with AFRS were analyzed using the RespiFinderSmart22kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system. Results Among the 225 (225/445, 51%) positive specimens, 329 positive pathogens were detected, including 298 (90.58%) viruses and 31 (9%) bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza virus (IFV; 37.39%; 123/329), adenovirus (AdV; 17.02%; 56/329), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; 10.94%; 36/329), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 10.03%; 33/329), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs; 8.51%; 28/329), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneu; 8.51%; 28/329), respectively. Among the co-infected cases (17.53%; 78/445), IFV/AdV and IFV/M. pneu were the most common co-infections. Most of the respiratory viruses were detected in summer and fall. Conclusion In our study, IFV-A was the most common respiratory pathogen among 22 detected pathogens, followed by AdV, HCoV, RV/EV, PIV, and M. pneu. Bacteria appeared less frequently than viruses, and co-infection was the most common phenomenon among viral pathogens. Pathogens were distributed among different age groups and respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November. Enhanced surveillance and early detection can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AFRS, as well as for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"LIU, Gao Shan; LI, Hong; ZHAO, Sheng Cang; LU, Rou Jian; NIU, Pei Hua; TAN, Wen Jie","journal":"Biomedical and Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b781838727e0dc14e35f361d1093f4016627b656.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2019.058; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398819301230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262389/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398819301230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFRS","IFV/AdV","IFV/M"],"locations":["Qinghai","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","detected pathogens","IFV","viral pathogens","positive pathogens","AdV","parainfluenza viruses","common respiratory pathogen","common co-infections","common phenomenon","prevention of AFRS","positive specimens","study","acute febrile respiratory syndrome","co-infected cases","epidemiology of patients","nasopharyngeal swabs specimens","nucleic acid amplification test","commercial routine multiplex-ligation","NAT","Qinghai","different age groups","LightCycler","Netherlands","early detection","bacterial etiology","development of appropriate public health strategies","diagnosis","total","RespiFinderSmart22kit","treatment","Enhanced surveillance","PathoFinder BV","based assay","real-time PCR system","Methods","rhinovirus","enterovirus","summer","human coronaviruses","HCoVs","Abstract Objective","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","PIVs","fall","Conclusion","adenovirus","Results"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was \u226596% for all assays and the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kasteren, Puck B.; van der Veer, Bas; van den Brink, Sharon; Wijsman, Lisa; de Jonge, J\u00F8rgen; van den Brandt, Annemarie; Molenkamp, Richard; Reusken, Chantal B.E.M.; Meijer, Adam","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8ad5180fc8bf15ea168c8d7d03b5707afe5efb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206434.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301542?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416600/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104412","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Altona Diagnostics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR efficiency","clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits","positive clinical samples","clinical samples positive","SARS-CoV","commercial kits","panel of SARS","real-time reverse transcriptase PCR","non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections","novel coronavirus","panel of RNA","preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity","study","assays","spread","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Altona Diagnostics","serial dilutions of viral RNA","human population","detection rate","limit of detection","estimated LOD95","specific method available","related human coronaviruses","routine diagnostics of COVID","BGI","PrimerDesign","CerTest Biotec","KH Medical","different manufacturers","patients","infected individuals","accurate identification of virus","R-Biopharm AG","variations","experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories","assay specificity","emergence","cross-reactivity","major burden","Seegene","E-gene","globe","society","final months","fold range","Measures","aim"],"language":"en"},

Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zumla, Alimuddin; Dar, Osman; Kock, Richard; Muturi, Matthew; Ntoumi, Francine; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Eusebio, Macete; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Bates, Matthew; Mwaba, Peter; Ansumana, Rashid; Khan, Mishal; Alagaili, Abdulaziz N.; Cotten, Matthew; Azhar, Esam I.; Maeurer, Markus; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Petersen, Eskild","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db5830d2f5ad903e0cdfc3a3843f95852e613ed5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128966.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321961/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","Ebola Virus Disease"],"locations":["Middle East","Middle Eastern","West Africa","South America"],"keyphrases":["Hanta virus","Nipah virus","Dengue fever virus","Lassa Fever virus","Yellow fever virus","health of animals","West Nile virus","Health platform","Health concept","Rift Valley fever virus","Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus","ongoing Zika Virus outbreak","public health officers","recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic","global health security","international public health systems","zoonotic pathogens","wellbeing of humans","Environment","epidemic potential","appearance of novel pathogens of humans","decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans","zoonotic spread","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","West Africa","African stakeholders","animal reservoirs","animal husbandry specialists","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","ecologists","veterinarians","physicians","South America","high mortality rates","agriculturalists","range of expertise","vector biologists","urgent need","leadership","viral phylogeneticists","past","relationship","multidisciplinary team","effective partnerships","unique opportunities","creation","interconnectedness","researchers","Summary","establishment","centuries","approach","major outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC(50) of 4.9 \u03BCM but was cytotoxic at concentrations only two-fold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238\u2013265 \u03BCM) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC(50) of 6.3 \u03BCM, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216 \u03BCM. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to one h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24 h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC(50) of 4.5 and 9.3 \u03BCM. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor. This compound may provide valuable insights into molecular events that occur at the earliest times post-infection and serve as a lead structure for antiviral development.","publish_time":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Zohaib; Al-Mahdi, Zainab; Zhu, Yali; McKee, Zachary; Parris, Deborah S.; Parikh, Hardik I.; Kellogg, Glen E.; Kuchta, Alison; McVoy, Michael A.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef38ba20989158a6e6d16eb37cca9cc413137a10.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f3bf9e894993ec2cc895609dbdf1b5fd8a2541af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4289655.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214003349; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214003349; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25499125/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4289655?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV infectivity","CMV replication","CMV infectious yield","infectious yield of CMV","\u03BCM","Available CMV antivirals","novel CMV inhibitor","atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein","alizarin violet R inhibited CMV","atanyl blue PRL targets","CMV immediate early protein expression","viral nuclease","Related anthraquinones acid blue","inhibited spread","viral DNA polymerase","anthraquinone emodin","cytotoxic concentration","early post-entry events","blocked viral DNA synthesis","earliest times post-infection","significant disease","molecular events","significant toxicities","high concentrations","inhibition of UL98","antiviral development","antiviral activity","immunocompromised patients","serious birth defects","herpes simplex virus","lead structure","present study","different pathways","valuable insights","results","New drugs","Human cytomegalovirus","compound","utero","resistance"],"language":"en"},

Many studies have established that MITA/STING is a central component in the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA and RNA derived from pathogens. MITA can act both as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and as an adaptor for the recruitment of downstream signaling components. In both roles, MITA is part of signaling cascades that orchestrate innate immune defenses against various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites.

Early and rapid detection of DENV infection during the acute phase of illness is crucial for proper clinical patient management and preventing the spread of infection. The aim of the current study was to develop a specific, sensitive, and robust reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection and differentiation of DENV1-4 serotypes. RESULTS: The method detection primers, which were designed to target the different DENV serotypes, were identified by inspection of multiple sequence alignments of the non-structural protein (NS) 2A of DENV1, NS4B of DENV2, NS4A of DENV3 and the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the NS protein of DENV4. No cross-reactions of the four serotypes were observed during the tests. The detection limits of the DENV1-4-specific RT-LAMP assays were approximately 10-copy templates per reaction. The RT-LAMP assays were ten-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR or real-time PCR. The diagnostic rate was 100 % for clinical strains of DENV, and 98.9 % of the DENV-infected patients whose samples were tested were detected by RT-LAMP. Importantly, no false-positives were detected with the new equipment and methodology that was used to avoid aerosol contamination of the samples. CONCLUSION: The RT-LAMP method used in our study is specific, sensitive, and suitable for further investigation as a useful alternative to the current methods used for clinical diagnosis of DENV1-4, especially in hospitals and laboratories that lack sophisticated diagnostic systems.","publish_time":"2015-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Sheng-feng; Li, Miao; Zhong, Lan-lan; Lu, Shi-miao; Liu, Ze-xia; Pu, Jie-ying; Wen, Jin-sheng; Huang, Xi","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e803f9a98199d4c1e322f933e9943db653460be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4647581.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-015-0595-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26572227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP method","RT-PCR","specific RT-LAMP assays","clinical strains of DENV","rapid detection of DENV infection","different DENV serotypes","clinical diagnosis of DENV1","differentiation of DENV1","detection limits","method detection primers","DENV-infected patients","current study","samples","NS protein of DENV4","proper clinical patient management","non-structural protein","current methods","spread of infection","real-time PCR","diagnostic rate","sophisticated diagnostic systems","isothermal amplification","robust reverse transcriptase loop","acute phase of illness","inspection of multiple sequence alignments","fold","NS4A of DENV3","useful alternative","untranslated region","threat","human health","laboratories","investigation","NS4B of DENV2","hospitals","new equipment","methodology","subtropics","BACKGROUND","Dengue virus","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","aerosol contamination","false-positives","templates","prevalent arbovirus","cross-reactions","aim","tests"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, these cells are grown in medium supplemented with serum and other animal-or human-derived components to support viability and productivity. Such proteins are also typically added as excipients and stabilizers in the final drug formulation. However, the transmission of hepatitis B in the 1970s and of hepatitis C and HIV in the 1980s through plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates had catastrophic consequences for hemophilia patients. Thus, due to regulatory concerns about the inherent potential for transmission of infectious agents as well as the heterogeneity and lack of reliability of the serum supply, a trend has emerged to eliminate the use of plasma-derived additives in the production and formulation of recombinant protein therapeutics. This practice began with products used in the treatment of hemophilia and is progressively expanding throughout the entire industry. The plasma-free method of producing recombinant therapeutics is accomplished by the use of both cell culture media and final product formulations that do not contain animal-or human-derived additives. A number of recombinant therapeutic proteins for the treatment of several different diseases have been produced by plasma-free processes, with the objective of improving safety by eliminating blood-borne pathogens or by reducing immunogenicity. This review describes the factors that drove the development of plasma-free protein therapeutics and provides examples of advances in manufacturing that have made possible the removal of human and animal-derived products from all steps of recombinant protein production.","publish_time":"2009-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grillberger, Leopold; Kreil, Thomas R; Nasr, Sonia; Reiter, Manfred","journal":"Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bad87b7effc9c6f6a9ef4ca024f7fe86daff4f45.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2837a0ec1feef2c99b220fa8bd4f35872f8c95a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2699044.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19226552/; https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.200800241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma-derived factor","recombinant therapeutics","use of plasma","animal-derived products","human-derived additives","human-derived components","formulation of recombinant protein therapeutics","free protein therapeutics","development of plasma","plasma-free method","plasma-free processes","steps of recombinant protein production","number of recombinant therapeutic proteins","removal of human","treatment of hemophilia","final drug formulation","transmission of hepatitis B","serum supply","hemophilia patients","hepatitis C","Mammalian cells","final product formulations","transmission of infectious agents","concentrates","inherent potential","cell culture media","catastrophic consequences","expression system of choice","examples of advances","HIV","heterogeneity","manufacturing","lack of reliability","objective","stabilizers","excipients","viability","complex post-translational modifications","regulatory concerns","different diseases","pathogens","safety","blood","trend","factors","productivity","entire industry","immunogenicity","review","practice"],"language":"en"},

RNA folding could be a difficult process as often molecules adopt a spatial conformation that is very stable but not biologically functional, named a kinetic trap. RNA chaperones are non-specific RNA binding proteins that help RNA folding by resolving misfolded structures or preventing their formation. There is a large number of viruses whose genome is RNA that allows some evolutionary advantages, such as rapid genome mutation. On the other hand, regions of the viral RNA genomes can adopt different structural conformations, some of them lacking functional relevance and acting as misfolded intermediates. In fact, for an efficient replication, they often require RNA chaperone activities. There is a growing list of RNA chaperones encoded by viruses involved in different steps of the viral cycle. Also, cellular RNA chaperones have been involved in replication of RNA viruses. This review briefly describes RNA chaperone activities and is focused in the roles that viral or cellular nucleic acid chaperones have in RNA virus replication, particularly in those viruses that require discontinuous RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Z\u00FA\u00F1iga, Sonia; Sola, Isabel; Cruz, Jazmina L.G.; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00f12a2adcfe8f8f62edfcad80b541c44692f2fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114511.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18675859/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208002414; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208002414","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA folding","replication of RNA viruses","cellular RNA chaperones","viral RNA genomes","RNA virus replication","RNA chaperone activities","Abstract RNA molecules","discontinuous RNA synthesis","growing list of RNA chaperones","non-specific RNA binding proteins","cellular nucleic acid chaperones","viral cycle","efficient replication","large number of viruses","different structural conformations","rapid genome mutation","rapid regulation","different steps","functional relevance","misfolded intermediates","misfolded structures","extreme structural flexibility","roles","evolutionary advantages","difficult process","regions","spatial conformation","refolding","hand","review","kinetic trap","fact"],"language":"en"},

We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis in puppies from a dog kennel in Victoria, Australia. The near complete genome of a canine astrovirus was obtained from pooled faecal samples, and was found to be 94.7% identical with a canine astrovirus detected in the United Kingdom in 2012. The phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene found similarities to those of canine astroviruses identified in Italy in 2005 and in UK and Hungary in 2012, but distant from that of a canine astrovirus previously identified in Australia in 2012. Thus, different serotypes of canine astrovirus are likely circulating in Australia. The close relationship to European astroviruses also suggested that there had been recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses between Australia and Europe. NGS also detected other infections in the puppies including several canine papillomaviruses and a canine parvovirus (vaccine strain) as well as a very low level of campylobacter. Canine astrovirus was the probable cause of diarrhoea in these puppies, with the possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria. NGS was effective as a non-targeted method to determine the likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhatta, Tarka Raj; Chamings, Anthony; Vibin, Jessy; Alexandersen, Soren","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/999baa06c2bdc67ba7e4707ddcf5b3b296f85985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6418273.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41045-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":["Australia","Hungary","Europe"],"keyphrases":["canine parvovirus","canine papillomaviruses","different serotypes of canine astrovirus","Australia","puppies","recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses","NGS","likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis","possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis","non- infectious aetiologies","European astroviruses","possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria","non-targeted method","probable cause of diarrhoea","low level of campylobacter","clinical presentation","similarities","dog kennel","capsid gene","young animals","Victoria","near complete genome","phylogenetic analysis","pooled faecal samples","vaccine strain","close relationship","Italy","United Kingdom","infections","UK","Hungary","generation sequencing"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection. STUDY DESIGN: The performance of FilmArray Respiratory Panel, AnyplexII RV16, and Argene was compared using clinical respiratory samples (n = 224, comprising 189 nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and 35 endotracheal aspirates), based on common overlapping targets across the platforms. Influenza A \u201Cequivocal\u201D and \u201Cno-subtype\u201D samples by FilmArray were further compared to a laboratory-developed Influenza A/B test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The overall performance of all three platforms appeared to be comparable with regards to sensitivities (95.8\u201397.9%) and specificities (96.1\u201398.0%), detection of coinfections, and distinguishment of influenza from non-influenza cases. \u201CEquivocal\u201D and \u201Cno-subtype\u201D samples by FilmArray mostly represented weak Influenza A by laboratory-developed test. Lower respiratory tract samples had comparable final-run success-rates and discordant-rates as compared to UTM. Coronavirus HKU1, which was not targeted by AnyplexII RV16, were detected as OC43.

This paper describes the particular analyses of the transcriptome of human lung tissue that was infected by SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV). Random primers were used to produce ESTs from total RNA samples of the lung tissue. The result showed a high diversity of the transcripts, covering much of the human genome, including loci which do not contain protein coding sequences. 10,801 ESTs were generated and assembled into 267 contigs plus 7,659 singletons. Sequences matching to SARS\u2010CoV RNAs and other pneumonia\u2010related microbes were found. The transcripts were well classified by functional annotation. Among the 7,872 assembled sequences that were identified as from human genome, 578 non\u2010coding genes were revealed by BLAST search. The transcripts were mapped to the human genome with the restriction of identity = 100%, which found a candidate pool of 448 novel transcriptional loci where EST transcriptional signal was never found before. Among these, 13 loci were never reported to be transcriptional by other detection methods such as gene chips, tiling arrays, and paired\u2010end ditags (PETs).

By examining the effects of virus infection on gene expression, and interactions between virus and vector, new targets for prevention of infection and novel treatments may be identified in mosquitoes. We previously performed a microarray analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome during infection with DENV and found that mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881 (AAEL003881) was specifically and highly down-regulated. Ubiquitin proteins have multiple functions in insects, including marking proteins for proteasomal degradation, regulating apoptosis and mediating innate immune signaling. Methods We used qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression and infection, and RNAi to reduce Ub3881 expression. Mosquitoes were infected with DENV through blood feeding. We transfected DENV protein expression constructs to examine the effect of Ub3881 on protein degradation. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transfection to determine what amino acids are involved in Ub3881-mediated protein degradation. Immunofluorescence, Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to examine protein interactions and co-localization. Results The overexpression of Ub3881, but not related ubiquitin proteins, decreased DENV infection in mosquito cells and live Ae. aegypti. The Ub3881 protein was demonstrated to be involved in DENV envelope protein degradation and reduce the number of infectious virions released. Conclusions We conclude that Ub3881 has several antiviral functions in the mosquito, including specific viral protein degradation. General significance Our data highlights Ub3881 as a target for future DENV prevention strategies in the mosquito transmission vector.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Troupin, Andrea; Londono-Renteria, Berlin; Conway, Michael J.; Cloherty, Erin; Jameson, Samuel; Higgs, Stephen; Vanlandingham, Dana L.; Fikrig, Erol; Colpitts, Tonya M.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ba4af47b206aeaee597ce7c4f4bf27db05ae87c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4949077.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416516301751; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.05.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27241849/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416516301751","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ub3881 protein","mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881","Ub3881 expression","Ub3881-mediated protein degradation","DENV envelope protein degradation","DENV protein expression constructs","protein interactions","effect of Ub3881","overexpression of Ub3881","decreased DENV infection","specific viral protein degradation","prevention of infection","data highlights Ub3881","mosquito cells","effects of virus infection","gene expression","proteasomal degradation","future DENV prevention strategies","mosquito transmission vector","related ubiquitin proteins","marking proteins","mosquitoes","multiple functions","Abstract Background Dengue virus","antiviral functions","Co-immunoprecipitation","co-localization","Aedes aegypti transcriptome","insects","new targets","Western blotting","mortality","significant human disease","apoptosis","RNAi","qRT-PCR","novel treatments","transfection","Immunofluorescence","microarray analysis","flavivirus","amino acids","General significance","AAEL003881","number of infectious virions","mutagenesis","innate immune","blood feeding","site","subtropics","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Worldwide, the 2017-18 epidemic proved to be the most severe since 2003-04. We report a real-world experience regarding the management of patients with influenza admitted to a large teaching hospital in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region during the 2017-2018 influenza season. We also provide a practical guide for the management of hospitalized influenza patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted among all influenza patients requiring admission to our center during the 2017-18 season. RESULTS: Overall, 29 patients were admitted to the University Hospital of Udine during the 2017-18 season with a diagnosis of influenza. B virus was responsible for the majority of cases. More than 65.5% of the subjects presented with a complication. We estimated that 41.4% of the patients admitted were affected by a \u201Csevere form\u201D. All these cases required admission to the Intensive Care Unit, with 27.6% and 10.3% needing Orotracheal Intubation and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, respectively. The fatality rate was 24.1%. Notably, only 9 subjects in our cohort had been vaccinated. Based on the experience acquired during the past season, we propose a practical guide to the management of influenza cases in everyday hospital practice. CONCLUSION: The cornerstones of the management of all hospitalized influenza patients are the rapid identification and treatment of severe forms. Timely and strict adherence to contact and respiratory precautions are also fundamental to reducing the risk of intra-hospital outbreaks. Despite improvements in antiviral therapies and supportive measures, influenza-related morbidity and mortality remain high. In our opinion, a universal vaccination program is the only safe and effective method of filling the gap.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"BASSETTI, M.; PEGHIN, M.; GALLO, T.; PIPAN, C.; D\u2019AGARO, P.; SARTOR, A.; BOVE, T.; COCCONI, R.; GRAZIANO, E.; CASTALDO, N.","journal":"J Prev Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03e8628eb61ff4c66a17673745a7b9c33aece853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6797893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650049/; https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2019.60.3.1314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"],"locations":["Friuli Venezia Giulia"],"keyphrases":["influenza season","management of influenza cases","management of hospitalized influenza patients","diagnosis of influenza","management of patients","influenza-related morbidity","hospital settings","past season","large teaching hospital","everyday hospital practice","University Hospital of Udine","practical guide","risk of intra-hospital outbreaks","majority of cases","admission","subjects","treatment of severe forms","real-world experience","supportive measures","rapid identification","Friuli Venezia Giulia region","antiviral therapies","matter of serious concern","universal vaccination program","strict adherence","respiratory precautions","Orotracheal Intubation","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","clinicians","improvements","outpatient","retrospective observational analysis","mortality","center","Intensive Care Unit","effective method","B virus","opinion","METHODS","cornerstones","gap","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","fatality rate","complication","cohort","epidemic","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, these bat-associated pathogens cause little, if any, clinicopathology in bats. This long-term adaptation should be reflected somewhat in the immune system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the first line of immune defense against pathogens in vertebrates. Therefore, this study focuses on the selection of TLRs involved in virus recognition. The coding sequences of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were sequenced in ten bats. The selection pressure acting on each gene was also detected using branch- and site-specific methods. The results showed that the ancestor of bats and certain other bat sublineages evolved under positive selection for TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. The highest proportion of positive selection occurred in TLR9, followed by TLR8 and TLR7. All of the positively selected sites were located in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which implied their important roles in pathogen recognition. However, TLR3 evolved under negative selection. Our results are not in line with previous studies which identified more positively selected sites in TLR8 in mammalian species. In this study, the most positively selected sites were found in TLR9. This study encompassed more species that were considered natural reservoirs of viruses. The positive selection for TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 might contribute to the adaptation of pathogen-host interaction in bats, especially in bat TLR9.

RESULTS: On admission, the patients generally complained of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue, with diarrhea often present in severe cases. Severe patients were 20 years older on average and had comorbidities and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. There were no differences in the CT findings between asymptomatic and symptomatic common type patients or between afebrile and febrile patients, defined according to Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and CT features at admission may enable clinicians to promptly evaluate the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware that clinically silent cases may present with CT features similar to those of symptomatic common patients. KEY POINTS: \u2022 The clinical features and predominant patterns of abnormalities on CT for asymptomatic, typic common, and severe cases were summarized. These findings may help clinicians to identify severe patients quickly at admission. \u2022 Clinicians should be cautious that CT findings of afebrile/asymptomatic patients are not better than the findings of other types of patients. These patients should also be quarantined. \u2022 The use of chest CT as the main screening method in epidemic areas is recommended.

Despite the low pH of the gizzard, the duck influenza viruses reach the intestines via the digestive tract and are found in high concentration in the feces. The viruses retain infectivity in fecal material for at least 30 days at 4\u00B0 and for 7 days at 20\u00B0. The morphology of one strain of intestinal duck influenza virus (Hav7 Neg2) that had never been passed in embryonated eggs and was isolated from the feces was roughly spherical and fairly uniform in size and shape. However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0\u00B0 and for 4 days at 22\u00B0. The susceptibility of ducks to infection with human and avian strains of influenza virus and the possibility of transmission to animal species through the water supply suggests that ducks may be important in the ecology of influenza viruses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at this large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into one of four categories\u2014emergent, urgent, non-urgent or self-care\u2014 and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under two weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls and in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Judson, Timothy J; Odisho, Anobel Y; Neinstein, Aaron B; Chao, Jessica; Williams, Aimee; Miller, Christopher; Moriarty, Tim; Gleason, Nathaniel; Intinarelli, Gina; Gonzales, Ralph","journal":"J Am Med Inform Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3157731bd6813438f3c0b33fa258adb2fe706ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["self-care","self-scheduling tool","Patient self-triage tools","triage efficiency","Asymptomatic patients","primary care patients","unique patients","Symptomatic patient triage dispositions","unnecessary triage messages","decreased triage time","emergency-level care","direct scheduling","appropriate level of care","health systems","large academic health system","digital patient","patient portal-based COVID","electronic health record systems","unnecessary visits","pandemic","high sensitivity","person visits","completed sessions","phone calls","potential","exposure history","telephone hotline","CONCLUSION","severe illness","METHODS","times","categories","RESULTS","DISCUSSION","relevant information","populations","data","days of use","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVE","weeks","nonurgent"],"language":"en"},

Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm \u201CMapitope\u201D to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13\u201315-mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor.

Although the monomeric units are known to consist of three transmembrane (TM) domains, there are no solved structures available for the complete monomer. The present study proposes a structural model for the transmembrane region of the monomer by employing our previously tested approach, which predicts potential orientations of TM \u03B1-helices by minimizing the unfavorable contact surfaces between the different TM domains. The best model structure comprising all three \u03B1-helices has been subjected to MD simulations to examine its quality. The TM bundle was found to form a compact and stable structure with significant intermolecular interactions. The structural features of the proposed model of 3a account for observations from previous experimental investigations on the activity of the protein. Further analysis indicates that residues from the TM2 and TM3 domains are likely to line the pore of the ion channel, which is in good agreement with a recent experimental study. In the absence of an experimental structure for the protein, the proposed structure can serve as a useful model for inferring structure-function relationships about the protein.

Nucleic acid amplification tests could assist antibiotic targeting. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 645 patients presenting to primary care with acute cough and suspected ALRTI, provided throat swabs at baseline. These were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction and classified as having a respiratory virus, bacteria, both or neither. Three hundred fifty-four participants scored the symptoms severity daily for 1 week in a diary (0 = absent to 4 = severe problem). RESULTS: Organisms were identified in 346/645 (53.6%) participants. There were differences in the prevalence of seven symptoms between the organism groups at baseline. Those with a virus alone, and those with both virus and bacteria, had higher average severity scores of all symptoms combined during the week of follow-up than those in whom no organisms were detected [adjusted mean differences 0.204 (95% confidence interval 0.010 to 0.398) and 0.348 (0.098 to 0.598), respectively]. There were no differences in the duration of symptoms rated as moderate or severe between organism groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in presenting symptoms and symptoms severity can be identified between patients with viruses and bacteria identified on throat swabs. The magnitude of these differences is unlikely to influence management. Most patients had mild symptoms at 7 days regardless of aetiology, which could inform patients about likely symptom duration.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ord\u00F3\u00F1ez-Mena, Jos\u00E9 M; Fanshawe, Thomas R; Butler, Chris C; Mant, David; Longhurst, Denise; Muir, Peter; Vipond, Barry; Little, Paul; Moore, Michael; Stuart, Beth; Hay, Alastair D; Thornton, Hannah V; Thompson, Matthew J; Smith, Sue; Van den Bruel, Ann; Hardy, Victoria; Cheah, Laikin; Crook, Derrick; Knox, Kyle","journal":"Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac65c7f71a49d05c3cdbdcf0811cd0ff98d2d23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108489.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmz093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms severity","duration of symptoms","presenting symptoms","mild symptoms","patients","bacteria","respiratory virus","mean differences","primary care","respiratory pathogens","aetiology","throat swabs","organism groups","baseline","Organisms","participants","Acute lower respiratory tract infections","acute cough","higher average severity scores","severe problem","week of follow-up","likely symptom duration","ALRTIs","suspected ALRTI","patient concerns","account","real-time polymerase chain reaction","clinician uncertainty","antibiotics","BACKGROUND","Nucleic acid amplification tests","antibiotic targeting","lack of efficacy","prospective cohort study","illness course","days","viruses","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","prevalence","confidence interval","diary","magnitude","management","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Despite this, the origins of the invasion remain unknown, as do the origins of its parasites. This study provides the full annotated mitochondrial genome (15,460 bp) of D. haemobaphes, consisting of 2 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs and 14 protein coding genes. Mitochondrial genes from the UK isolate are compared to existing data on NCBI and are used in a concatenated phylogenetic approach and identify D. haemobaphes as an early member of the Gammaridae (Amphipoda). Viral, bacterial, protistan and microsporidian parasites are present across the Gammaridae, including D. haemobaphes, suggesting the ancestor of the Gammaridae harboured related diseases, and that further screening of amphipods is likely to reveal further microparasite diversity. This correlation suggests that other gammarid invaders have the potential to harbour a range of microparasites.

Ampligen\u00AE, currently under development by Hemispherx Biopharma in the US, acts on the immunological system through T-lymphocyte stimulation and is indicated for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as part of the combined therapy. Ampligen\u00AE is available for licensing worldwide. In February 2004, Fujisawa Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., entered into an option agreement with Hemispherx Biopharma with the intent of becoming a distributor for Ampligen\u00AE for the potential treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. An option fee of \u20AC400 000 was paid pursuant to the terms of the option agreement and upon execution of the Distribution Agreement, Fujisawa will pay Hemispherx fees and milestone payments with a potential worth of several millions of dollars.[1] In September 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma Inc. entered into an agreement with Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation to organise clinical trials, marketing, sales and distribution for both of its lead compounds, Ampligen\u00AE and Alferon N\u00AE in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The agreement stipulates that the Guangdong Medicine Group Corporation (GMC) will conduct clinical trials with Ampligen\u00AE for the treatment of HIV. All costs related to the trials are to be covered by GMC. Additionally, GMC has to develop and implement marketing and promotional programmes.[2] In May 2003, Hemispherx Biopharma and the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy entered into a research project agreement that will see Ampligen\u00AE implemented in a protocol used in patients with relapsed EBV-positive Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma.[3] In March 2002, Esteve and Hemispherx Biopharma entered into a collaborative agreement under which Esteve will be the sole distributor of Ampligen\u00AE in Spain, Portugal and Andorra for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Under this agreement, in addition to other terms, Esteve will also collaborate in the drug product development by conducting clinical studies in Spain in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. In July 2001 Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it had formed a strategic alliance with Empire Health Resources for clinical trials of Ampligen\u00AE in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. Empire Health Resources, a healthcare management firm, will be responsible for accrual and retention of patients for HIV trials, and protocols for trials in patients with hepatitis C or both HIV and hepatitis C infections. Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen\u00AE. Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories. Hemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen\u00AE for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen\u00AE in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland. In the US, Ampligen\u00AE has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II). In August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen\u00AE and Oragens\u2122. Previously, Hemispherx submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of Ampligen\u00AE for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of the regulatory review has been cleared. In 2000, Hemispherx Europe (Hemispherx) obtained orphan drug status for Ampligen\u00AE for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in the EU, providing Hemispherx with 10 years of marketing exclusivity following the launch of the drug, as well as potential financial research benefits for the agent. In February 2000, Crystaal Corporation (now Biovail Pharmaceuticals Canada) acquired exclusive marketing rights to Ampligen\u00AE in Canada, where it submitted an NDA for the agent for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. In the meantime, Ampligen\u00AE has been available since May 1996 under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Programme for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and immune dysfunction syndrome by Rivex Pharma (Helix BioPharma). Bioclones has initiated clinical studies with Ampligen\u00AE for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Australia. The active substance for Ampligen\u00AE is manufactured by F.H. Faulding Ltd. Clinical treatment programmes for chronic fatigue syndrome in other Pacific Rim countries are planned. Ampligen\u00AE is available for severe chronic fatigue syndrome on a named patient, cost-recovery basis in South Africa. Hemispherx has developed a \u2018ready-to-use\u2019 liquid formulation of the drug and has begun treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in ongoing clinical trials. Hemispherx has also developed an oral version of the drug (Oragen\u00AE), which is undergoing preclinical evaluation. In February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen\u00AE in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options. In July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen\u00AE was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen\u00AE for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen\u00AE to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. \u2018Several hundred\u2019 patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen\u00AE on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002. NIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen\u00AE as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen\u00AE demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 \u03BCg/mL) and had a favourable safety profile.[4] In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promsing new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen\u00AE and Alferon N\u00AE.[5] Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen\u00AE against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen\u00AE was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates.[6] Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen\u00AE was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon.[7] In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen\u00AE for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.","publish_time":"2012-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Drugs R

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who were admitted to the 32-bed medico-surgical ICU of a community and referral university hospital between 2002 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on variables available at admission. RESULTS: Among the 77 adult patients with severe CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who required ICU management, 12 patients died (observed mortality rate 15.6 %). Univariate analysis indicated that septic shock and low C-reactive protein (CRP) values at admission were associated with an increased risk of death. In a multivariate model, after adjustment for age and gender, septic shock [odds ratio (OR), confidence interval 95 %; 4.96, 1.11\u201322.25; p = 0.036], and CRP (OR 0.99, 0.98\u20130.99 p = 0.034) remained significantly associated with death. Finally, we assessed the discriminative ability of CRP to predict mortality by computing its receiver operating characteristic curve. The CRP value cut-off for the best sensitivity and specificity was 169.5 mg/L to predict hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.72 (0.55\u20130.89). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of patients with S. pneumoniae CAP requiring ICU management was much lower than predicted by severity scores.

Intestinal transplantation has evolved from an experimental therapy to a highly successful treatment for children with intestinal failure who have complications with total parenteral nutrition. Because of continued success with intestinal transplantation over the past decade, the focus of clinicians and researchers is shifting from short-term patient survival to optimizing long-term outcomes. Current 5-year patient and graft survival rates after intestinal transplantation are 58% and 40%, respectively, in the US; single centers have reported nearly 80% patient and 60% graft survival rates at 5 years. The immunosuppression strategy in intestinal transplantation includes a tacrolimus-based regimen, usually in conjunction with an antibody induction therapy such as rabbit-antithymocyte globulin, interleukin-2 receptor antagonists, or alemtuzumab. The use of these immunosuppressive regimens, along with improved medical and surgical care, has contributed significantly toward improved outcomes. Optimization of post-transplant immunosuppression strategies to reduce adverse effects while minimizing acute and chronic graft rejection is a strong clinical and research focus.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayyar, Navdeep S.; McGhee, William; Martin, Dolly; Sindhi, Rakesh; Soltys, Kyle; Bond, Geoffrey; Mazariegos, George V.","journal":"Paediatr Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/984f96c2251f7018cf1482c16e71f0b54c1035a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101554.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101554/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric intestinal transplantation","intestinal failure","patient survival","graft survival rates","improved outcomes","adverse effects of current immunosuppression strategies","immunosuppression strategy","use","year patient","chronic graft rejection","Optimization of post-transplant immunosuppression strategies","experimental therapy","focus of clinicians","research focus","antibody induction therapy","rabbit-antithymocyte globulin","complications","successful treatment","past decade","interleukin","conjunction","children","receptor antagonists","tacrolimus-based regimen","total parenteral nutrition","immunosuppressive regimens","researchers","surgical care","continued success","years","single centers","alemtuzumab","review"],"language":"en"},

The processed grafts contained a mean of 5.5 \u00D7 10(7) cells/kg IBW, 4.7 \u00D7 10(6) CD34\u002B cells/kg IBW, and 6.3 \u00D7 10(5) CD3\u002Bcells/kg IBW.

Graft failure was statistically significantly associated with nonmalignant diagnosis (P\u003C0.001), but was not associated with CMV seropositivity, donor gender, or cell counts of the allograft. We conclude that although time to engraftment is similar to that seen with unmanipulated grafts, graft failure remains a significant problem in patients with hereditary, nonmalignant diseases.

While pneumonia is commonly observed during RSV infection, the burden and epidemiology of bacterial superinfection is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms associated with RSV-positive pneumonia in adults. A retrospective study was conducted during three consecutive winters (October to April 2013\u20132016) in the University Hospital of Lyon, France. During RSV circulation periods, a systematic RSV screening was performed by reverse-transcription PCR on all respiratory samples collected from adults. Records of RSV-positive patients were subsequently analyzed to identify radiologically confirmed pneumonia cases. Bacteria were identified by standard bacteriology cultures or urinary antigen screening and classified as potentially causative of pneumonia if quantification was above the specific threshold as defined by the European Manual of Clinical Microbiology. Overall, 14,792 adult respiratory samples were screened for RSV detection by PCR. In total, 292 had a positive RSV detection (2.0%) among which 89 presented with pneumonia including 27 bacterial superinfections (9.3%) with Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most patients were elderly (55.6%) and patients with comorbidities (77.8%). A more severe outcome was observed for RSV-bacteria-associated pneumonia compared with RSV pneumonia: length of stay was significantly longer (16 days vs 10 days) and ICU hospitalization more frequent (66.7% vs 21.0%) (p \u003C 0.05). In conclusion, we did not observe major differences in the epidemiology of bacterial superinfections in RSV-positive pneumonia compared to reports on post-influenza pneumonia.","publish_time":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeanno\u00EBl, M.; Lina, G.; Rasigade, J.

The disease is spread worldwide and is usually benign but, in some groups of population like pregnant women, can have a severe outcome. Due to a not optimal vaccination coverage, a relatively high number of childbearing-aged women in a European country such as Italy tested seronegative for VZV and so are currently at risk of acquiring chickenpox during pregnancy, especially if they live in contact with children for family or work reasons. Only few data are available about the risk of infection in this setting: the incidence of chickenpox may range from 1.5 to 4.6 cases/1000 childbearing females and from 1.21 to 6 cases/10,000 pregnant women, respectively. This review is aimed to focus on the epidemiology and the clinical management of exposure to chickenpox during pregnancy. Particular emphasis is given to the accurate screening of childbearing women at the time of the first gynecological approach \u2014 the females who tested susceptible to infection can be counseled about the risks and instructed on procedure should contact occur \u2014 and to the early prophylaxis of the at-risk exposure. Lastly, the achievement of adequate vaccination coverage of the Italian population remains a cornerstone in the prevention of chickenpox in pregnancy.","publish_time":"2018-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parente, Serena; Moriello, Nicola Schiano; Maraolo, Alberto Enrico; Tosone, Grazia","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ee935044ed8288d888c5b47bbb1c1220b6a7dbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnant women","prevention of chickenpox","incidence of chickenpox","pregnancy","risk of acquiring chickenpox","aged women","risk of infection","childbearing females","accurate screening of childbearing women","VZV","cases","contact","high number of childbearing","optimal vaccination coverage","Italian population","achievement of adequate vaccination coverage","groups of population","at-risk exposure","contagious disease","primary infection of varicella zoster virus","clinical management of exposure","European country","time","children","family","Italy","cornerstone","setting","work reasons","gynecological approach","early prophylaxis","epidemiology","Particular emphasis","severe outcome","data","risks","procedure","review"],"language":"en"},

The most effective antifibrotic strategy is to cure the underlying disease process before advanced fibrosis has developed. Unfortunately, this is often not possible, and specific antifibrotic therapies are needed. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis have identified several potential novel therapeutic targets, but unfortunately clinical development has been disappointing. One major limitation has been the often prolonged natural history of fibrosis compared to experimental models, and difficulties in accurate noninvasive fibrosis assessment, thus making clinical trial design difficult.

RECENT FINDINGS: Acute HBVinfection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). Spontaneous survival at this stage is poor. It is urgent to distinguish between these two entities so that antiviral therapy can be initiated rapidly. Although the indications for antiviral therapy are clear for HBV reactivation, there is no true consensus regarding ALI/FH related to acute HBV infection. The global management of HBV-related FH does not differ from that implemented for other causes of FH, i.e. close cardiorespiratory and neurological monitoring, treatment with acetylcysteine, organ support in the event of organ failure (haemodynamic, renal, respiratory) and albumin dialysis. Liver transplantation remains the only alternative when certain criteria for a poor prognosis are met. A recurrence of HBV infection on the graft can be prevented post-transplant by the administration of HBIG and antiviral therapy for HBV, the modalities varying depending on the risk of recurrence.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichai, Philippe; Samuel, Didier","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/161b7369eeec209a321f393c86428b32f706749a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101741.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV-ALI/FH","HBV","HBIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute HBV infection","HBV-ALI","acute exacerbations of chronic HBV infection","recurrence of HBV infection","Acute HBVinfection","HBV reactivation","acute liver injury","related FH","global management of HBV","causes of FH","acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection","antiviral therapy","Liver transplantation","fulminant hepatitis","poor prognosis","stage","spontaneous survival","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","organ support","risk of recurrence","event of organ failure","overview of specific management of patients","treatment","acetylcysteine","neurological monitoring","administration of HBIG","alternative","graft","certain criteria","true consensus","RECENT FINDINGS","post-transplant","modalities","albumin dialysis","entities","indications"],"language":"en"},

Median time to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u2A7E500/\u03BCl was 17 days vs 41 and 49 days in historical alloBMT patients with G-CSF (n = 23) or no cytokine (n = 29) post-transplant, respectively (P \u003C 0.0001). CD4/CD8(\u002B) ratio was 1.9 on day 28 after alloBSCT, then gradually declined to 0.8 at 1 year due to more rapid CD8(\u002B) cell recovery.

Since the discovery of anti-contractile effect of PVAT in 1991, the use of multiple rodent models of reduced amounts of PVAT has revealed its regulatory role in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular implications, including atherosclerosis. PVAT does not only release PVAT-derived relaxing factors (PVRFs) to activate multiple subsets of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potassium channels and anti-inflammatory signals in the vasculature, but it does also provide an interface for neuron-adipocyte interactions in the vascular wall to regulate arterial vascular tone.

A literature review was undertaken to determine the feasibility and safety of TIPS in the treatment of PVT. All studies in which TIPS was attempted in patients with PVT were identified by searching through the PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. A total of 424 PVT patients undergoing TIPS were reported in 54 articles. The success rate of TIPS insertion was 67\u2013100% in 19 case series. Further, 85 patients with portal cavernoma underwent successful TIPS insertions. Three therapeutic strategies of TIPS placement were used: (1) TIPS placement followed by portal vein recanalization via the shunt, (2) portal vein recanalization via percutaneous approaches followed by TIPS placement, and (3) TIPS insertion between a hepatic vein and a large collateral vessel without portal vein recanalization. Four approaches were used to access the portal vein: transjugular, transhepatic, transsplenic, and transmesenteric. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to hepatic capsule perforation was lethal in only three patients. No episode of pulmonary embolism was reported. Other procedure-related complications were reversible. The overall incidence of shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy was 8\u201333% and 0\u201350%, respectively. In conclusion, the reviewed studies uniformly support the feasibility and safety of TIPS for PVT even in the presence of portal cavernoma.

Fourteen patients had a chest radiograph performed within 24 h of the date of the FOB. Two radiographs showed no abnormalities of the lung parenchyma.

It is important to detect mutations in viral genes and analyze the clinical features of patients and viral shedding duration related to neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance. We collected clinical specimens from 31 hospitalized H7N9 patients and sequenced NA, PB2, HA, and M gene fragments. Of the 31 identified patients, 7 (22.6%) carried the R292K substitution in NA, 30 (96.8%), 3 (9.7%), and 5 (16.1%) carried E627K, Q591K, and D701N mutations in PB2, respectively, and 2 (6.5%) carried both E627K and D701N mutations in PB2. All 26 identified patients harbored Q226L mutations and possessed only a single arginine (R) at cleavage sites in the HA and a S31N mutation in M2. Among 7 NA-R292K mutated patients, 3 died and 4 were discharged. There was no significant difference in the days that patients started oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset between NA-R292K mutant and NA-R292 wild-type patients (median days, 7 vs 6, P = 0.374).

However, only a minority of them will have an HLA-identical sibling donor; unrelated donors, matched or partially mismatched, have been used successfully for patients lacking a related donor. Even though results with allogeneic transplants using unrelated donors are encouraging, the incidence of complications including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection or late graft failure is increased compared to identical sibling transplants. The combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) has been used as an effective preparative regimen for allogeneic transplants, however, the total dosage and dosing schedule of both the cyclophosphamide and TBI has varied significantly among studies. To decrease the rate of graft rejection and late graft failure with volunteer donors, we evaluated a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, days \u22128, \u22127, \u22126, \u22125) followed by fractionated TBI (1400 cGy administered in eight fractions over 4 days, days \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121). GVHD prophylaxis included FK506 and methotrexate. From July 1993 to January 1996, 43 adult patients, median age 38 years (range 18\u201358 years), were treated with this preparative regimen. Seventeen patients had low-risk disease and 26 had high-risk disease. Thirty-one donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Seven additional pairs were minor mismatched at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Four other donor/recipient pairs were HLA-A,-B, and -DR identical by serology but allele mismatched at either DRB1 or DQB. Forty patients were evaluable for myeloid engraftment. Engraftment occurred in all 40 patients at a median of 19 days. There were no cases of graft rejection or late graft failure. Nephrotoxicity was the primary adverse event with 26 patients (60%) experiencing a doubling of their creatinine. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in seven patients, six of whom had high-risk disease. All patients who had relapsed or refractory disease prior to BMT achieved a complete remission following BMT. Six patients transplanted for high-risk disease relapsed a median of 377 days post-BMT.

Modern therapeutic approaches are still not satisfactory and shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure remain the great challenge in intensive care medicine. However, the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or psoriasis also represents an unresolved problem. Many factors contribute to the complex course of inflammatory reactions. Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the inflammatory response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of interleukins and lipid-mediators are released and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. Arachidonic acid (AA), the mother substance of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids in the course of inflammatory activation and is metabolised to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Various strategies have been evaluated to control the excessive production of lipid mediators on different levels of biochemical pathways, such as inhibition of phospholipase A(2), the trigger enzyme for release of AA, blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and the development of receptor antagonists against platelet activating factor and leukotrienes. Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so. Encouraging results have been obtained by dietary supplementation with long chain \u03C9-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for enzymatic metabolism inducing the production of less inflammatory and chemotactic derivatives.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heller, Axel; Koch, Thea; Schmeck, Joachim; van Ackern, Klaus","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce4bde08cb7e899ebf6061f3d369e81e94087113.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory response","different inflammatory disorders","acute inflammatory disorders","course of inflammatory activation","treatment of inflammatory diseases","pro-inflammatory eicosanoids","complex course of inflammatory reactions","lipid-mediators","excessive production of lipid mediators","multiple organ failure","septic organ failure","rheumatoid arthritis","release of AA","cellular mediators","EPA","leukotrienes","pathogenesis of organ dysfunction","different levels of biochemical pathways","lipoxygenase pathways","toxic agents","eicosapentaenoic acid","states of inflammation","Arachidonic acid","intensive collaborative research","excessive amounts of interleukins","intensive care medicine","early phase of inflammation","fatty acids","great challenge","long chain \u03C9","fields of chronic","development of receptor antagonists","psoriasis","blockade of cyclooxygenase","shock","ulcerative colitis","mother substance","dietary supplementation","platelet","sepsis","membrane phospholipids","protective effects","better understanding","variety of humoral","pathophysiology","diagnosis","past","decades","crucial role","asthma","trigger enzyme","Modern therapeutic approaches","enzymatic metabolism","prostaglandins","chemotactic derivatives","unresolved problem","inhibition of phospholipase","results","factors","Various strategies"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, arctigenin pretreatment reduced the malondialdehyde level and increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and glutathione peroxidase/glutathione disulfide ratio in the lung. Mechanically, arctigenin significantly reduced the production of nitric oxygen and inducible nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS) expression, enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1, and decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

Following the identification of disseminated Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin (BCG) infections in Canadian First Nations, M\u00E9tis and Inuit (FNMI) children with unrecognized primary immune deficiencies, a national surveillance study was initiated in order to determine the incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of children with SCID in Canada. METHODS: Canadian pediatricians were asked to complete a monthly reporting form if they had seen a suspected SCID case, from 2004 to 2010, through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). If the case met CPSP SCID criteria, more detailed data, including demographics and clinical information about investigations, treatment and outcome was collected. RESULTS: A total of 40 cases of SCID were confirmed for an estimated incidence of SCID in non-FNMI Canadian children of 1.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 1 to 1.9/100,000). The proportion of SCID cases that were FNMI (17.5 %) was almost three times higher than was expected on the basis of proportion of the pediatric population estimated to be FNMI (6.3 %) resulting in an estimated incidence of 4.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 2.1 to 9.2/100,000) in FNMI Canadian children. The mean age at diagnosis for all SCID cases was 4.2 months (range 1\u2013583 days). There were 12 deaths (30 %; 95 % CI 18\u201346 %); seven died of confirmed or suspected infections before they could receive an HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCID cases in FNMI children is higher than in the general Canadian pediatric population. The high mortality rate, due primarily to infection, suggests that early diagnosis by newborn screening followed by HSCT could significantly benefit children with SCID.","publish_time":"2013-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rozmus, Jacob; Junker, Anne; Thibodeau, Melanie Laffin; Grenier, Danielle; Turvey, Stuart E.; Yacoub, Wadieh; Embree, Joanne; Haddad, Elie; Langley, Joanne M.; Ramsingh, Rose Marie; Singh, Veeran-Anne; Long, Richard; Schultz, Kirk R.","journal":"J Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/229af8c663a86f265c7a1148d0bee38b331f1ca2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Canadian First Nations","SCID","HSCT"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["cases of SCID","FNMI children","proportion of SCID cases","estimated incidence of SCID","frequency of SCID cases","non-FNMI Canadian children","suspected SCID case","CPSP SCID criteria","outcome of children","Canadian pediatricians","HSCT","general Canadian pediatric population","Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program","early diagnosis","treatment","live births","suspected infections","basis of proportion","times higher","national surveillance study","unrecognized primary immune deficiencies","Severe Combined Immune Deficiency","BCG","detailed data","clinical information","Nations","Inuit","M\u00E9tis","identification of disseminated Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","demographics","investigations","order","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","PURPOSE","newborn screening","months","range","mean age","total","CONCLUSIONS","Canada","high mortality rate","monthly reporting form","days","RESULTS","METHODS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Lastly, we will review emerging data related to the use of cognitive rehabilitation, formation of postintensive care clinics in qualifying patients, and potential neuropharmacologic therapy. While our chapter focuses on cognitive impairment generally, it places a particular emphasis on executive dysfunction, not because impairment occurs solely in this domain but because impairments of an executive nature may be uniquely debilitating.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stollings, Joanna L.; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Jackson, James C.; Ely, E.

This study investigated the effect of PALM3 knockdown on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and its underlying mechanisms. We constructed a recombinant adenoviral vector containing short hairpin RNA for PALM3 to knockdown PALM3 expression. A transgene-free adenoviral vector was used as a negative control. The ALI rat model was established by LPS peritoneal injection at 48-h post-transfection. Results showed that downregulation of PALM3 improved the survival rate, attenuated lung pathological changes, alleviated pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of nuclear factor \u03BAB and interferon \u03B2 regulatory factor 3, and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in the ALI rat model. However, PALM3 knockdown had no effect on TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon \u03B2 (TRIF) expression. Moreover, PALM3 knockdown reduced the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF induced by LPS in rat lungs. Therefore, the downregulation of PALM3 protected rats from LPS-induced ALI and its mechanisms were partially associated with the modulation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complex formation.","publish_time":"2017-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xuxin; Tang, Lu; Feng, Jian; Wang, Yi; Han, Zhihai; Meng, Jiguang","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f559c365b058f58fcb065cae456c3fe3aff67a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["knockdown PALM3 expression","downregulation of PALM3","effect of PALM3 knockdown","LPS-induced ALI","MyD88","ALI rat model","inhibition of TLR4","interaction of TLR4","interferon \u03B2 regulatory factor","LPS peritoneal injection","Toll-interleukin","expression of suppressor","rat lungs","lung vascular leakage","acute lung injury","myeloid differentiation factor","recombinant adenoviral vector","TRIF complex formation","attenuated lung pathological changes","activation of nuclear factor \u03BAB","transgene-free adenoviral vector","receptor domain","secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin","underlying mechanisms","alleviated pulmonary edema","short hairpin RNA","survival rate","neutrophil infiltration","production of proinflammatory cytokines","adaptor","lipopolysaccharide","rats","modulation of inflammatory responses","h post-transfection","paralemmin","study","negative control","Previous studies","Results"],"language":"en"},

Between 50% and 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated with viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), yet the influence of viral pathogen diversity on asthma outcomes is poorly understood because of the limited scope and throughput of conventional viral detection methods. Methods. We investigated the capability of the Virochip, a DNA microarray\u2014based viral detection platform, to characterize viral diversity in RTIs in adults with and without asthma. Results. The Virochip detected viruses in a higher proportion of samples (65%) than did culture isolation (17%) while exhibiting high concordance (98%) with and comparable sensitivity (97%) and specificity (98%) to pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction. A similar spectrum of viruses was identified in the RTIs of each patient subgroup; however, unexpected diversity among human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) was revealed. All but one of the HCoVs corresponded to the newly recognized HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses, and \u003E20 different serotypes of HRVs were detected, including a set of 5 divergent isolates that formed a distinct genetic subgroup. Conclusions. The Virochip can detect both known and novel variants of viral pathogens present in RTIs. Given the diversity detected here, larger-scale studies will be necessary to determine whether particular substrains of viruses confer an elevated risk of asthma exacerbation.","publish_time":"2007-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kistler, Amy; Avila, Pedro C.; Rouskin, Silvi; Wang, David; Ward, Theresa; Yagi, Shigeo; Schnurr, David; Ganem, Don; DeRisi, Joseph L.; Boushey, Homer A.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/573a2c535a79383fce66eb8da783a1b4942d3fbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral diversity","RTIs","influence of viral pathogen diversity","viral detection platform","Virochip","unexpected diversity","asthma outcomes","asthma exacerbations","throughput of conventional viral detection methods","HCoV-HKU1 viruses","viral respiratory tract infections","novel variants of viral pathogens present","HCoVs","particular substrains of viruses","similar spectrum of viruses","elevated risk of asthma exacerbation","human coronaviruses","human rhinoviruses","patient subgroup","recognized HCoV-NL63","distinct genetic subgroup","different serotypes of HRVs","pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction","DNA microarray","limited scope","divergent isolates","adults","larger-scale studies","higher proportion of samples","set","specificity","capability","comparable sensitivity","culture isolation","high concordance","Background","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Utilizing fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, we have examined human post-mortem tissues for the presence of immediate early and late viral gene expression in multiple sclerosis patient normal appearing white matter (NAWM), lesional tissue and normal control brain samples. HHV-6 gene transcription was detected in all tissue samples and was restricted to oligodendrocytes, as determined by double mRNA FISH analysis. Quantitative analysis of viral mRNA expression indicated that both NAWM and lesional multiple sclerosis samples exhibited significantly higher levels of HHV-6 expression compared with the normal control samples. Lesional samples exhibited the highest levels of viral gene expression, with NAWM exhibiting an intermediate level between lesional and control tissues. Immunofluorescence against early and late HHV-6 proteins verified active translation of HHV-6 viral mRNA in oligodendrocytes.

The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.

Nucleocapsid isolated in this manner is amenable to ultrastructural evaluation, protein isolation for the production of monospecific hyperimmune serum, and genomic RNA isolation for cDNA cloning. Nucleocapsid (NC) and a defective NC variant (Df-NC) isolated from 5.5 \u00D7 107 Vero cells infected with Ond-CDV is readily visualized on cesium gradients. The calculated density for NC is 1.2976 \u00B1 0.0033 g/ml and 1.2458 \u00B1 0.0056 g/ml for Df-NC. Ultrastructurally, NC appears as long uninterrupted strands, 1.6 \u00B1 0.1 \u03BCm in length, 21.2 \u00B1 1.7 nm in diameter, with well defined capsid subunits. Df-NC are truncated with a uniform length of 85.8 \u00B1 7.1 nm and a 24.5 \u00B1 1.3 nm diameter. A total of 2.1 \u00B1 0.2 \u03BC of NC protein is obtained for every 1 \u00D7 106 cells infected; 89.7% of this mass is represented by a 61 kDa protein (N), 8.4% by a 75 kDa protein (P), and 1.9% by a 160\u2013200 kDa protein (L), which is in agreement with the NC constituency of other paramyxoviruses. Viral N and P proteins, purified by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, were used in the production of hyperimmune serum. Specificity was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were capable of detecting viral antigen in persistently and lytically CDV infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. A single high molecular weight species of nucleic acid was isolated from purified nucleocapsids compatible with a 14.6 kb morbillivirus genome.

Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV \u201Ca threat to the entire world.\u201D This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered.","publish_time":"2013-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fc5801b4cdc21c018c93aa3cbc9b601491fdeb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3747588.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00531-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23963179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Margaret Chan"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["human infection","MERS-CoV epidemic","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","person","patients","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","World Health Organization","human populations","severe disease","entire world","ultimate source","public health officials","Margaret Chan","Director-General","details","pathological features","establishment","prevalence","close relationship","immune basis","lethal pneumonia","small rodent model","bat coronaviruses","animals","alarm bells","years","threat","travelers","article reviews","progress","identification","cause","region","months","key issues","cases","deaths","biology","questions"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To test if high-density resequencing microarray can be applied to detection of viruses in conjunctival swabs for patients with conjunctivitis. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective proof-of-concept study, every 4 or 5 bacterial culture-negative conjunctival swab samples were pooled and subject to viral detection using TessArray\u2122 Resequencing Pathogen Microarrays-Flu 3.1 (RPM-Flu-3.1). Results were compared with human adenovirus (HAdV) hexon gene PCR sequencing and viral culture. RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 38 conjunctival swab samples were bacterial culture-negative. Four of the 7 pooled samples were positive for HAdV using RPM-Flu-3.1. Hexon gene PCR sequencing on the 38 original individual samples showed that 3 and 4 samples contained HAdVs species D and B respectively. All the 6 samples that were positive for hexon gene PCR but negative for bacterial culture were also positive by the resequencing microarray. Viral culture was positive for HAdV type 3 in 1 sample, which was also positive by PCR and resequencing microarray. CONCLUSIONS: Resequencing microarray is as sensitive as PCR for detection of HAdV in conjunctival swabs. Unlike viral culture and hexon gene PCR sequencing, resequencing microarray was not able to differentiate the type and species of HAdV. Development of microarrays for conjunctivitis can be performed for rapid diagnosis of the viral cause of conjunctivitis.","publish_time":"2010-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Lau, Susanna K.P.; Choi, Garnet K.Y.; Fung, Hin-Tat; Shek, Kam-Chuen; Miao, Ji; Chan, Benedict Y.L.; Ng, Kenneth H.L.; Ngan, Antonio H.Y.; Ellis-Behnke, Rutledge; Que, Tak-Lun; Kam, Chak-Wah; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1417e20893d38c3c99c96286bce5f4a12470bd33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071220/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209006052; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209006052; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.12.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral culture","viral detection","detection of HAdV","high-density resequencing microarray","hexon gene PCR sequencing","detection of viruses","bacterial culture-negative conjunctival swab samples","pooled samples","HAdV type","species of HAdV","viral cause of conjunctivitis","Resequencing Pathogen Microarrays-Flu","conjunctival swabs","original individual samples","RPM-Flu","evolution of viruses","patients","Results","STUDY DESIGN","concept study","Development of microarrays","HAdVs species D","TessArray","subject","human adenovirus","prospective proof","respiratory tract infections","rapid diagnosis","report","technology","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced.

This study was performed to better understand the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2) and assess vaccine efficacy in Cameroon. Complete sequences of three gene segments were obtained from 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon. Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes of 35 A(H3N2) virus strains were amplified and sequenced. Predicted vaccine efficacy was measured using the P(epitope) model. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that all Cameroonian strains had evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade. Globally, 2014 virus strains clustered with the 2015\u20132016 vaccine strain, 3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, whereas 2015 and 2016 virus strains clustered with the 2016\u20132017 vaccine strain, 3C.2a-A/HongKong/4801/2014. In order to determine the genotypic drug susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors and amantadine, the NA and M2 protein coding sequences were analyzed. There was no strain with characteristic mutation for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, per contra; all strains possessed the substitution S31N, peculiar of resistance to adamantanes. There was drift in influenza A(H3N2) dominant epitopes B (2014 and 2015) to epitopes A (2016) with a theoretical efficiency in vaccine ranging from low to moderate.

However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A\u0026B genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle was orally administered to the subject.

This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next \u2018Disease X\u2019. Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim(\u00AE)) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim(\u00AE) creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-\u03D2, leading to development of an \u201Canti-viral state\u201D, by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-\u03D2, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter. CONCLUSION: Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Har-Noy, Michael; Or, Reuven","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/793dda41fa0c1bc4f97eefe8b20cb04956a3f6fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215129.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02363-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral-specific Th1","viral disease","allo-specific memory cells","viral encounter","titer of allo","activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL","CTL memory cells","non-specific activation of allo","novel allo-priming approach","anti-viral vaccines","anti-viral state","lysed viral-infected cells","type of viral infection","early viral titer","CTL immunity","universal protection","pool of Th1","dominance of exhausted memory cells","expanded living Th1","stander activation of innate cellular effector cells","universal anti-virus vaccine","disease recurrence","Disease X","neutralizing antibody protection","progression","aged immune system","immunosenescence","aging immune system","healthy elderly adults","alternative approach","potential","vulnerable elderly population","inflammaging","immediate release of IFN","temporal immune events","counter-measure","sterilizing immunity","situ vaccination","circulation capable","context of IFN","healthy donors","case vaccination strategies","bio-economic terrorism","current outbreak of COVID","incalculable economic benefit","experimental cancer vaccine","Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim","release of endogenous heat shock proteins","HSP","DAMP","unknown biological threats","clinical use","cascade of spatial","society","order","development","causative SARS-CoV","future variants","back-up","pandemic","chronic inflammation","conditions","rationale","strategy","adjuvant","manner","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

From January to March 2003, faeces from a convenient sample of 879 5- to 30-day-old goat kids from 60 herds were examined microscopically after staining with carbol fuschin. Oocyst shedding was scored semi-quantitatively (0 to 4\u002B) allowing us to obtain a cumulative score per herd. Standardized questionnaires with information about management practices were collected in each farm. We found positive kids in 32 of 60 herds (53.3%) and in 142 animals out of 879 (16.2%). We used logistic regression for two risk-factor model: (1) simple positive (case: herd score \u22651\u002B, at least one positive kid in the herd, versus control: herd score=0), (2) strongly positive (case: overall herd score \u22653\u002B versus control: herd score \u003C3\u002B). Risk factors associated with simple positive herds were period of sampling compared to the peak of births (After versus Before, OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2, 15.3) and practice of kid grouping by age or weight (Yes versus No, OR=4.4, 95% CI 1.0, 19.1). Risk factors associated with strongly positive herds were period of investigation (February/March versus January, OR=12.7, 95% CI 2.1, 76.6), exposure to graminaceous plants in forage (OR=11.6, 95% CI 1.7, 81.0) and type of ventilation in the goat premises (Vertical versus Wind effect, OR=14.7, 95% CI 2.1, 106.1).

While, RNA dimerization of the HCV genome has been observed in vitro with short RNA sequences, the role of a putative RNA dimerization during viral replication has not been elucidated. To determine the effect of genomic dimerization on viral replication, we introduced mutations into SL2 predicted to disrupt genomic dimerization. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that mutations within the SL2 bulge impact dimerization in vitro. Transfection of Huh7 cells with luciferase-encoding full-length genomes containing SL2 mutations abolishes viral replication. Luciferase expression indicates that viral translation is not or slightly affected and that the viral RNA is properly encapsidated. However, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrates that viral RNA synthesis is drastically decreased. In vitro synthesis experiments using the viral recombinant polymerase show that modifications of intra-molecular interactions have no effect on RNA synthesis, while impairing inter-molecular interactions decreases polymerase activity. This confirms that dimeric templates are preferentially replicated by the viral polymerase. Altogether, these results indicate that the dimerization of the HCV genomic RNA is a crucial step for the viral life cycle especially for RNA replication. RNA dimerization could explain the existence of HCV recombinants in cell culture and patients reported recently in other studies.","publish_time":"2015-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masante, Cyril; Jaubert, Chlo\u00E9; Palau, William; Plissonneau, Jacqueline; Besnard, Lucie; Ventura, Michel; Di Primo, Carmelo","journal":"Cell Mol Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5e452559430ebf85efc7ce90bcc6a66c82ed580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822205/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-015-1893-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA synthesis","viral replication","RNA replication","viral polymerase","putative RNA dimerization","HCV genomic RNA","viral translation","viral recombinant polymerase","effect of genomic dimerization","viral life cycle","short RNA sequences","SL2 mutations","SL2 bulge impact dimerization","HCV genome","existence of HCV recombinants","Stem-loop SL2","molecular interactions","synthesis experiments","polymerase activity","Luciferase expression","hepatitis C virus genome","full-length genomes","crucial step","role","patients","self-interacting palindromic sequence","cell culture","modifications of","RT-qPCR analysis","Transfection of Huh7 cells","surface plasmon resonance","dimeric templates","studies","results"],"language":"en"},

Recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for IBV. Therefore we hypothesized that early IBV vaccination will generate an immature, poorly protective IBV-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of IBV. To test this hypothesis the IBV-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages. This demonstrated a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the 1, 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower IgA antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group. Similar observations were made for antibodies in tears. In addition, IgG antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds. The delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower IgG avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV field strain challenge. The lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group, while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected.

However, changes in the environment interfere with many of the major determinants of biological warfare (bioterrorism - biological attack). Four components are required for a biological attack: perpetrators, agents, mediums/means of delivery, and targets. Environmental changes caused by humans (auto-bioterrorism) and bioterrorism-related diseases they may impact are urbanization, agricultural intensification, de(re)forestation, water projects, and climate changes. Agroterrorism implies deliberate attack against commercial crops or livestock population. Agroterrorism is a multidimensional threat, involving a wide range of motives and perpetrators, and encompassing a wide range of actions, from single act of sabotage to strategic wartime programs with potentially disastrous spill-over\u0027 effects on susceptible wildlife and endangered species population. The threat of an agroterrorist attack depends on motivations and technical requirements of agroterrorism. Technical barriers to agroterrorism are lower than these to human-targeted bioterrorism. Terrorists\u0027 motives vary widely. The two most common are the profit motive and the anti-GMO (genetically modified organism) motive. The threat of an agroterrorist attack can be countered at four levels: (1) at the organism level, through animal or plant disease resistance; (2) at the farm level, through facility management techniques designed to prevent disease introduction or transmission; (3) at the agricultural sector level, through disease detection and response procedures; (4) at the national level, through policies designed to minimize the social and economic costs of a catastrophic disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radosavijevic, V.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/852d2b99ad54cc954990a5684e6f57ba04169545.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152164.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444522726003731; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444522726003731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bioterrorism - biological attack","agroterrorist attack","deliberate attack","organism level","disease detection","disease introduction","auto-bioterrorism","farm level","national level","agricultural sector level","technical requirements of agroterrorism","catastrophic disease outbreak","plant disease resistance","perpetrators","major determinants of biological warfare","bioterrorism-related diseases","human-targeted bioterrorism","wide range of motives","multidimensional threat","climate changes","Environmental changes","wide range of actions","livestock population","profit motive","modified organism","Technical barriers","permanent impact","agricultural intensification","Terrorists\u0027 motives","endangered species population","strategic wartime programs","single act of sabotage","effects","comparison","commercial crops","disastrous spill","facility management techniques","susceptible wildlife","anti-GMO","war types","economic costs","animal","agents","motivations","forestation","urbanization","water projects","mediums","humans","response procedures","delivery","policies","transmission","components","targets","levels"],"language":"en"},

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with the phylogeny analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of human engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Othman, Houcemeddine; Bouslama, Zied; Brandenburg, Jean-Tristan; da Rocha, Jorge; Hamdi, Yosr; Ghedira, Kais; Abid, Najet-Srairi; Hazelhurst, Scott","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/807cc20de41c4d6fb5c6fcf5296e58135ba94a6b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6726b273f345838661eaa39e8adb5df4e1815a9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Receptor Binding Domain"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","viral RBD of SARS","spike protein RBD","host ACE2 protein","Protein-protein binding assays","interaction surface of ACE2","progenitor form of SARS","binding energy","interface residues","host cell","P499 amino acid residues of SARS","viral spike Receptor Binding Domain","interface segment","cell receptor","phylogeny analysis","COVID","outbreak","different variants","complex formation","structural analysis","different coronavirus isolates","complex evolutionary process","current virus responsible","result of human engineering","affinity","genome","Angiotensin","relevance of Q493","valuable source of data","details","mutation accumulation","insight","opinion","putative jump","stability","hACE2","present work","impact","enzyme","publishing","spread","identification"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analysis and BLAST homology search in GenBank data base indicate that two of the farms were infected with the 4/91 strain, one with an unidentified IBV and five were infected with Sul/01/09. The birds in the latter five farms were suffering from nephropathogenic lesions, however, the virus was isolated from kidney but not from trachea in these cases. The birds were vaccinated regularly with 4/91 or MA5 vaccine. The deduced amino acid sequence of the isolated and amplified S1 subunit (372 aa) of Sul/01/09 was differed in 27\u201328% from that of all three vaccine strains (4/91, MA5, and H120) used in the region. This dissimilarity is most likely the cause of poor efficacy of vaccines used in the region, at least in five of these farms. Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis with other published IBV genotypes indicate that this newly isolated virus together with other regionally related and recently published isolates from Israel (IS/720/99, IS/885) and Egypt (egypt/Benisuef/01) belong to a new genotype.

One Health is advocated through an intersectoral coordination to combat zoonoses, and the term has evolved over centuries. The primary aim of this literature review was to examine the change in the definition of the term One Health over time, particuarly following the the introduction of the latest definition in 2007 by the American Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association. METHODS: This review was conducted in four phases. The first phase consisted of a general PubMed search for the phrase \u201COne Health\u201D for every literature published up to December 2014. Then an advanced search was carried out using \u201COne Health\u201D in conjunction with the terms \u201Czoonosis\u201D and \u201Czoonoses\u201D in PubMed for the time period between January 2007 and December 2014. The articles found were then categorized based on the type of journals in which the articles were published. For the second phase, \u201COne Health\u201D was searched as a Medical subject heading (MeSH) term, which is the National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles. In the third phase, One Health advocate organizations were found using Google search engine. During the final phase, One Health was searched in Google scholar, examined by Google trends, and analyzed by Google ngram. RESULTS: Before 2007, One Health had many connotations to health in the medical literature with an incomplete adherence to the usage of One Health linking zoonoses. The Google trends analysis shows an overal steady increase of the search of One Health from 2007 to 2014, which is consistent with the findings of articles from Pubmed. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that the linkage between the terms One Health and zoonoses started in 2007, which correlates with the joint declaration made by the American Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2007. We suggest creating a MeSH term for One Health in the PubMed database to support more specific research on zoonoses, and exploring the possibility of a patent of the term One Health to support global health and evidence based public health.","publish_time":"2015-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asokan, Govindaraj V.","journal":"Cent Asian J Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f703b510de361a759c9fe3419fa3aeb092c95512.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5661195.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5195/cajgh.2015.139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","American Medical Association","American Veterinary Medical Association"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["global health","public health","environmental health","Health advocate organizations","zoonoses","American Medical Association","medical literature","American Veterinary Medical Association","MeSH term","Google search engine","Google scholar","Google ngram","general PubMed search","Medical subject heading","Google trends analysis","PubMed database","literature review","advanced search","indexing articles","findings of articles","final phase","terms","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","Nipah virus","Hendra virus","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","latest definition","time period","influenza viruses","SARS","vocabulary thesaurus","MERS","human","overal steady increase","National Library of Medicine","coronavirus","animal","evidence","inclusive collaboration","incomplete adherence","initiative","specific research","usage","change","phrase","connotations","joint declaration","Zoonotic disease outbreaks","primary aim","zoonosis","conjunction","possibility","linkage","intersectoral coordination","patent","ebola","type of journals","DISCUSSION","METHODS","phases","centuries","decades"],"language":"en"},

This notion is supported by preclinical animal models, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as approved disease modifying therapies (DMTs) that suppress clinical relapse and are designed to impede infiltration of activated lymphocytes into the CNS. Nonetheless, emerging evidence demonstrates that the innate immune response e.g., neutrophils can amplify white matter damage through a variety of different mechanisms. Indeed, using a model of coronavirus-induced neurologic disease, we have demonstrated that sustained neutrophil infiltration into the CNS of infected animals correlates with increased demyelination.

Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal coliform. The results showed that spatial differences were mainly dominated by urbanization level, and environmental factors could explain the temporal dynamics of fecal coliform in different urban patterns except in areas with high urbanization levels. Reducing suspended solids is a direct way to manage fecal coliform in the Beiyun River when the natural factors are difficulty to change, such as temperature and solar radiation. The export of fecal coliform from urban areas showed a quick and sensitive response to rainfall events and increased dozens of times in the short term. Landscape patterns, such as the fragmentation of impervious surfaces and the overall landscape, were identified as key factors influencing urban non-point source bacteria.

The RT-LAMP assay of CSFV showed higher sensitivities than that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 5 copies per reaction. No cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including porcine circovirus type 2, porcine parvovirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.

Asymptomatic patients may also have lung lesions on imaging. CT investigation in patients with suspicion Covid-19 pneumonia involves the use of the high-resolution technique (HRCT). Artificial intelligence (AI) software has been employed to facilitate CT diagnosis. AI software must be useful categorizing the disease into different severities, integrating the structured report, prepared according to subjective considerations, with quantitative, objective assessments of the extent of the lesions. In this communication, we present an example of a good tool for the radiologist (Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, Italy) in Covid-19 diagnosis (Pan et al. in Radiology, 2020. 10.1148/radiol.2020200370). Thoracic VCAR offers quantitative measurements of the lung involvement. Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians. In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma. AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas. Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belfiore, Maria Paola; Urraro, Fabrizio; Grassi, Roberta; Giacobbe, Giuliana; Patelli, Gianluigi; Cappabianca, Salvatore; Reginelli, Alfonso","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec9e8e7ee336d054bbedcb1b89dc689809088b10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367319/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01195-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","GE Healthcare","VCAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AI software","Thoracic VCAR software","lung lesions","CT diagnosis","suspicion Covid","CT investigation","percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma","lung involvement","concise report","objective evaluations","structured report","objective assessments","quantitative measurements","Asymptomatic patients","healthy parenchyma","GE Healthcare","spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","thanks","radiologist","Italy","vital medical information","different severities","use","pneumonia","subjective considerations","high diagnostic sensitivity","colorimetric map","good tool","ground glass","infectious viral diseases","SARS-CoV","computed tomography","mind","help","post-processing phase","extent","high-resolution technique","chest X-ray","countries","example","HRCT","physicians","consolidation","respect","Artificial intelligence","global response","health systems","pandemic proportions","Radiology","imaging","volume","areas","weeks","communication"],"language":"en"},

A person of average weight has approximately 5quarts of blood containing more than 20 trillion individual cells. The discovery of blood groups by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 enabled the safe transfusion of blood, and transfusion therapy came into widespread use after World War II. However, it was soon recognized that donor blood could transmit infectious agents, and this was more likely to occur if the person giving the blood was motivated by a monetary reward. The frequency of transfusion-transmitted disease has been greatly reduced since 1985, when the Red Cross, other blood collectors, and the Food and Drug Administration began to rigorously screen donors and extensively test the donated blood. The chapter concludes by describing several recent advances that have further improved transfusion safety.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, David","journal":"Linked by Blood: Hemophilia and AIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d77374445d46bebcf84b36e608304035e7a4320.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148635.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128053027000033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128053027000033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Karl Landsteiner"],"organizations":["US","Red Cross","Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood collectors","quarts of blood","donor blood","role of blood","donated blood","safe transfusion of blood","discovery of blood groups","US blood supply","transfusion therapy","frequency of transfusion","improved transfusion safety","chapter","person of average weight","transmission of viruses","Karl Landsteiner","recounts early efforts","widespread use","recent advances","donors","Food","Drug Administration","World War","infectious agents","transmitted disease","Red Cross","monetary reward","individual cells"],"language":"en"},

The transcriptome induced by IFN-\u03B12b in the patient\u2019s cells is much narrower than that of control cells; however, induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated gene transcripts remains detectable. In vitro, the patient\u2019s cells do not control three respiratory viruses, influenza A virus (IAV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These phenotypes are rescued by wild-type IRF9, whereas silencing IRF9 expression in control cells increases viral replication. However, the child has controlled various common viruses in vivo, including respiratory viruses other than IAV.

The aim of this prospective birth cohort study was to identify risk factors for an hMPV or RSV infection during the first year of life in unselected healthy children. We followed 217 children from birth to 1 year of age. Nasal swabs and symptom diaries were collected monthly. Anti-hMPV and anti-RSV IgG antibodies by age 1 year were detected by ELISA, and nasal swabs were analysed for hMPV and RSV by RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis. Anti-hMPV IgG was found in 38 children (17.5%), and anti-RSV IgG in 172 children (79%). Risk factors for being anti-hMPV IgG-positive were: (1) being born in the spring (OR = 2.36; 95% CI:1.06\u20135.27), and (2) having older siblings (OR = 3.82; 95% CI:1.75\u20138.34). Risk factors for being anti-RSV IgG-positive were: (1) gestational age \u003C38 weeks (OR = 3.39; 95% CI:1.42\u20138.05), (2) increasing paternal age (OR = 1.85 per 5 yrs; 95% CI:1.28\u20132.68), and (3) wall-to-wall carpeting (OR = 3.15; 95% CI:1.29\u20137.68). Being born in the spring was associated with decreased odds of being anti-RSV IgG-positive (OR = 0.27, 95% CI:0.09\u20130.85). Risk factors for RSV hospitalisation (n = 11) were: (1) older siblings (OR = 4.49; 95% CI: 1.08\u201318.73) and (2) smoking in the household (OR = 5.06; 95% CI: 1.36\u201318.76).

It is used to help prevent influenza infection as long as necessary with little risk for influenza mutation rendering it less effective. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability, and to determine bioequivalence, of a newly developed generic dispersible tablet formulation (test) and a branded capsule formulation (reference) of arbidol 200 mg in healthy Chinese fasted male volunteers. Methods: This open-label, single-dose, randomized-sequence, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy native Chinese male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 200-mg dose of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 1-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. The study drugs were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. After the study drug administration, serial blood samples were collected for 72 hours after administration. Plasma drug concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Several pharmacokinetic pararameters, including Cmax, Tmax, t\u00BD, AUC0-t, and AUC0-\u221E, were determined from the plasma concentrations of the 2 formulations of arbidol using noncom-partmental analysis. The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the log-transformed ratios of Cmax and AUC were within the predetermined bioequivalence range of 80% to 125% established by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People\u0027s Republic of China. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and electrocardiography), laboratory analysis (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis), and subject interview on adverse events. Results: Twenty subjects were enrolled and completed the study (mean [SD] age, 21.1 [1.1] years; weight, 64.7 [5.1] kg; and height, 172.3 [3.1] cm). Neither period nor sequence effect was observed. The main pharmacokinetic properties with the test and reference formulations were as follows: Cmax, 417.4 (107.6) and 414.8 (95.1) ng/mL, respectively (P = NS); median (range) Tmax, 0.63 (0.25\u20131.0) and 0.75 (0.5\u20131.5) hours (P = 0.035); AUC0-t, 2033.6 (564.9) and 1992.0 (483.3) ng/mL/h (P = NS); AUC0-\u221E, 2285.4 (597.7) and 2215.2 (604.0) ng/mL/h (P = NS); and t1/2, 6.9 (4.2) and 6.1 (5.2) hours (P = NS). The 90% CIs for the log-transformed ratios of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-\u221E were 91.7% to 109.7%, 91.0% to 112.8%, and 92.0% to 116.3%, respectively (all, P \u003C 0.05), which were within the predetermined range for bioequivalence. No adverse events were found on analysis of vital signs or laboratory tests or reported by subjects in this study.

Herein, PEDV isolate 85-7 could proliferate and induce cell\u2013cell fusion in a trypsin independent manner on Vero cells, and eight homologous mutation strains were screened by continuous proliferation in the absence of trypsin on Vero cells. According to the whole genome sequence comparative analysis, we identified four major variations located in nonstructural protein 2, S, open reading frame 3, and envelope (E) genes, respectively. Comparative analyses of their genomic variations and proliferation characteristics identified a single mutation within the S2\u2032 cleavage site between C30 and C40 mutants: the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) (R895G). This change resulted in weaker cell\u2013cell fusion, smaller plaque morphology, higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation. Further analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal cell-adaptation, but not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. Otherwise, a novel variation (16\u201320 aa deletion and an L25P mutation) in the transmembrane domain of the E protein affected multiple infection processes, including up-regulation of the production of the ER stress indicator GRP78, improving the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and promoting apoptosis. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of viral functional proteins in PEDV replication, infection, and fitness.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize molecular epidemiology of HRV and association between HRV species and clinical presentation and viral shedding. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, prospective, facility-based study of ILI was conducted from February 2010 to April 2012. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens, patient symptoms, and clinical information occurred on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Patients recorded symptom severity daily for the first 7 days of illness in a symptom diary. HRV was identified by RT-PCR and genotyped for species determination. Cases who were co-infected with other viral respiratory pathogens were excluded from the analysis. We evaluated the associations between HRV species, clinical severity, and patterns of viral shedding. RESULTS: Eighty-four HRV cases were identified and their isolates genotyped. Of these, 62 (74%) were \u003E18y. Fifty-four were HRV-A, 11 HRV-B, and 19 HRV-C. HRV-C infection was more common among children than adults (59% vs. 10%, P\u003C0.001). Among adults, HRV-A was associated with higher severity of upper respiratory symptoms compared to HRV-B (P=0.02), but no such association was found in children. In addition, adults shed HRV-A significantly longer than HRV-C (Ptrend=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among otherwise healthy adults with HRV infection, we observed species-specific differences in respiratory symptom severity and duration of viral shedding.","publish_time":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei-Ju; Arnold, John C.; Fairchok, Mary P.; Danaher, Patrick J.; McDonough, Erin A.; Blair, Patrick J.; Garcia, Josefina; Halsey, Eric S.; Schofield, Christina; Ottolini, Martin; Mor, Deepika; Ridor\u00E9, Michelande; Burgess, Timothy H.; Millar, Eugene V.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05799a7a16240bfe444ade79311c410f9f8686aa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/51667c85b8b8170c950a1b561b3f2245c3cdce25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4347877.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215000190; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.01.007; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4347877?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25728083/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215000190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV species","HRV-B","HRV cases","HRV-C infection","molecular epidemiology of HRV","virologic characteristics of HRV infection","clinical severity","healthy adults","respiratory symptom severity","disease severity","children","viral respiratory pathogens","duration of viral shedding","patterns of viral shedding","clinical presentation","clinical information","species determination","days of illness","higher severity of upper respiratory symptoms","symptom diary","underlying illness","patient symptoms","species-specific differences","facility-based study of ILI","healthy populations","STUDY DESIGN","hospitalized patients","Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens","major cause of influenza","associations","Human rhinovirus","RT-PCR","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","analysis","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","isolates","Ptrend","addition"],"language":"en"},

It is noted, however, that the N protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with nucleocapsid proteins of other members of the coronavirus family [Science 300 (2003) 1399; Science 300 (2003) 1394]. N proteins of other coronavirus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral RNA. As data generated from some viral systems other than coronaviruses suggested that viral N\u2013N self-interactions may be necessary for subsequent formation of the nucleocapsid and assembly of the viral particles, we decided to investigate SARS-CoV N\u2013N interaction. By using mammalian two-hybrid system and sucrose gradient fractionations, a homotypic interaction of N, but not M, was detected by the two-hybrid analysis. The mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed an approximately 50-fold increase in SEAP activity (measurement of protein\u2013protein interaction) in N\u2013N interaction compared to that observed in either M\u2013M or mock transfection. Furthermore, mutational analyses characterized that a serine/arginine-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization, since deletion of this region completely abolished the N protein self-multimerization. Finally, the full-length nucleocapsid protein expressed and purified from baculovirus system was found to form different levels of higher order structures as detected by Western blot analysis of the fractionated proteins. Collectively, these results may aid us in elucidating the mechanism pertaining to formation of viral nucleocapsid core, and designing molecular approaches to intervene SARS-CoV replication.","publish_time":"2004-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Runtao; Dobie, Frederick; Ballantine, Melissa; Leeson, Andrew; Li, Yan; Bastien, Nathalie; Cutts, Todd; Andonov, Anton; Cao, Jingxin; Booth, Timothy F.; Plummer, Frank A.; Tyler, Shaun; Baker, Lindsay; Li, Xuguang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c03933a114eec80322df43ecc12c981800a0fe3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111152.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04003250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04003250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS Coronavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein of SARS","SARS-CoV N","N proteins","N protein oligomerization","homotypic interaction of N","N protein self-multimerization","protein interaction","N self-interactions","SARS-CoV replication","full-length nucleocapsid protein","measurement of protein","nucleocapsid proteins","genome of SARS Coronavirus","viral core","formation of viral nucleocapsid core","viral systems","viral particles","viral RNA","hybrid system","hybrid analysis","coronavirus family","novel coronavirus","fractionated proteins","hybrid assay","mammalian","Science","subsequent formation","baculovirus system","Western blot analysis","sucrose gradient fractionations","different levels of higher order structures","members","molecular approaches","little homology","arginine-rich motif","SEAP activity","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","serine","SSRSSSRSRGNSR","assembly","packaging","region","coronaviruses","amino acids","fold increase","emerging disease","deletion","atypical pneumonia","transcription","mechanism","mutational analyses","data","number of genes","mock transfection","results"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies indicated that supplemental lactoferrin may alter the microbial populations in the gut of nonruminants and increase preweaning weight gains in calves. In the present study, 40 Holstein calves were used to examine the effects of supplemental lactoferrin (0, 1, 2, or 3 g/d) on health, growth, and feed intake from 3 d of age to 2 wk postweaning. Lactoferrin was mixed and fed with a nonmedicated milk replacer. Calves were housed in individual pens and offered a textured, nonmedicated starter and water for ad libitum consumption. Body weight and heart girth were measured weekly. Intakes of milk replacer and starter were determined daily. Fecal consistency was monitored three times per week. Calves were weaned when they met certain criteria based on body weight gain and starter intake. Preweaning fecal score responded quadratically, with the group fed 1 g/d of lactoferrin having the lowest score. Overall and preweaning number of days medicated responded in the same manner as fecal score. Preweaning average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio increased linearly with lactoferrin supplementation, whereas postweaning gain-to-feed ratio decreased linearly with lactoferrin. Overall average daily heart girth gain increased linearly with lactoferrin. Body weight, weaning age, and dry matter intake were not different among treatments. Based on the observed improved gain-to-feed ratios, increased average daily gains, improved fecal scores, and reduced morbidity in preweaned calves, it appears that lactoferrin may be a beneficial supplement in the diets of neonatal calves prior to weaning.","publish_time":"2003-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robblee, E.

Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity? Connectivity in the wild should be maintained via prevention of habitat loss, while management of small isolated populations may require reestablishing gene flow.

This motif is a generalized feature of viral fusion proteins and has been exploited in generating antiviral fusion agents. In the present paper, we report structural characters of Env protein from another lentivirus, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), which contributes to a good animal model of HIV. BIV HR1 and HR2 regions are predicted by two different programs and expressed separately or conjointly in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and biophysical analyses show that the predicted HRs of BIV Env can form a stable trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle just like that formed by feline immunodeficiency virus Env.

Up to now, a wide range of harmful proteins have been discovered in different plants, including lectins, ribosome-inactivating proteins, protease inhibitors, ureases, arcelins, antimicrobial peptides and pore-forming toxins. To fulfill their role in plant defense, these proteins exhibit various degrees of toxicity towards animals, insects, bacteria or fungi. Numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the toxic effects and mode of action of these plant proteins in order to explore their possible applications. Indeed, because of their biological activities, toxic plant proteins are also considered as potentially useful tools in crop protection and in biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment. Genes encoding toxic plant proteins have been introduced into crop genomes using genetic engineering technology in order to increase the plant\u2019s resistance against pathogens and diseases. Despite the availability of ample information on toxic plant proteins, very few publications have attempted to summarize the research progress made during the last decades. This review focuses on the diversity of toxic plant proteins in view of their toxicity as well as their mode of action.

These procedures can be challenging when the subject is a wild canid, particularly in a field setting. In addition, reproductive hormone assays are unreliable as a diagnostic tool because the estrous profiles of pregnant and pseudopregnant canines are similar. However, research has demonstrated that the hormone relaxin can be detected in maternal blood after embryonic implantation, but remains negligible in non-pregnant females. We investigated the use of relaxin as a diagnostic marker of pregnancy in the coyote (C. latrans). A commercially available canine relaxin enzyme immunoassay (ReproCHEK\u2122) was used to test plasma collected from 124 female coyotes over four consecutive breeding seasons. Mating activities of the captive females were observed; then peripheral blood samples were collected at intervals throughout pregnancy, as well as after parturition. Results demonstrated that relaxin could be detected in the plasma of pregnant coyotes after 28 days of gestation, and in some cases as early as 23 days, while non-pregnant females and male coyotes consistently tested negative. Relaxin also remained detectable in the plasma of the majority of females tested 10\u201312 weeks after parturition.

We demonstrated the systematic mechanism of functional ingredients in barley to combat chronic diseases, based on PubMed, CNKI, and ISI Web of Science databases from 2004 to 2020. Barley and its extracts are rich in 30 ingredients to combat more than 20 chronic diseases, which include the 14 similar and 9 different chronic diseases between grains and grass, due to the major molecular mechanism of six functional ingredients of barley grass (GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K-Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan) and grains (\u03B2-glucans, polyphenols, arabinoxylan, phytosterols, tocols, and resistant starch). The antioxidant activity of barley grass and grain has the same and different functional components. These results support findings that barley grain and its grass are the best functional food, promoting ancient Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations, and further show the depending functional ingredients for diet from Pliocene hominids in Africa and Neanderthals in Europe to modern humans in the world.

Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO(2)/FiO(2) (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO(2)/FiO(2) of \u003C 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature. RESULTS: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choudhury, Rashikh; Barrett, Christopher D.; Moore, Hunter B.; Moore, Ernest E.; McIntyre, Robert C.; Moore, Peter K.; Talmor, Daniel S.; Nydam, Trevor L.; Yaffe, Michael B.","journal":"World J Emerg Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fc88c41e39fc070e225580762354bdb7a155e03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169373.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13017-020-00305-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["salvage use tPA","Salvage use of tPA","ill patients","extent tPA","recovery of ARDS patients","ill COVID","base case patients","existing ARDS","projected COVID","mild ARDS","diagnosis of ARDS","current US COVID","salvage use criteria","reduced mortality","USA","peak mortality","related mortality","pandemic","mmHg","FiO","Markov model parameters","optimal social distancing","decision analytic Markov state transition model","refractory PaO","existing critical care infrastructure","population-based survival","acute respiratory distress syndrome","METHODS","sufficient resources","Systemic tissue plasminogen activator","deaths","life","standard therapy","literature","CONCLUSIONS","tTPA","patient groups","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","scenarios"],"language":"en"},

Clinical pictures of different viral causes are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to establish the differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics between the different viral causes of lower respiratory tract infections in preschool children. METHODS: We included 278 preschool children hospitalized because of lower respiratory tract infection. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein values were determined and chest X-ray was performed in most patients. Polymerase chain reaction assay was used for the detection of viral pathogens from nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Pneumonia was present in 71.4 % of all coronavirus infections, 35.1 % of all respiratory syncytial virus infections, and 13.0 % of all rhinovirus infections. Coronavirus (p = 0.03) and respiratory syncytial virus (p \u003C 0.01) were retrospectively shown to be associated with the presence of pneumonia and rhinovirus (p \u003C 0.01) with the absence of pneumonia. Wheezing was present in 81.5 % of all rhinovirus infections and in only 33.3 % of all adenovirus infections. Rhinovirus (p \u003C 0.01) was associated with the presence of wheezing and adenovirus (p = 0.05) with the absence of wheezing. In adenovirus infections mean C-reactive protein value was 72.4 mg/L and white blood cell count 19.000/\u00B5l, both significantly higher than in other viruses (p \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and laboratory characteristics of viral lower respiratory tract infections significantly differ. With the advance of viral detection methods and increase of knowledge it becomes possible to characterize different respiratory viral infections and to improve the differential diagnosis.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berce, Vojko; Unuk, Sibila; Duh, Darja; Hom\u0161ak, Matja\u017E; Vi\u010Di\u010D, Maja","journal":"Wien Klin Wochenschr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d24b9ee5f6da8aad4daaa035c86598c1f29c19d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-015-0843-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26373742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rhinovirus infections","different respiratory viral infections","adenovirus infections","coronavirus infections","different viral causes of lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus infections","laboratory characteristics of viral lower respiratory tract infections","detection of viral pathogens","Clinical pictures of different viral causes","preschool children","advance of viral detection methods","presence of pneumonia","presence of wheezing","absence of pneumonia","absence of wheezing","White blood cell count","C-reactive protein values","leading cause of hospitalizations","\u00B5l","knowledge","BACKGROUND","chest X-ray","nasopharyngeal swab","differences","Polymerase chain reaction assay","CONCLUSIONS","differential diagnosis","study","patients","viruses","RESULTS","aim"],"language":"en"},

The framework identified key factors of influenza vaccination and presented the inter-relation of behaviour-related variables. However, further well-designed studies are required to explore the inter-relationships accurately and comprehensively.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kan, T.; Zhang, J.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6739c28085b8fbb42bd1ad24108df30c37328357.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111770.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350617304092; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2017.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408191/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350617304092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Observational Studies","HBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["behaviour-related factors","key factors of influenza vaccination","health behaviour","influenza vaccination behaviour of elderly people","health promotion factors","past behaviour","HBM","selected studies","inter-relation of behaviour","shared understanding of factors","Possible determinants of influenza vaccination","new framework","Key information","well-designed studies","Articles","Study design Systematic review","Health Belief Model","Reporting of Observational Studies","related variables","study quality","inter-relationships","recommendations","subjective norms","behavioural beliefs","STROBE","knowledge","threat perception","Critical Appraisal Skills Programme","Epidemiology","CASP","checklist","perceived barriers","Theory of Reasoned Action","constructs","databases","inclusion","predesigned sheet","predetermined strategies","Abstract Objectives","exclusion criteria","Methods","authors","Conclusions","concepts","Results","citations"],"language":"en"},

Meta-analysis of findings from genome-wide RNAi screens has shown influenza virus to be dependent on functional nodes in host cell pathways, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular proteins for replication. Because rapid evolution of the influenza A viruses persistently complicates the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics, a further understanding of the complex host cell pathways coopted by influenza virus for replication may provide new targets and strategies for antiviral therapy.

We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 25\u00B0C. Methods Influenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. Results After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 29\u00B0C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log10 reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. Conclusions Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection.

Here, we demonstrate by metabolic labeling with [3H]-palmitic acid that the S protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus, is palmitoylated as well. This is relevant for TGEV replication as virus growth was compromised by the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate. Mutation of individual cysteine clusters in the cysteine-rich motif of S revealed that all cysteines must be replaced to abolish acylation and incorporation of S into virus-like particles (VLP).

In addition, the anti-influenza A virus activity of PPa was further assessed in mice infected with the influenza A virus.

To meet these requirements, vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of (i) the protective roles of antiviral B and T-cell-mediated immune responses, (ii) the complexity and plasticity of major viral antigens, and (iii) virus molecular biology and pathogenesis. There are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines, whole-inactivated virus, vectored, and live-attenuated virus vaccines, each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations. While nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable, they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines. In most cases, the latter induce long-lasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination. The chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, focusing on two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans. The development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that, for example, interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes, thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enjuanes, L.; Zu\u00F1iga, S.; Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, C.; Gutierrez-Alvarez, J.; Canton, J.; Sola, I.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/008cf2148ee4383534191b3736096878cad82c67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112271.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352716300422; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352716300422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712626/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nonliving virus vaccines","Abstract Virus vaccines","types of vaccines","live-attenuated virus vaccines","development of attenuated virus vaccines","subunit vaccines","inactivated virus","virus molecular biology","SARS-CoV","viral pathogenesis","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","T-cell","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","immune responses","specific cell types","specific advantages","long-lasting immunity","vaccination","effects","antiviral host responses","T lymphocytes","characterization of viral virulence proteins","zoonotic CoVs","plasticity of major viral antigens","clear advantages","development of coronavirus","pathogenic CoVs","adaptive immune response","protective roles of antiviral B","reversion","macrophages","epithelial cells","identification","complexity","interactions","infections","special safety measures","recent progress","example","vaccine studies","deadly disease","virulent viruses","epidemics","humans","comprehensive understanding","requirements","chapter","cases","limitations"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, eEF1A2 protein favors oncogenesis as shown by the fact that overexpression of eEF1A2 leads to cellular transformation and gives rise to tumors in nude mice. The eEF1A2 protein stimulates the phospholipid signaling and activates the Akt-dependent cell migration and actin remodeling that ultimately favors tumorigenesis.

Finally, eEF1A proteins interact with several viral proteins resulting in enhanced viral replication, decreased apoptosis, and increased cellular transformation.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%\u2013~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu; Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a300201a125aadde1b25526dcc1d69cbdf6dfb0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e29c64bd0f2939278d021ccc9103aed342c72d5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128585.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289090/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020305922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020305922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases of COVID","effect of confirmed cases","recovery cases","suspected cases","transmission of COVID","increased levels of confirmed cases","novel coronavirus attributable deaths","novel coronavirus disease","human transmission","China","novel estimation approaches","unobserved factors","nexus","presence of unobserved heterogeneity","Provinces","health indicators","States","spread","study","public health emergency","World Health Organization","common factors","daily data","nonlinear relationship","empirical results","empirical evidence","panel data models","estimation methods capable","cross-sectional dependence","outbreak","conceptual tools","environmental exposures accounting","local hospital","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","time series","preventive measures","endogeneity","initial investigation","global debate","impulse-response","safety precaution","pneumonia","medium","assessment","unknown cause","role","countries","complexities","CI"],"language":"en"},

Data on the epidemiology profiles of ARIs are scarce in the western and rural areas of China. The purpose of the current study is to provide data on the presence of potential pathogens of ARIs in hospitalized children in Chengdu, west China. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from hospitalized patients (under 6 years old) with ARIs in a local hospital in Chengdu. Eight respiratory viruses were identified by PCR and 6 respiratory bacteria by biochemical reactions and Analytical Profile Index (API). Pathogens profiles, clinical characteristics and seasonality were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients were identified with at least one respiratory pathogen. Human rhinovirus (HRV) (23%), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.7%) was the most commonly identified viruses, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%) the most commonly identified bacterium in the study. The presences of more than one pathogen were found, and multiple viral, bacterial, viral/bacterial combinations were identified in 14.9, 3.3 and 13.9% of patients respectively. Respiratory viruses were identified throughout the year with a seasonal peak in December\u2013February. Pathogens profiles and clinical associations were different between infants (\u003C 1 year of age) and older children (\u003E 1 year of age). Infants with ARIs were more likely to have one or more viruses than older children. Infants identified with multiple pathogens had significantly higher proportions of tachypnea than infants that were not. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that viral agents were frequently found in hospitalized children with ARI in Chengdu during the study period. This study gives us better information on the pathogen profiles, clinical associations, co-infection combinations and seasonal features of ARIs in hospitalized children, which is important for diagnoses and treatment of ARIs, as well as implementation of vaccines in this area. Moreover, future efforts in reducing the impact of ARIs will depend on programs in which available vaccines, especially vaccines on RSV, HRV and S. pneumoniae could be employed in this region and new vaccines could be developed against common pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jiayi; Hu, Pengwei; Zhou, Tao; Zheng, Tianli; Zhou, Lingxu; Jiang, Chunping; Pei, Xiaofang","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87e2c4caa0401de97f31022abe3d31b9313978e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6034247.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1203-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Chengdu"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","identified viruses","respiratory pathogen","hospitalized children","Pathogens profiles","epidemiology profiles of ARIs","impact of ARIs","hospitalized patients","treatment of ARIs","respiratory bacteria","Respiratory specimens","infants","identified bacterium","presence of potential pathogens of ARIs","older children","pathogen profiles","multiple pathogens","seasonal features of ARIs","Acute respiratory infection","Chengdu","common pathogens","Respiratory syncytial virus","current study","study period","clinical associations","pediatric patients","available vaccines","year of age","new vaccines","implementation of vaccines","percent of patients","clinical characteristics","bacterial combinations","viral agents","RSV","Data","HRV","co-infection combinations","seasonal peak","west China","Klebsiella pneumoniae","rural areas of China","biochemical reactions","Analytical Profile Index","intense pressure","leading cause of morbidity","mortality","PCR","higher proportions of tachypnea","years old","better information","health care facilities","API","programs","BACKGROUND","diagnoses","seasonality","local hospital","region","future efforts","Human rhinovirus","RESULTS","purpose","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","presences"],"language":"en"},

By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.

Infected pigs would consume more feed and require protracted production time to reach market weight. In our observational longitudinal study, growth performance data from 728 control pigs and 193 infected pigs with known viral shedding time points were analyzed using mixed linear regression models to give estimates of the marginal effects of infection. Gaussian curves describing the variability of the estimates at the individual pig level formed the fundamental inputs to our stochastic models. The models were constructed to simulate the summed negative effects of the infection at the batch level of 150 fattening pigs growing from 33 to 100 kg. Other inputs of variability and uncertainty were 1) batch transmission points, 2) pig infection points to reflect the disease transmission dynamics of the virus, and 3) final prevalence of infected pigs in the batch. Monte Carlo random sampling gave 5,000 estimates on the outputs of the marginal effects for each pig. These results were summed up to provide estimates for a batch size of 150 pigs. This figure was adjusted by our final prevalence distribution function, which was also derived from the longitudinal study with 12 cohorts of infected pigs. For a 150-fattening-pig herd randomly selected from the population, the marginal effects of the infection were 1) 835 kg (fifth percentile) to 1,350 kg (95th percentile) increased feed intake and 2) 194 (fifth percentile) to 334 (95th percentile) pig days in excess of expected figures for an uninfected batch. A batch infected during growth phase 3 (81 to 100 kg BW) gave the worst results since the longitudinal study showed that a pig infected during growth phase 3 required more feed and a greater protracted production time compared to younger infected pigs. Sensitivity analysis showed that final prevalence had the greatest impact on the conditional mean and variation of the marginal effects of infections. Batch transmission point was the next most influential factor. Lowering the final prevalence and preventing older fattening pigs from being infected will have the greatest benefit in saving feed cost and reducing delay in getting the pigs to the market.","publish_time":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Er, Chiek; Skjerve, Eystein; Brun, Edgar; Hofmo, Peer Ola; Framstad, Tore; Lium, Bj\u00F8rn","journal":"J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba255a58e5e1ab31d730576978a402b86b8c097a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109966.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2015-9251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27065145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["final prevalence of infected pigs","younger infected pigs","cohorts of infected pigs","control pigs","Norwegian pigs","older fattening pigs","pig infection points","batch level","batch transmission points","estimates","uninfected batch","batch size","percentile","feed efficiency","feed cost","feed intake","pig days","fattening-pig herd","marginal effects of infections","individual pig level","growth phase","pdm09 virus infection","summed negative effects","final prevalence distribution function","growth performance data","pig\u0027s growth performance","observational longitudinal study","poorer feed conversion ratio","greater protracted production time","inputs of variability","stochastic models","known viral shedding time points","disease transmission dynamics","greatest impact","fundamental inputs","mixed linear regression models","greatest benefit","worst results","market weight","terms","H1N1","variation","excess of expected figures","conditional mean","uncertainty","Monte Carlo random sampling","outputs","population","emerged influenza","Sensitivity analysis","delay","influential factor","subclinical form","Gaussian curves","BW"],"language":"en"},

We investigate whether this protein is also involved in the HCV RNA replication.

Knock-down of SYNCRIP by siRNA significantly decreased the amount of HCV RNA in the cells containing a subgenomic replicon or a full-length viral RNA.

In Alaska enzootic rabies persist in northern and western coastal areas. Only sporadic cases have occurred in areas outside of the regions considered enzootic for the virus, such as the interior of the state and urbanized regions. RESULTS: Here we examine the distribution of diagnosed rabies cases in Alaska, explicit in space and time. We use a geographic information system (GIS), 20 environmental data layers and provide a quantitative non-parsimonious estimate of the predicted ecological niche, based on data mining, machine learning and open access data. We identify ecological correlates and possible drivers that determine the ecological niche of rabies virus in Alaska. More specifically, our models show that rabies cases are closely associated with human infrastructure, and reveal an ecological niche in remote northern wilderness areas. Furthermore a model utilizing climate modeling suggests a reduction of the current ecological niche for detection of rabies virus in Alaska, a state that is disproportionately affected by a changing climate. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may help to better inform public health decisions in the future and guide further studies on individual drivers of rabies distribution in the Arctic.

Due to the problems caused by the uncertainty in alignment, existing tools for phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could not be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison and phylogenomic studies of viruses. There has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data. Among the alignment-free methods, a dynamical language (DL) method proposed by our group has successfully been applied to the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and chloroplast genomes. RESULTS: In this paper, the DL method is used to analyze the whole-proteome phylogeny of 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses, two data sets with large difference in genome size. The trees from our analyses are in good agreement to the latest classification of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). CONCLUSIONS: The present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses, and also some insights on the affiliation of a number of unclassified viruses. In comparison, some alignment-free methods such as the CV Tree method can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, but they are not suitable for resolving the phylogeny of parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.","publish_time":"2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Zu-Guo; Chu, Ka Hou; Li, Chi Pang; Anh, Vo; Zhou, Li-Qian; Wang, Roger Wei","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/876ae65a682f1bf2941f54851442532ae722382c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2898692.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565983/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CV Tree"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses","phylogeny of parvoviruses","alignment-free methods","Taxonomy of Viruses","alignment-based analysis of virus phylogeny","latest classification of large dsDNA viruses","multiple alignment","large difference","phylogenomic studies of viruses","number of unclassified viruses","genome comparison","proteome phylogeny","phylogenetic analysis of bacteria","present method","complete genome data","smaller genome size","CV Tree method","data sets","different virus groups","great challenge","vast sequence divergence","International Committee","existing tools","good agreement","new way","dynamical language","uncertainty","affiliation","chloroplast genomes","analyses","BACKGROUND","insights","ICTV","trees","paper","CONCLUSIONS","problems","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Human sufferings seem to be continuing, and it is not clear how long this will continue and how much more destruction it is going to cause until complete control is achieved. One of the most disturbing issues is Covid-19 treatment; although a large number of medications, previously used successfully with other viruses (including Chinese herbal medicines and anti-malaria drugs), are under consideration, there remain questions as to whether they can play a satisfactory role for this disease. Global attempts are ongoing to find the drugs for the treatment of this virus but none of the antiviral drugs used for treatment of other human viral infection is working and hence attempts to find new drugs are continuing.

Factors influenced by climate change and that could affect livestock diseases include the molecular biology of the pathogen itself; vectors (if any); farming practice and land use; zoological and environmental factors; and the establishment of new microenvironments and microclimates. The interaction of these factors is an important consideration in forecasting how livestock diseases may be affected. Risk assessments should focus on looking for combinations of factors that may be directly affected by climate change, or that may be indirectly affected through changes in human activity, such as land use (e.g. deforestation), transport and movement of animals, intensity of livestock farming and habitat change. A risk assessment framework is proposed, based on modules that accommodate these factors. This framework could be used to screen for the emergence of unexpected disease events.","publish_time":"2009-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gale, P.; Drew, T.; Phipps, L.P.; David, G.; Wooldridge, M.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e13515cbeaf50d17c86f28cd964c8aadb495414.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197753.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.04036.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19191974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Great Britain"],"keyphrases":["climate change","prevalence of livestock diseases","habitat change","environmental factors","combinations of factors","intensity of livestock farming","land use","GB","risk assessment framework","farming practice","Risk assessments","important consideration","transport","movement of animals","Great Britain","forecasting","molecular biology","establishment of new microenvironments","human activity","deforestation","distribution","paper reviews","emergence of unexpected disease events","microclimates","pathogen","vectors","occurrence","strong evidence","changes","interaction","modules"],"language":"en"},

Maternal antibodies represent the main shield of neonate mammals for most of the infections. Two recombinant antigens (SA35 and SA40), portions of two C. parvum proteins, were tested for their ability to induce immune responses in adult mice and for protection on neonate BALB/c mice born from females immunised by mucosal delivery of both peptides. METHODS: Adult BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally immunised with SA35 and SA40, separately or mixed, and their immune response was characterised. Furthermore, BALB/c pregnant mice were immunised by mucosal delivery with an SA35/40 mix, before and during pregnancy. Soon after birth, their offspring were infected with two doses (1 \u00D7 10(5) and 5 \u00D7 10(3)) of C. parvum oocysts and the parasitic burden was determined at 5 and 9 days post-infection. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal immunisation with SA35 and SA40 induced specific IgG and IgG1 in serum, specific IgA in the intestinal mucosa, increase of CD3\u002B/CD4\u002B and CD30\u002B cells in splenocytes, which produced IFN-\u03B3. Neonates born from immunised mice and infected with 1 \u00D7 10(5) oocysts showed a significant reduction of oocysts and intestinal forms (23 and 42%, respectively). A reduction of all parasitic forms (96%; P \u003C 0.05) was observed when neonates were infected with 5 \u00D7 10(3) oocysts. CONCLUSIONS: SA35 and SA40 peptides induce specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to C. parvum in adult mice. Moreover, mucosal administration of the SA35/40 mix in pregnant mice reduces C. parvum burden in their litters.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tosini, Fabio; Ludovisi, Alessandra; Tonanzi, Daniele; Amati, Marco; Cherchi, Simona; Pozio, Edoardo; G\u00F3mez-Morales, Maria Angeles","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df3fd6661b2d0bd3a51c54b4cdba7be250e52746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6518611.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3486-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SA35","immunised mice","adult mice","c mice","parvum oocysts","c pregnant mice","parvum burden","Adult BALB","SA40 peptides","Cryptosporidium parvum","parvum proteins","neonate BALB","immune responses","mucosal delivery","significant reduction of oocysts","specific IgG","specific IgA","intestinal forms","mix","mucosal administration","parasitic forms","parasitic burden","Neonates","intestinal mucosa","main shield of neonate mammals","protection","ruminants","children","serum","IgG1","major cause of diarrhea","females","Intraperitoneal immunisation","splenocytes","cells","CD30","ability","portions","earliest stages of life","METHODS","Maternal antibodies","CD4","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","recombinant antigens","CONCLUSIONS","IFN-\u03B3","offspring","days post-infection","infections","litters","birth","doses","pregnancy"],"language":"en"},

The use of xenogeneic protein\u2013free Good Manufacturing Practice\u2013compliant growth media is a prerequisite for clinical MSC isolation and expansion. Human platelet lysate (HPL) has been efficiently implemented into MSC clinical manufacturing as a substitute for fetal bovine serum (FBS). Because the use of human-derived blood materials alleviates immunologic risks but not the transmission of blood-borne viruses, the aim of our study was to test an even safer alternative than HPL to FBS: HPL subjected to pathogen inactivation by psoralen (iHPL). METHODS: Bone marrow samples were plated and expanded in \u03B1-minimum essential medium with 10% of three culture supplements: HPL, iHPL and FBS, at the same time. MSC morphology, growth and immunophenotype were analyzed at each passage. Karyotype, tumorigenicity and sterility were analyzed at the third passage. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The MSCs cultivated in the three different culture conditions showed no significant differences in terms of fibroblast colony-forming unit number, immunophenotype or in their multipotent capacity. Conversely, the HPL/iHPL-MSCs were smaller, more numerous, had a higher proliferative potential and showed a higher Oct-3/4 and NANOG protein expression than did FBS-MSCs. Although HPL/iHPL-MSCs exhibit characteristics that may be attributable to a higher primitive stemness than FBS-MSCs, no tumorigenic mutations or karyotype modifications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that iHPL is safer than HPL and represents a good, Good Manufacturing Practice\u2013compliant alternative to FBS for MSC clinical production that is even more advantageous in terms of cellular growth and stemness.","publish_time":"2014-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castiglia, Sara; Mareschi, Katia; Labanca, Luciana; Lucania, Graziella; Leone, Marco; Sanavio, Fiorella; Castello, Laura; Rustichelli, Deborah; Signorino, Elena; Gunetti, Monica; Bergallo, Massimiliano; Bordiga, Anna Maria; Ferrero, Ivana; Fagioli, Franca","journal":"Cytotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54cd6560a36113227b4e8d9d5ea5a8a4f320b6ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185570.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465324913008402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529555/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1465324913008402","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Karyotype"],"organizations":["MSC","HPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FBS-MSCs","MSC clinical manufacturing","MSC clinical production","clinical MSC isolation","MSC morphology","iHPL-MSCs exhibit characteristics","free Good Manufacturing Practice","compliant alternative","compliant growth media","terms of cellular growth","immunophenotype","safer alternative","higher primitive stemness","use of human","passage","use of xenogeneic protein","higher proliferative potential","transmission of blood","culture supplements","karyotype modifications","terms of fibroblast colony","derived blood materials","different culture conditions","NANOG protein expression","Human platelet lysate","significant differences","prerequisite","substitute","ideal candidates","immunologic risks","Mesenchymal stromal cells","unit number","fetal bovine serum","tumorigenic mutations","pathogen inactivation","BACKGROUND AIMS","immunomodulatory therapies","viruses","expansion","psoralen","\u03B1-minimum essential medium","Bone marrow samples","METHODS","study","sterility","multipotent capacity","tumorigenicity","Statistical analyses","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","time"],"language":"en"},

Contaminated human fingers can transfer the virus to inanimate objects, which may then spread the virus to susceptible persons. However, no information is available on the survival of NoVs on fomites, which may be of importance in the transmission of NoVs in institutional settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. Methods In the absence of any in vitro cultivation system for NoVs, feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as a surrogate. Several fomites such as computer mouse, keyboard keys, telephone wire, telephone receiver, telephone buttons, and brass disks representing faucets and door handle surfaces were artificially contaminated with known amounts of FCV. Samples were taken at regular time intervals, and virus was titrated in feline kidney cells to determine its survival on these surfaces. Results Survivability of FCV varied with fomite type. The virus survived for up to 3 days on telephone buttons and receivers, for 1 or 2 days on computer mouse, and for 8 to 12 hours on keyboard keys and brass. The time for 90% virus reduction was \u003C4 hours on computer keys, mouse, brass, and telephone wire; 4 to 8 hours on telephone receiver; and 12 to 24 hours on telephone buttons. Conclusion The results of this study confirm that FCV (and perhaps NoV) can survive on fomites such as computers, telephones, and faucets and may be transmitted to humans using these contaminated materials. This may necessitate regular cleaning or disinfection of these items, especially in hospitals and nursing homes and after known outbreaks of NoVs.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clay, Stefanie; Maherchandani, Sunil; Malik, Yashpal S.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38690001666b33cdc2249d78254319f1e525456.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119059.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655305005791; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655305005791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Norovirus","FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["telephone buttons","telephone wire","telephone receiver","hours","fomites","computer mouse","computer keys","transmission of NoVs","survival of NoVs","virus reduction","keyboard keys","outbreaks of NoVs","Results Survivability of FCV","known amounts of FCV","brass disks","faucets","hospitals","nursing homes","days","contaminated materials","regular time intervals","Contaminated human fingers","feline calicivirus","regular cleaning","door handle surfaces","feline kidney cells","institutional settings","items","cultivation system","receivers","fomite type","absence","disinfection","Samples","humans","study","computers","telephones","importance","inanimate objects","Background Norovirus","Conclusion","information","susceptible persons","food","Methods","surrogate"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, N gene has long been thought an ideal target for the design of small interference RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a class of small non-coding RNAs with a size of 21-25nt that functions post-transcriptionally to block targeted gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the N gene coding sequences derived from 16 different isolates, and found that nucleotide deletions and substitutions are mainly located at the first 440nt sequence. Combining previous reports and the above sequence information, we create three novel siRNAs that specifically target the conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene. We show that these siRNAs could effectively and specifically block the isolated N gene expression in mammal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that N gene can effectively up-regulate M gene mediated interferon \u03B2 (IFN\u03B2) production, while blocking N gene expression by specific siRNA significantly reduces IFN\u03B2 gene expression. Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of siRNA on the isolated N gene expression might be influenced by the sequence context around the targeted sites.","publish_time":"2011-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Ying-Li; Wang, Ying; Guo, Rong; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Shu-Hui; Liu, Li","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a765ae8d7eae55875cb832428c9082a6e4e4ae82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6259856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317844/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16021544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolated N gene expression","IFN\u03B2 gene expression","targeted gene expression","N gene coding sequences","gene mediated interferon \u03B2","block","specific siRNA","nt sequence","inhibitory effect of siRNA","sequence information","sequence context","targeted sites","ideal target","novel siRNAs","class of small non-coding RNAs","proinflammatory cytokine production","host cell apoptosis","design of small interference RNA","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","SARS-CoV","different isolates","size","mammal cells","major pathological determinant","unexploited regions","nucleotide deletions","immune responses","previous reports","Nucleocapsid","substitutions","data","study","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR.

In recent years, several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prophylaxis in prospective human epidemics. In the current study, eight human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing and non-neutralizing capabilities, directed against different epitopes of the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (MERS-S) protein, were investigated with regard to their ability to immunohistochemically detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV experimentally infected alpacas. The most intense immunoreaction was detected using a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain S1B of the MERS-S protein, which produced an immunosignal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and along the apical membranous region. A similar staining was obtained by two other mAbs which recognize the sialic acid-binding domain and the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2, respectively. Five mAbs lacked immunoreactivity for MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue, even though they belong, at least in part, to the same epitope group. In summary, three tested human mAbs demonstrated capacity for detection of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE samples and may be implemented in double or triple immunohistochemical methods.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haverkamp, Ann-Kathrin; Bosch, Berend J.; Spitzbarth, Ingo; Lehmbecker, Annika; Te, Nigeer; Bensaid, Albert; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim; Baumg\u00E4rtner, Wolfgang","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5036583ad77c21548cff21d909e342a7b059ee9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112921.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242719301710; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242719301710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526954/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2019.109939","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV antigen","detection of MERS","MERS-coronavirus","MERS-S protein","nasal tissue sections of MERS","tested human mAbs","FFPE tissue","human patients","human monoclonal antibodies","neutralizing antibody","FFPE samples","prospective human epidemics","important respiratory disease","non-neutralizing capabilities","receptor binding domain S1B","different epitopes","cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium","respective epitopes","sialic acid-binding domain","protective antibodies","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome","ectodomain","capacity","spike","lethal outcome","formalin-fixed paraffin","immunosignal","membrane fusion subunit S2","investigators","apical membranous region","prophylaxis","current study","immunoreactivity","recent years","infected alpacas","triple immunohistochemical methods","ability","summary","intense immunoreaction","regard","similar staining","epitope group"],"language":"en"},

Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type II diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the renin\u2013angiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of ACE. It is thought to inhibit Ang-II signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-II to generate Ang-(1\u22127), which effects oppose Ang-II and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of ACE2 in diabetes. In this review we will examine the role of the renin\u2013angiotensin system in the physiopathology and treatment of diabetes and highlight the potential benefits of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u22127)/Mas receptor axis, focusing on recent data about ACE2.","publish_time":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bindom, Sharell M.; Lazartigues, Eric","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdb41adab7501ef08fbc8f854528b45525bb47d0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2f67287d0d96e26e77180023bab0068f0d9694bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2676688.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2008.09.020; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2676688?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948167/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303720708004140; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720708004140","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of diabetes","development of diabetes","Diabetes mellitus","new-onset diabetes","role of ACE2","cleaving Ang","angiotensin system","Mas receptor axis","diabetic nephropathy","ACE2 knockout mice","Mas receptor immuno-reactivity","hyperactivity of angiotensin","risk of diabetic complications","renin","mouse pancreas","endocrine pancreas","enzyme","new model","clinical trials","clinical relevance","homolog of ACE","animal models of type","higher fasting blood glucose levels","reduction","kidney","liver","blockade","physiopathology","growing problem","recent data","early phase","potential benefits","adipose tissue","discovered mono-carboxypeptidase","compensatory manner","parts","cascades","pathways","world","expression","presence","review","effects"],"language":"en"},

These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood\u2010sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions. We consider the combination of nucleotide composition, amino acid composition, and codon usage preference suitable to provide information on possible evolutionary similarities between distant virus species that cannot be investigated by phylogeny.","publish_time":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wassenaar, Trudy M.; Jun, Se\u2010Ran; Robeson, Michael; Ussery, David W.","journal":"Microbiologyopen","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d4246494e250c90bb5721a35e2b0a8e20100f20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7002107.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31742930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus species hepatitis","insect virus","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis E virus","Zika virus","Triatoma virus","related virus species","distant virus species","codon usage of HAV","codon usage of human hepatitis","West Nile virus","bat hepatitis","codon usage preference suitable","amino acid composition characteristics","viral species","combination of nucleotide composition","complete viral codon regions","insect host","evolutionary ancestor of HAV","Human pegivirus","related rodent","gene similarity","invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families","possible evolutionary similarities","information","Hepatovirus","strand RNA","Hepacivirus","simian","intraspecies genomic diversity","blood","replication","differences","liver inflammation","contrast","observations","direct sequence homology","Orthohepevirus","kissing bugs","present evidence","mammals","phylogeny"],"language":"en"},

The return of infected pilgrims to their home countries with a putative spread of MERS\u2010CoV necessitates further surveillance. METHODS: A cross sectional study of 839 adult African Hajj pilgrims returning to Accra in Ghana, West Africa, was conducted in 2013 to assess the prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as of MERS\u2010CoV, human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (FLU A) infection. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty\u2010one (77.6%) pilgrims had respiratory symptoms. Tests were positive for at least one of the viruses other than MERS\u2010CoV in 179 (21.3%) of all pilgrims, with 22.4% detection in symptomatic vs. 17.6% detection in asymptomatic pilgrims. No MERS\u2010CoV was detected, although common respiratory viruses were prevalent, with positive findings for HRV in 141 individuals (16.8%), RSV in 43 individuals (5.1%) and FLU A in 11 individuals (1.3%). Results were positive for more than one virus in 16 (1.9%) individuals, including 14 (1.7%) RSV/HRV co\u2010infections and 2 (0.2%) FLU A/HRV co\u2010infections. A total 146 (22.4%) of the symptomatic returnees tested positive for at least one respiratory virus compared with 33 (17.6%) of the asymptomatic pilgrims who had at least one detectable virus in their sample. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was high. Although it is reassuring that MERS\u2010CoV was not detected in the tested population, there is a need for active surveillance of Hajj pilgrims.","publish_time":"2015-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annan, Augustina; Owusu, Michael; Marfo, Kwadwo Sarfo; Larbi, Richard; Sarpong, Francisca Naana; Adu\u2010Sarkodie, Yaw; Amankwa, Joseph; Fiafemetsi, Samuel; Drosten, Christian; Owusu\u2010Dabo, Ellis; Eckerle, Isabella","journal":"Trop Med Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/218a68ea55d8d8c16639de836973a827eef92aca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.12482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25688471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Ghana","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["CoV","asymptomatic pilgrims","respiratory syncytial virus","prevalence of respiratory symptoms","individuals","common respiratory viruses","prevalence of viral respiratory infections","active surveillance of Hajj pilgrims","severe respiratory disease","return of infected pilgrims","adult African Hajj pilgrims","HRV co\u2010infections","RSV","detectable virus","putative spread of MERS","positive findings","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","symptomatic returnees","asymptomatic subjects","detection","RESULTS","tested population","Accra","cross sectional study","home countries","need","human rhinovirus","Ghana","influenza","OBJECTIVE","Arabian Peninsula","West Africa","METHODS","laboratory","CONCLUSIONS","sample","cases","Tests"],"language":"en"},

ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which compromises the stimulus and then determines whether the cell survives or dies. In recent years, ongoing research has suggested that these pathways may be linked to the autophagic response, which plays a key role in the cell\u0027s response to various stressors. Autophagy performs a self-digestion function, and its activation protects cells against certain pathogens. However, the link between the UPR and autophagy may be more complicated. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other. Experimental studies have found that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to escape the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host\u0027s defense to their advantage; thus, this topic is a critical area in antiviral research. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about how RNA viruses, including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, and dengue virus, regulate these processes. We also discuss recent discoveries and how these will produce novel strategies for antiviral treatment.","publish_time":"2014-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jheng, Jia-Rong; Ho, Jin-Yuan; Horng, Jim-Tong","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40b7ed2533e026bb5323b85f9d81379ae0f17821.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4122171.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Endoplasmic"],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","dengue virus","cell\u0027s response","autophagic response","ER stress","Japanese encephalitis virus","hepatitis C virus","unfolded protein response","host immune response","antiviral research","UPR","pathways","ER functions","Autophagy","RNA viruses","different viruses","various stimuli","ongoing research","various stressors","antiviral treatment","recent years","recent discoveries","coxsackievirus","enterovirus","activation","poliovirus","key role","cells","topic","current knowledge","critical area","general term","novel strategies","self-digestion function","advantage","host\u0027s defense","certain pathogens","Experimental studies","Endoplasmic reticulum","review","stimulus","mechanisms","processes","link","induction","systems"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we further showed that 2H6 binds stronger to the NS1 of H5N1 than A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48. A crystal structure of 2H6 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has also been solved and docked onto the NS1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody-antigen complex. In one of the models, the predicted molecular contacts between residues in NS1 and 2H6-Fab correlate well with biochemical results. Taken together, residues N48 and T49 in H5N1 NS1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mAb 2H6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody. Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-2009 and the majority of seasonal H3N2 circulating in humans since 1968 has N48 in NS1, suggesting that mAb 2H6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains.

The application of the visual triage score found a similar percentage of MERS-CoV and non\u2013MERS-CoV patients, with each score from 0 to 11. The percentage of patients with a cutoff score of \u22654 was 75% in patients with MERS-CoV infection and 85% in patients without MERS-CoV infection (p 0.0001).

HRV infections usually lead to more severe and longer duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms in asthmatics than in otherwise healthy individuals. However, the exact mechanism by which viruses contribute to exacerbation of asthma is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study was to investigate the relationship of the enhanced severity of LRT symptoms to viral dynamics or cytokine responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT). STUDY DESIGN: Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study in which asthmatics and healthy controls were followed during natural viral respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Our study confirmed that viral respiratory tract infections caused more severe problems of the LRT in asthma patients as compared to healthy controls. However, for all subjects, the severity of LRT symptoms were not related to viral load or prolonged viral shedding in the URT. In addition, we did not detect differences in proinflammatory cytokines in the URT between asthmatics and controls.

The query protein sequence is dissected into overlapping short sequence segments. Ten different physicochemical features describe each amino acid; therefore nine residues long segment is represented as a point in a 90 dimensional space. The database of sequence segments with confirmed by experiments post-translational modification sites are used for training a set of ANNs. RESULTS: The efficiency of the classification for each type of modification and the prediction power of the method is estimated here using recall (sensitivity), precision values, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and leave-one-out tests (LOOCV). The significant differences in the performance for differently optimized neural networks are observed, yet the AMS 3.0 tool integrates those heterogeneous classification schemes into the single consensus scheme, and it is able to boost the precision and recall values independent of a PTM type in comparison with the currently available state-of-the art methods. CONCLUSIONS: The standalone version of AMS 3.0 presents an efficient way to indentify post-translational modifications for whole proteomes. The training datasets, precompiled binaries for AMS 3.0 tool and the source code are available at http://code.google.com/p/automotifserver under the Apache 2.0 license scheme.","publish_time":"2010-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basu, Subhadip; Plewczynski, Dariusz","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/008c1ceaeffe7abc87b031af39fae2632fa72897.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2874555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423529/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-210","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of post-translational modification","type of modification","sequence information","experiments post-translational modification sites","post-translational modifications","short sequence segments","database of sequence segments","tool","PTM type","standalone version of AMS","precision values","query protein sequence","recall","recent update of AMS algorithm","values independent","available state","neural networks","license scheme","training datasets","heterogeneous classification schemes","artificial neural network","single consensus scheme","amino acid","receiver","efficient way","area","comparison","precompiled binaries","proteins","residues long segment","point","characteristic","ROC","different physicochemical features","performance","prediction power","source code","curves","CONCLUSIONS","Apache","efficiency","sensitivity","proteomes","art methods","dimensional space","significant differences","RESULTS","set of ANNs","tests","LOOCV","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies revealed that PEDV exhibits an obvious capacity for modulating interferon (IFN) signaling or expression. The newly discovered type III IFN, which plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity, has strong antiviral activity against PEDV proliferation in IPEC-J2 cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein on type III IFN-\u03BB. We found that the N proteins of ten PEDV strains isolated between 2013 and 2017 from different local farms shared high nucleotide identities, while the N protein of the CV777 vaccine strain formed a monophyletic branch in the phylogenetic tree. The N protein of the epidemic strain could antagonize type III IFN, but not type I or type II IFN expression induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) in IPEC-J2 cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the inhibition of poly(I:C)- induced IFN-\u03BB3 production by PEDV N protein was dependent on the blocking of nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) nuclear translocation. These findings might help increase understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV and its mechanisms for evading the host immune response.","publish_time":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shan, Ying; Liu, Zi-qi; Li, Guo-wei; Chen, Cong; Luo, Hao; Liu, Ya-jie; Zhuo, Xun-hui; Shi, Xing-fen; Fang, Wei-huan; Li, Xiao-liang","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f12cdefd6a057fbd9230868a7870c27723460f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6052364.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.b1700283; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631/jzus.B1700283.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29971995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV N protein","PEDV proliferation","pathogenesis of PEDV","PEDV strains","IFN expression","effect of PEDV nucleocapsid","N proteins","discovered type","induced IFN-\u03BB3 production","epidemic strain","IPEC-J2 cells","antiviral immunity","NF-\u03BAB","blocking of nuclear factor-\u03BAB","nuclear translocation","inhibition of poly","strong antiviral activity","CV777 vaccine strain","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","enormous economic losses","high nucleotide identities","pigs","result","monophyletic branch","severe diseases","obvious capacity","polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid","different local farms","mechanisms","modulating interferon","worldwide swine industry","crucial role","infectious pathogen","host immune response","phylogenetic tree","understanding","Previous studies","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients. According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists\u0027 confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19.

The assay is based on TaqMan technology, consisting of two primers and one probe labeled with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein that binds selectively to the transmembrane-protein gene of BCoV. The BCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was able to detect the tested BCoV and BCoV-like viruses (canine respiratory coronavirus and bubaline coronavirus), whereas other common viral pathogens of cattle were not recognised by the established oligonucleotide set, thus showing that the test was specific for bovine-like CoVs. The detection limit of the assay was 20 BCoV RNA copies (1-log higher with respect to traditional gel-based RT-PCR) and the reproducibility was satisfactory, thus allowing for a sensitive and accurate measurement of the viral RNA load in clinical samples. Two hundred and twenty clinical specimens (92 rectal, 82 nasal and 46 ocular swabs) were subjected to gel-based and real-time RT-PCR. By conventional amplification, 43 rectal, 54 nasal and 34 ocular samples tested positive, whereas the TaqMan assay was able to detect the BCoV nucleic acid in 49 rectal, 60 nasal and 37 ocular swabs. The rapidity and high throughput of the BCoV TaqMan assay makes this method a powerful tool for a sensitive and specific diagnosis of BCoV infection in cattle.","publish_time":"2008-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decaro, Nicola; Elia, Gabriella; Campolo, Marco; Desario, Costantina; Mari, Viviana; Radogna, Arianna; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Cirone, Francesco; Tempesta, Maria; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88fda71a3c0b92de587a797b3490442822bac919.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112840.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340800181X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579223/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340800181X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCoV TaqMan assay","tested BCoV","BCoV real-time RT-PCR assay","BCoV RNA copies","BCoV nucleic acid","specific diagnosis of BCoV infection","transmembrane-protein gene of BCoV","ocular samples","clinical samples","traditional gel-based RT-PCR","ocular swabs","detection of bovine coronavirus","bubaline coronavirus","viral RNA load","TaqMan technology","clinical specimens","canine respiratory coronavirus","common viral pathogens of cattle","detection limit","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","viruses","log higher","respect","powerful tool","method","accurate measurement","high throughput","reporter dye","probe","carboxyfluorescein","primers","rapidity","reproducibility","established oligonucleotide set","conventional amplification","CoVs"],"language":"en"},

Most research on this topic treats the connections among individuals as static, but these connections change in time, and thus social networks are also temporal networks. Currently there is no theoretical approach to the problem of containing misinformation outbreaks in temporal networks. We thus propose a misinformation spreading model for temporal networks and describe it using a new theoretical approach. We propose a heuristic-containing (HC) strategy based on optimizing final outbreak size that outperforms simplified strategies such as those that are random-containing (RC) and targeted-containing (TC). We verify the effectiveness of our HC strategy on both artificial and real-world networks by performing extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the HC strategy greatly increases the outbreak threshold and decreases the final outbreak threshold.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wei; Ma, Yuanhui; Wu, Tao; Dai, Yang; Chen, Xingshu; Braunstein, Lidia A.","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/238a5e5835d264e37eaceb40a294bd41e94c9513.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31893637/; https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5114853; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10801v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["temporal networks","social networks","real-world networks","HC strategy","misinformation outbreaks","final outbreak threshold","final outbreak size","outbreaks of Internet misinformation","theoretical analyses","new theoretical approach","computer science","network science","social systems","connections change","extensive numerical simulations","variety of fields","problem","simplified strategies","individuals","mathematics","time","topic","societal health","model","researchers","heuristic","effectiveness","TC"],"language":"en"},

The stimulation of passive immunity in the calf by vaccinating the dam for Salmonella has shown some success in previous studies; however, there are no data on the use of currently licensed vaccines in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaccinating cows at dry\u2010off with a commercially available Salmonella bacterial extract would stimulate Salmonella\u2010specific antibodies in the colostrum of cows at calving and whether these antibodies would be transferred to the calf. ANIMALS: Sixty Holstein cattle and 59 calves from a herd presumed to be na\u00EFve to Salmonella. METHODS: Prospective clinical trial. Thirty cows were vaccinated at dry\u2010off with a Salmonella enterica serovar Newport bacterial extract and again 4 weeks later. An additional 30 cows received only saline. Calves fed fresh colostrum from their dam within 4 hours of birth had blood collected 24 hours later. RESULTS: Vaccinated cattle had increased Salmonella Newport antibody titers at calving in blood (P = .01) and colostrum (P = .011). Calves that received colostrum from vaccinated cattle also had significant increase in Salmonella antibodies (1.04 \u00B1 0.03) as compared to calves born to unvaccinated cows (0.30 \u00B1 0.02).

Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel","journal":"Pediatr Infect Dis J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95e7b3d5aac1a54ace50bee0d0cad6efac8cdba8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158880.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310621/; https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002660","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","novel CoVs infections","severe symptoms","SARS-CoV present","novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe disease","novel coronavirus","majority of children","importance of children","humans","adults","gastrointestinal symptoms","severe outbreak of disease","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","fewer symptoms","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","common circulating","Clinical manifestations","lower case-fatality rates","pneumonia","multi-organ failure","treatment","bronchitis","prevention options","termed COVID","documented household contact","focus","large family of enveloped","HKU1","China","diagnostic findings","HCoV2","age group","zoonotic RNA viruses","countries","NL63","death","fever","animals","Preliminary evidence","OC43","review","nosocomial exposure","Coronaviruses","global pandemic","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Human N-myc interactor (Nmi) protein, which has been shown to interact with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins including STAT1, is important for the activation of IFN-\u03B3 induced STAT1-dependent transcription of many genes responsible for IFN-\u03B3 immune responses. However, no proteins encoded by herpesviruses have been reported to interact with Nmi and inhibit Nmi-mediated activation of IFN-\u03B3 immune responses to achieve immune evasion from IFN-\u03B3 responses. In this study, we show strong evidence that the UL23 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a human herpesvirus, specifically interacts with Nmi. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells. We observed that Nmi, when bound to UL23, was not associated with STAT1, suggesting that UL23 binding of Nmi disrupts the interaction of Nmi with STAT1. In cells overexpressing UL23, we observed (a) significantly reduced levels of Nmi and STAT1 in the nuclei, the sites where these proteins act to induce transcription of IFN-\u03B3 stimulated genes, and (b) decreased levels of the induction of the transcription of IFN-\u03B3 stimulated genes. UL23-deficient HCMV mutants induced higher transcription of IFN-\u03B3 stimulated genes and exhibited lower titers than parental and control revertant viruses expressing functional UL23 in IFN-\u03B3 treated cells. Thus, UL23 appears to interact directly with Nmi and inhibit nuclear translocation of Nmi and its associated protein STAT1, leading to a decrease of IFN-\u03B3 induced responses and an increase of viral resistance to IFN-\u03B3. Our results further highlight the roles of UL23-Nmi interactions in facilitating viral immune escape from IFN-\u03B3 responses and enhancing viral resistance to IFN antiviral effects.","publish_time":"2018-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Linyuan; Sheng, Jingxue; Vu, Gia-Phong; Liu, Yujun; Foo, Chingman; Wu, Songbin; Trang, Phong; Paliza-Carre, Marco; Ran, Yanhong; Yang, Xiaoping; Sun, Xu; Deng, Zemin; Zhou, Tianhong; Lu, Sangwei; Li, Hongjian; Liu, Fenyong","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e911d262fbf4b651d8b2f2acb97c71e157a4d4cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5805366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29377960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nmi","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B3 responses","IFN-\u03B3 immune responses","\u03B3 induced responses","decrease of IFN","Interferon-\u03B3","Nmi-mediated activation of IFN","\u03B3 stimulated genes","UL23 binding of Nmi","interaction of Nmi","higher transcription of IFN","Nmi interactions","\u03B3 induced STAT1-dependent transcription","IFN antiviral effects","reduced levels of Nmi","UL23 protein of human cytomegalovirus","functional UL23","human cells","roles of UL23","nuclear translocation of Nmi","human viruses","human herpesviruses","associated protein STAT1","activator of transcription","UL23-deficient HCMV mutants","proteins","viral immune escape","immune evasion","genes responsible","important innate immunity responses","Human N-myc interactor","increase of viral resistance","control revertant viruses","lower titers","host","hybrid screen","co-immunoprecipitation","infections","strong evidence","yeast","induction","nuclei","signal transducer","sites","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we discovered a small molecule with activity against Candida spp. both in vitro and in vivo. We screened a library of 50,240 small molecules for inhibitors of yeast-to-hypha transition, a major virulence attribute of Candida albicans. This screening identified 20 active compounds. Further examination of the in vitro antifungal and anti-biofilm properties of these compounds, using a range of Candida spp., led to the discovery of SM21, a highly potent antifungal molecule (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.2 \u2013 1.6 \u00B5g/ml). In vitro, SM21 was toxic to fungi but not to various human cell lines or bacterial species and was active against Candida isolates that are resistant to existing antifungal agents. Moreover, SM21 was relatively more effective against biofilms of Candida spp. than the current antifungal agents. In vivo, SM21 prevented the death of mice in a systemic candidiasis model and was also more effective than the common antifungal nystatin at reducing the extent of tongue lesions in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. Propidium iodide uptake assay showed that SM21 affected the integrity of the cell membrane.

Study design 202 specimens collected from adult patients with signs of respiratory infection from November, 2008 to May, 2009 were used for evaluating the performance of the three commercial PRV assays. Viral culture and xTAG were used as the standards to assess sensitivity and specificity. Results The PRV assays detected more viruses than culture. When compared to culture, the xTAG PRV showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91%, compared to MultiCode-PLx with 89% and 87%, and ResPlex II with 89% and 94%, respectively. Co-infection was detected in a small subset of patient specimens. Each panel showed differences in sensitivities for individual viruses. Conclusions While the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx offer a broader virus detection range and greater ease of use, the xTAG PRV showed increased sensitivity to common viral targets represented in the assays, and also had the ability to differentiate human from non-human influenza A H1.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balada-Llasat, Joan-Miquel; LaRue, Heidi; Kelly, Cheryl; Rigali, Lisa; Pancholi, Preeti","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cacf69c575667e4fe2e84b872563ed59f55f0ce2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185502.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.09.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210004063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210004063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21050809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ResPlex II Panel v2.","ResPlex II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["xTAG PRV","ResPlex","commercial PRV assays","respiratory viruses","MultiCode-PLX assay","non-human influenza","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","Viral culture","respiratory syncytial virus","echo virus","signs of respiratory infection","increased sensitivity","OC43","adenoviruses","individual viruses","NL63","parainfluenza","specificity","broader virus detection range","seasonal H1","Co-infection","Panel v2","common viral targets","small subset of patient specimens","Abstract Background Commercial multiplex PCR panels","greater ease of use","adult patients","HKU1","coxsackie","bocavirus","differences","sensitivities","Qiagen","ability","EraGen Biosciences","Study design","H3","standards","coronavirus","performance","Luminex","PRV\u0027s","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

However, prevalence of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus infections in cats in northeastern China is unknown. Therefore, the prevalence of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus infections was performed among cats in northeastern China in this study. FINDINGS: Of all samples in this study, the overall seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in cats was 21% (240/1140). It also showed a higher prevalence rate of pandemic(H1N1) 2009 infection in pet cats (30.6%) than roaming cats (11%) based on NT. In addition, the results also showed a trend of difference in term of species of cats and it was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first survey on the seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection among cats in northeastern China.

Some strategies rely on canine immunoglobulins: canine colostrum banking and canine serum/plasma supplementation. Others involve heterologous sources of antibodies and other immune factors: bovine colostrum or hyperimmune egg powder. Among the different solutions evaluated from birth to weaning, canine plasma and hyperimmune egg powder showed promising beneficial effect on puppies\u2019 health. Canine plasma seems to positively impact not only growth (increased growth during the neonatal period), but also digestive health (higher species richness of intestinal microbiota) and the general health (tendency of lower morbidity). Puppies supplemented with hyperimmune egg powder presented increased neonatal growth and decreased risk of canine parvovirus infection. Nevertheless, natural canine maternal colostrum and milk ingestion remains the optimal guarantee for puppies\u2019 health and survival, as a source of immunity, energy and growth factors.","publish_time":"2016-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mila, H; Grellet, A; Mariani, C; Feugier, A; Guard, B; Suchodolski, J; Steiner, J; Chastant\u2010Maillard, S","journal":"Reprod Domest Anim","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a12021eec29c67672307e13d6a60c3735f9e6bb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/rda.12824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canine plasma","canine colostrum banking","canine serum","canine immunoglobulins","puppies\u2019 health","increased growth","natural canine maternal colostrum","growth factors","hyperimmune egg powder","bovine colostrum","increased neonatal growth","general health","digestive health","case of colostrum","immune factors","decreased risk of canine parvovirus infection","milk ingestion","various nutritional hyperimmune supplementations","immunological factors","survival","plasma supplementation","increased risk of infectious diseases","milk intake deficiency","neonatal period","passive immune protection","promising beneficial effect","optimal guarantee","higher species richness of intestinal microbiota","puppy","complex mammary secretions","crucial role","source of immunity","correct development","heterologous sources of antibodies","tendency of lower morbidity","work","energy","birth","strategies","different solutions"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, vaccination of susceptible poultry during an HPAIV outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions. To this end, suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed. Our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge. The aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants. Two adjuvants, namely, Bacterium-like Particles (BLP) and Advax, were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations. Delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that BLP and Advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both. Upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up, BLP and Advax/BLP adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the non-adjuvanted formulation. Remarkably, all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge, but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the Advax group. Overall, our results indicate that passive inhalation is feasible, effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens if it can be adapted to field settings.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomar, Jasmine; Biel, Carin; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Frijlink, Henderik W.; Huckriede, Anke; Hinrichs, Wouter L.J.; Peeters, Ben","journal":"European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c90121a3f539b59d4b528f3a1dd172b75533c0cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126314.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2018.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30312742/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939641118308063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939641118308063","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations","BLP adjuvanted formulations","suitable formulations","dry powder formulations","lethal influenza challenge","Delivery of dry formulations","non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation","mass vaccination of chickens","vaccine dose","Advax group","non-adjuvanted formulation","effective mass vaccination method","human transmission of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus","vaccination of susceptible poultry","effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination","shedding of challenge virus","use of suitable adjuvants","field settings","higher systemic immune responses","mucosal immune responses","HPAIV outbreak","human population","present study","previous study","vaccinated animals","normal breathing results","partial protection","optimized set-up","flu pandemic","Abstract Bird","significant risk","best remedy","lungs","potential","syrinx","freeze","Bacterium","Particles","end","transmissions","aim"],"language":"en"},

Activities include performing effective chest compressions, assessing and restoring a perfusing cardiac rhythm, stabilizing the airway, and treating the underlying cause of the arrest. While the existing critical care literature has appropriately focused on the patient, there has been a dearth of information discussing the various stresses to the healthcare team. This review summarizes the available literature regarding occupational risks to medical emergency teams, characterizes these risks, offers preventive strategies to healthcare workers, and highlights further research needs. METHODS: We performed a literature search of PubMed for English articles of all types (randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies, case reports and series, editorials and commentaries) through September 22, 2016, discussing potential occupational hazards during resuscitation scenarios. Of the 6266 articles reviewed, 73 relevant articles were included. RESULTS: The literature search identified six potential occupational risk categories to members of the resuscitation team\u2014infectious, electrical, musculoskeletal, chemical, irradiative, and psychological. Retrieved articles were reviewed in detail by the authors. CONCLUSION: Overall, we found there is limited evidence detailing the risks to healthcare workers performing resuscitation. We identify these risks and offer potential solutions.

Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl\u2010\u03B2\u2010cyclodextrin, as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin\u20101, had no effect on DENV\u20102 virus infection. It was also shown, by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore, that dynamin was required for DENV\u20102 entry. Consequently, the infectious entry of DENV\u20102 into Vero cells occurs by a non\u2010classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolae and lipid rafts, but dependent on dynamin. By contrast, DENV\u20102 entry into A549 cells was clathrin\u2010dependent, as previously reported in HeLa, C6/36 and BS\u2010C\u20101 cells. Our results conclusively show, for the first time, a differential mode of infective entry for DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 into a common host cell, Vero cells, as well as alternative entry pathways for a given serotype, DENV\u20102, into different types of cells.","publish_time":"2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acosta, Eliana G.; Castilla, Viviana; Damonte, Elsa B.","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aedcbf29dcf8ecc0cf24cccd05124571f06fe258.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523154/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01345.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious entry of DENV","productive DENV","transfection of Vero cells","A549 cells","alternative entry pathways","different types of cells","differential mode of infective entry","dominant negative form","dominant negative caveolin","endocytic pathways","treatment","dynamin","non\u2010classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin","dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins","biochemical inhibitors","inhibitors nystatin","dengue virus","virus infection","cell system","common host cell","caveolae","Eps15 protein","overexpression","mediated endocytosis","fluorescence microscopy","lipid rafts","methyl","chlorpromazine","given serotype","internalization","serotypes","infectivity determinations","cyclodextrin","inhibitor dynasore","BS","effect","K44A mutant","C6","time","HeLa","dansylcadaverine","contrast","results"],"language":"en"},

TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen. The authors posit that activation of the TLR radical (ROS/RNS) cycle is a common pathway underpinning many \u201Ccivilization\u201D disorders and that targeting the TLR radical cycle may be an effective method to treat many inflammatory disorders.","publish_time":"2013-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucas, Kurt; Maes, Michael","journal":"Mol Neurobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e15cc5f01dcaed41e70dadf719e4950c667d3d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-013-8425-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23436141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TLR4 pathways","Activation","TLR radical cycle","TLR-related diseases","neuroinflammatory disorders","autoimmune disorders","molecular patterns","anti-LPS strategies","TLR-mediated inflammation","chronic inflammation","synthetic anti-LPS peptides","molecular hydrogen","human diseases","abovementioned diseases","chronic fatigue syndrome","long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate","increased production of reactive oxygen","metabolic syndrome","bipolar disorder","cardiovascular disorder","toluene inhalation","promising drugs","recombinant factor C","clinical depression","autism","atmosphere particulate matter","pentachlorophenol","obesity","schizophrenia","alcohol abuse","nitrogen species","diabetes","damage","N-acetylcysteine","MyD88 antagonists","ionizing radiation","nitrosative stress","effective method","CyP","cinnamon extract","melatonin","eritoran","ozone","asthma","potential","lipopolysaccharide","pathogen","common pathway","pattern recognition receptors","shogaol","innate immune system","pathophysiology","complex","epigallocatechin","gallate","TLRs","agents","gram-negative bacteria","civilization","Toll","substances","authors"],"language":"en"}]}

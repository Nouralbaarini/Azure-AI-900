Despite a limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs serve as candidates for application, not only in infected individuals but also as prophylaxis to prevent infection establishment. Here we use a stochastic model to describe the early phase of a viral infection. We find that the critical efficacy needed to block viral establishment is typically above 80%. This value can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment can still sometimes be prevented; for that purpose, drugs blocking viral entry into target cells (or equivalently enhancing viral clearance) are more effective than drugs reducing viral production or enhancing infected cell death. When a viral infection cannot be prevented because of high exposure or low drug efficacy, antivirals can still delay the time to reach detectable viral loads from 4 days when untreated to up to 30 days. This delay flattens the within-host epidemic curve, and possibly reduces transmission and symptom severity. These results suggest that antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk. It could thus be an important component of the strategy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the months or years to come.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Czuppon, P.; Debarre, F.; Goncalves, A.; Tenaillon, O.; Perelson, A.

(2) To assess the perceived usefulness of social media and other forms of media for COVID-19 public health campaigns. Design: A descriptive WhatsApp messenger-based cross-sectional survey in April 2020. Setting: Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTH) and 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda. Participants: HCPs at MUTH and MS in the 9 medical schools in Uganda. Main outcome measures: We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, sources of information on COVID-19, preferences of social media platform and perceived usefulness of the different media platforms for acquisition of knowledge on COVID-19. Results: Overall, response rate was 21.5% for both MS and HCPs. In total, 877 (HCPS [136, 15.5%], MS [741, 85.5%]) were studied. Majority (n=555, 63.3%) were male with a median age of 24 (range: 18-66) years. Social media was a source of information for 665 (75.8%) participants. Usage was similar among MS and HCPs (565/741 (76.2%) vs. 100/136 (73.5%), p=0.5). Among the MS, commonly used social media were: WhatsApp (n=705, 95.1%) Facebook (n=405, 54.8%), Twitter (n=290, 39.1%), Instagram (n=178, 24.0) and Telegram (n=80, 10.8%).

Mass media (television and radio) and social media were preferred the most useful tools for dissemination of COVID-19 related information. Conclusion: More than two-thirds of MS and HCPs are routinely using social media in Uganda. Social media platforms may be used for dissemination of information as well as a research tool among MS and HCPs. Social media alongside other media platforms can also be used as sources of reliable information on COVID-19 as well as for dissemination of research findings and guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olum, R.; Bongomin, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0154e1b0a8d927ae668898a87cb018bbbbfe45d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20086553v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Makerere University Teaching Hospitals","MUTH"],"locations":["Uganda"],"keyphrases":["social media platforms","usage of social media","forms of media","Mass media","perceived usefulness of social media","HCPs","preferences of social media platform","different media platforms","male MS","thirds of MS","dissemination of COVID","dissemination of information","Uganda","sources of information","related information","source of information","sources of reliable information","medical schools","medical students","MUTH","dissemination of research findings","Participants","descriptive WhatsApp messenger","research tool","data","healthcare professionals","Makerere University Teaching Hospitals","sociodemographic characteristics","acquisition of knowledge","television","radio","useful tools","Setting","cross-sectional survey","public health campaigns","Main outcome measures","range","median age","Design","guidelines","response rate","Results","Facebook","Twitter","Instagram","Telegram","years","Conclusion","Majority","total","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings. Methods: A hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures. Findings: Sri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic. Interpretation: The hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable. This methodological approach can be replicated in other settings at the initial stages of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perera, S. N.; Ganegoda, N.

Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, Rc, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining Rc at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, a progressive lowering of Rc below 1.0. The full sequence of measures that we are observing in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: R0 \u2192 Rc\u003CR0 \u2192 Rc\u003C\u003C1.0 \u2192 Rc\u22481.0 \u2192 Rc\u003C1.0.

In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lung\u2019s functionality like-responses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting host\u2019s proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients.

While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeCaprio, Dave; Gartner, Joseph A; Burgess, Thadeus; Kothari, Sarthak; Sayed, Shaayaan; McCall, Carol J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5a2bc9046ae7ae60d3ac2d98720bf7049902698.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individuals","COVID","severe complications","greatest risk","models","acute respiratory disease","particular disease","information specific","upper respiratory infections","varying levels of predictive effectiveness","outreach campaigns","expense of ease","diseases worst effects","high mortality rates","preexisting medical conditions","pandemic","World Health Organization","implementation","proxy","results"],"language":"en"},

Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and handwashing access is limited. Objectives: To estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019. Results: Despite overall improvements from 1990 (34.7% [95% uncertainty interval 32.5-36.7] without access) to 2019 globally, in 2019, 2.01 (1.89-2.13) billion people equal to 26.0% (24.4-27.6) of the global population lacked access to handwashing. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more than 50 million persons lacked access. Discussion: For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brauer, M.; Zhao, J.

Leptin produced in visceral fat might play a role in the deterioration to mechanical ventilation. A cross sectional study was performed. The mean BMI was 31 kg/m2 (range 24.8-48.4) for the 31 SARS-CoV-2 ventilated patients and 26 kg/m2 (range 22.4-33.5) for the 8 controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a similar BMI as control patients appear to have significantly higher levels of serum leptin.

With these findings we designed a clinical and biological framework that explains clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This is enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide are implementing a range of intervention measures, such as population-wide social distancing and case isolation, with the goal of reducing Reff to values below one, to slow or eliminate transmission. We analyse case data from 25 international locations to estimate their Reff values over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions, equivalent to New Zealand\u0027s Alert Levels 1-4, for reducing transmission. Our results show that strong interventions, equivalent to NZ\u0027s Alert Level 3 or 4, have been successful at reducing Reff below the threshold for outbreak. In general, countries that implemented strong interventions earlier in their outbreak have managed to maintain case numbers at lower levels.

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ju, Bin; Zhang, Qi; Ge, Xiangyang; Wang, Ruoke; Yu, Jiazhen; Shan, Sisi; Zhou, Bing; Song, Shuo; Tang, Xian; Yu, Jinfang; Ge, Jiwan; Lan, Jun; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Haiyan; Zhao, Juanjuan; Zhang, Shuye; Wang, Youchun; Shi, Xuanling; Liu, Lei; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3af33a7ac2bffc8e944d65efbfbf954ec82c861d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.990770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic SARS-CoV","live SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV","RBD binding","infected plasma cross","potent neutralizing antibodies","impressive binding","substantial plasma cross-reactivity","neutralizing activity","ACE2 receptor","neutralizing characteristics","RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies","viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain","RBDs","cross-recognition target regions","diverse families of antibody heavy","mAbs","antibody response","target cell receptor","therapeutic interventions","particular families","coexistence of germline","infected individuals","urgent need of prophylactic","trimeric Spike proteins","germline divergent clones","light chains","apparent enrichment","pseudovirus","serious global public health emergency","promising candidates","competition","enzyme","single B cells","clone types","cellular entry","characterization","angiotensin","analyses","repertoire","results","potency","pandemic","specificity","investigation","patient","isolation","samples"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this note is to study alternatives to Lockdown which are either more targeted or allows partial opening of the economy. Cities are often spatially organized into wards. We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic.

The number of travelers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Methods: We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning, or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2007 to 2016. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel, and the association between a state\u0027s FSI score and air travel. Results: Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of passengers increased from 0.791 billion to 1.28 billion between 2007 and 2016. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The greatest increase was observed for travel to Warning countries from Warning countries, with an annual increase of 8,967,623 passengers (95%CI: 6,546,494 to 11,388,753) over the study period. Conclusions: The world\u0027s connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuite, Ashleigh R; Bhatia, Deepit; Moineddin, Rahim; Bogoch, Isaac; Watts, Alexander G; Khan, Kamran","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/447c606a4b4aeb4c066160c4243666695258c80f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046904","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FSI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Warning countries","worldwide air travel","Stable countries","quarters of international air travel passengers","travel volumes","countries of different FSI categories","outbound international air passengers","FSI rankings","Increased connectivity","state\u0027s FSI score","international air passenger numbers","infectious disease threats","annual increase","trends","infectious disease events","total number of passengers","risk of disease introduction","annual measure of country","world\u0027s connectivity","unit increase","geographic spread of infectious diseases","greatest increase","order of increasing fragility","passenger origin","different capacities","suboptimal capacity","sovereign states","number of travelers","time period","study period","Fragile States Index","association","level resilience","destination","Alert","Background","notable growth","decrease","Conclusions","data","years","Methods","reduction","borders","past decade","Results"],"language":"en"},

The historic daily published 78,842 confirmed cases in England up to 13/4/2020 in each of 149 Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) were converted to Average Daily Infection Rate (RADIR), an R-value - the number of further people infected by one infected person after their 5-day incubation and during their 5-day infectious phase, and the associated Rate of Change of Infection Rate (\u03B4IR) also calculated. Results compared to look for significant variances between regions. Stepwise regression was carried out to see what local factors could be linked to the difference in local infection rates. The peak of COVID-19 infection has passed. The current RADIR is now below 1. The rate of decline is such that within 14 days it may be below 0.5. There are significant variations in the current RADIR and \u03B4IR between the UTLAs, suggesting that the disease locally may be at different stages. Regression analysis across UTLAs found that the only factor that could be related to the fall in RADIR was an increase in the number of confirmed infection/1,000 population. Extrapolation of these results showed that based on assuming a link to increased immunity, unreported community infection may be over 200 times higher than the reported confirmed cases providing evidence that by the end of the second week in April 26% of the population may already have had the disease and so now have increased immunity. Linking these increased estimated infected numbers to recorded deaths indicates a possible mortality rate of 0.14%.

It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured. We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death. We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tradigo, Giuseppe; Guzzi, Pietro Hiram; Veltri, Pierangelo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/769d953d28605c51f20b2fd049ffabc4d73583a7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","Intensive Care Units"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of COVID","percentage of COVID","infected number of patients","affected patients","number of deaths","estimated number of infections","diffusing low cost reliable COVID","infected citizens","affected countries","pandemic diffusion","virus diffusion","SARS-CoV","European countries","recent pandemic disease","tests","governments","tracking people activities","symptoms","viruses","flu","matter of current intuition","hospitalisation","effects of restriction actions","high temperature","early detection","Intensive Care Units","mortality rates of diseases","ICUs","efforts","MERS","family","H1N1","world","portion","Italian regions","healthcare system","relations","contacts","model","USA","ones","characterisation","medical swabs","China","end","Italy"],"language":"en"},

One of the peculiar clinical characteristics of ALS is the wide distribution in age of onset, which is probably caused by different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors. We investigated whether these modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a differential proteomic analysis was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset \u226455 years and a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset \u226575 years, and matched healthy controls. We identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in the two groups of patients. Gene ontology analysis revealed that there was a significant enrichment in annotations associated with protein folding and response to stress. We next validated a selected number of proteins belonging to this functional group in 85 patients and 83 age- and sex-matched healthy controls using immunoassays. The results of the validation study confirmed that there was a decreased level of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (also known as cyclophilin A), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (also known as BiP) and protein deglycase DJ-1 in PBMC of ALS patients with an early onset. Similar results were obtained in PBMC and spinal cord from two SOD1(G93A) mouse models with an early and late disease onset. This study suggests that a different ability to upregulate proteins involved in proteostasis, such as foldase and chaperone proteins, may be at the basis of a different susceptibility to ALS, putting forward the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at boosting the protein quality control system.","publish_time":"2017-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filareti, Melania; Luotti, Silvia; Pasetto, Laura; Pignataro, Mauro; Paolella, Katia; Messina, Paolo; Pupillo, Elisabetta; Filosto, Massimiliano; Lunetta, Christian; Mandrioli, Jessica; Fuda, Giuseppe; Calvo, Andrea; Chi\u00F2, Adriano; Corbo, Massimo; Bendotti, Caterina; Beghi, Ettore; Bonetto, Valentina","journal":"Front Mol Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9663f9f18256ca7161c2af2ce451911c90f629da.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2dd6dd3a860b840098976e99c1124ea89466e77c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382314.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBMC of ALS patients","age of onset","populations of ALS patients","early onset","late disease onset","groups of patients","peculiar clinical characteristics of ALS","chaperone proteins","protein deglycase DJ","heat shock protein HSP","kDa glucose-regulated protein","years","protein quality control system","functional group","different ability","different susceptibility","selected number of proteins","sex-matched healthy controls","fatal neurodegenerative disease","different combinations of intrinsic","relevant pathways","exogenous factors","modifying factors","therapeutic intervention","validation study","Similar results","common pathogenic pathways","differential proteomic analysis","development of therapeutic approaches","Gene ontology analysis","alpha","SOD1","G93A","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","mouse models","prolyl cis-trans isomerase","wide distribution","lower motor neuron degeneration","decreased level of peptidyl","BiP","spinal cord","proteostasis","annotations","cyclophilin","immunoassays","basis","significant enrichment","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","foldase","response","identification of phenotypic biomarkers","stress"],"language":"en"},

However, to date, such a miRNA profiling study has not been conducted for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection. METHODS: The relative abundance of 169 miRNAs was measured in bovine serum collected at three different phases of FMDV infection in a proof-of-concept study using miRNA PCR array plates. RESULTS: Alterations in specific miRNA levels were detected in serum during acute, persistent, and convalescent phases of FMDV infection. Subclinical FMDV persistence produced a circulating miRNA profile distinct from cattle that had cleared infection. bta-miR-17-5p was highest expressed during acute infection, whereas bta-miR-31 was the highest during FMDV persistence. Interestingly, miR-1281was significantly down-regulated during both acute and persistent infection. Cattle that cleared infection resembled the baseline profile, adding support to applying serum miRNA profiling for identification of sub-clinically infected FMDV carriers. Significantly regulated miRNAs during acute or persistent infection were associated with cellular proliferation, apoptosis, modulation of the immune response, and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role for non-coding regulatory RNAs in FMDV infection of cattle. Future studies will delineate the individual contributions of the reported miRNAs to FMDV replication, determine if this miRNA signature is applicable across all FMDV serotypes, and may facilitate development of novel diagnostic applications.

In this study, 25 full-length CDV genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. The results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (H, F, P, N, L, M) of the CDV genome. The analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the CDV genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. The six recombination events were detected using SimPlot and RDP programs. The analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the CDV individual gene were under negative selection.

One reason is premature oncolytic virus clearance in humans, which is a reasonable assumption considering the immune-stimulating nature of the oncolytic agents. However, several studies are beginning to reveal layers of restriction to oncolytic virotherapy that are present before an adaptive neutralizing immune response. Some of these barriers are present constitutively halting infection before it even begins, whereas others are raised by minute cues triggered by virus infection. Indeed, we and others have noticed that delivering viruses to tumors may not be the biggest obstacle to successful therapy, but instead the physical make-up of the tumor and its capacity to mount antiviral defenses seem to be the most important efficacy determinants. In this review, we summarize the constitutive and innate barriers to oncolytic virotherapy and discuss strategies to overcome them.","publish_time":"2014-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"V\u00E4h\u00E4-Koskela, Markus; Hinkkanen, Ari","journal":"Biomedicines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6deb91c6796184b969f10b262910634eeff4a33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5423468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5423468/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Oncolytic virotherapy","oncolytic agents","premature oncolytic virus clearance","virus infection","innate barriers","therapeutic efficacy","halting infection","important efficacy determinants","adaptive neutralizing immune response","humans","days","successful therapy","capacity","biggest obstacle","physical make-up","conception","nature","layers of restriction","reasonable assumption","tumors","antiviral defenses","clinics","minute cues","strategies","level","animal models","viruses","studies","review"],"language":"en"},

We reanalyze data for Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), native to North America, but invasive in Europe. Our main finding was that, when the analysis extent is established carefully based on analogous sets of environmental conditions, all evidence of niche shifts disappears, suggesting that previous reports of niche shifts for this species are artifacts of methods and interpretation, rather than biological reality. Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers.

Spread of PTB is mainly provoked by a long subclinical stage during which MAP is shed into the environment with feces; accordingly, detection of subclinical animals is very important to its control. However, current diagnostic methods are not suitable for detection of subclinical animals. Therefore, the current study was conducted to develop a diagnostic method for analysis of the expression of genes of prognostic potential biomarker candidates in the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with MAP. Real-time PCR with nine potential biomarker candidates was developed for the diagnosis of MAP subclinical infection. Animals were divided into four groups based on fecal MAP PCR and serum ELISA. Eight genes (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) were up-regulated in MAP-infected cattle (p \u003C0.05). Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that eight genes (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) showed fair diagnostic performance (AUC\u22650.8). Four biomarkers (Timp1, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR positive and ELISA negative group (PN group) and three biomarkers (Tfrc, Hp, and Serpine1) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR negative and ELISA positive group (NP group). Moreover, three biomarkers (S100a8, Hp, and Defb10) were considered the most reliable for the PCR positive and ELISA positive group (PP group). Taken together, our data suggest that real-time PCR based on eight biomarkers (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) might be useful for diagnosis of JD, including subclinical stage cases.","publish_time":"2017-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hyun-Eui; Park, Hong-Tae; Jung, Young Hoon; Yoo, Han Sang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14f427656a9898ce76f31cb012f258a9aa6d1ce3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5444815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5444815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR positive","Defb10","Hp","S100a8","ELISA positive group","fecal MAP PCR","ELISA negative group","PCR negative","Serpine1","Tfrc","Real-time PCR","Timp1","biomarkers","PN group","NP group","PP group","diagnosis of MAP subclinical infection","detection of subclinical animals","MAP-infected cattle","highest diagnostic accuracy","Mmp9","current diagnostic methods","long subclinical stage","subclinical stage cases","serum ELISA","fair diagnostic performance","expression of genes","PTB","prognostic potential biomarker candidates","diagnosis of JD","blood of cattle","Bovine paratuberculosis","ROC analysis","current study","chronic enteric inflammatory disease of ruminants","Mycobacterium avium","large economic losses","dairy industry","groups","AUC","feces","environment","control","data"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate whether HRV infection induces a specific gene expression pattern in airway epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial cell monolayers were infected with HRV species B (HRV-B). RNA was extracted from both supernatants and infected monolayer cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) and transcriptional profile was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip and the results were subsequently validated using quantitative Real-time PCR method. HRV-B infects alveolar epithelial cells which supports implication of the virus with LRTIs. In total 991 genes were found differentially expressed during the course of infection. Of these, 459 genes were up-regulated whereas 532 genes were down-regulated. Differential gene expression at 6 hpi (187 genes up-regulated vs. 156 down-regulated) were significantly represented by gene ontologies related to the chemokines and inflammatory molecules indicating characteristic of viral infection. The 75 up-regulated genes surpassed the down-regulated genes (35) at 12 hpi and their enriched ontologies fell into discrete functional entities such as regulation of apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, and wound healing. At later time points of 24 and 48 hpi, predominated down-regulated genes were enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and airway remodeling events. Our data provides a comprehensive image of host response to HRV infection.

Although rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients, the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract remains unknown. We evaluated 697 recipients transplanted between 1993 and 2015 with rhinovirus in respiratory samples. As comparative cohorts, 273 recipients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (N=117), parainfluenza virus (N=120), or influenza (N=36) were analyzed. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 569 subjects with rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection and 128 subjects with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection, probabilities of overall mortality at 90 days were 6% and 41%, respectively (P\u003C0.001). The survival rate after lower respiratory tract infection was not affected by the presence of co-pathogens (55% in patients with co-pathogens, 64% in patients without, P=0.34). Low monocyte count (P=0.027), oxygen use (P=0.015), and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day (P=0.003) before diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality among patients with lower respiratory tract infection in multivariable analysis. Mortality after rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection was similar to that after lower respiratory tract infection by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or influenza in an adjusted model. In summary, transplant recipients with rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract had high mortality rates comparable to viral pneumonia associated with other well-established respiratory viruses.

The present study was performed to investigate the potential protective effect of myricitrin against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury and its underlying mechanisms. Myricitrin pretreatment improved cardiomyocyte viability, inhibited ROS generation, maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced apoptotic cardiomyocytes, decreased the caspase-3 activity, upregulated antiapoptotic proteins and downregulated proapoptotic proteins during H/R injury. Moreover, the potential targets of myricitrin was predicted using Discovery Studio software, and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as the main disease-related target. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that 17-AAG, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Hsp90, significantly blocked the myricitrin-induced cardioprotective effect demonstrated by increased apoptosis and ROS generation. These results suggested that myricitrin provides protection to H9c2 cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, most likely via increased expression of Hsp90.","publish_time":"2017-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Min; Sun, Gui-bo; Du, Yu-yang; Tian, Yu; Liao, Ping; Liu, Xue-song; Ye, Jing-xue; Sun, Xiao-bo","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03ca47766e6f3e8d5d71fa25d86803f82d690b38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5462924.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5462924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R injury","potential targets of myricitrin","potential protective effect of myricitrin","myricitrin-induced cardioprotective effect","induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury","Myricitrin pretreatment improved cardiomyocyte viability","increased apoptosis","H9c2 cardiomyocytes","increased expression of Hsp90","inhibited ROS generation","mitochondrial membrane potential","Modulation of oxidative stress","pharmacologic inhibitor of Hsp90","apoptotic cardiomyocytes","downregulated proapoptotic proteins","upregulated antiapoptotic proteins","hypoxia","Discovery Studio software","heat shock protein","caspase","activity","AAG","ischemia","protection","reoxygenation","underlying mechanisms","phenolic compound","reperfusion","main disease-related target","potent antioxidant","cardiac myocytes","mechanistic investigation","results","present study"],"language":"en"},

In mouse models, variation in the Oas1b gene influences host susceptibility to flavivirus infection. However, the impact of Oas variation on overall innate immune programming and global gene expression among tissues and in different genetic backgrounds has not been defined. We examined how Oas1b acts in spleen and brain tissue to limit West Nile virus (WNV) susceptibility and disease across a range of genetic backgrounds. The laboratory founder strains of the mouse Collaborative Cross (CC) (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ) all encode a truncated, defective Oas1b, whereas the three wild-derived inbred founder strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) encode a full-length OAS1B protein. We assessed disease profiles and transcriptional signatures of F1 hybrids derived from these founder strains. F1 hybrids included wild-type Oas1b (F/F), homozygous null Oas1b (N/N), and heterozygous offspring of both parental combinations (F/N and N/F). These mice were challenged with WNV, and brain and spleen samples were harvested for global gene expression analysis. We found that the Oas1b haplotype played a role in WNV susceptibility and disease metrics, but the presence of a functional Oas1b allele in heterozygous offspring did not absolutely predict protection against disease. Our results indicate that Oas1b status as wild-type or truncated, and overall Oas1b gene dosage, link with novel innate immune gene signatures that impact specific biological pathways for the control of flavivirus infection and immunity through both Oas1b-dependent and independent processes.","publish_time":"2017-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, Richard; Wilkins, Courtney; Thomas, Sunil; Sekine, Aimee; Hendrick, Duncan M.; Voss, Kathleen; Ireton, Renee C.; Mooney, Michael; Go, Jennifer T.; Choonoo, Gabrielle; Jeng, Sophia; de Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Ferris, Martin T.; McWeeney, Shannon; Gale, Michael","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6e5eab626d98db430e725caeec26c95ee086f86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5473748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","WSB/EiJ","F/N and N/F"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Oas1b-dependent","Oas1b acts","Oas1b status","Oas1b haplotype","defective Oas1b","wild-type Oas1b","overall Oas1b gene dosage","Oas1b gene influences host susceptibility","homozygous null Oas1b","functional Oas1b allele","full-length OAS1B protein","gene locus","novel innate immune gene signatures","WNV susceptibility","global gene expression analysis","disease profiles","disease metrics","wild-derived inbred founder strains","innate immune programming","innate immune resistance","laboratory founder strains","EiJ","control of flavivirus infection","heterozygous offspring","impact of Oas variation","transcriptional signatures of F1 hybrids","different genetic backgrounds","range of genetic backgrounds","brain tissue","spleen samples","mouse models","West Nile virus","mouse Collaborative Cross","link","CAST","specific biological pathways","tissues","role","parental combinations","ShiLtJ","NOD","129S1","PhJ","PWK","presence","immunity","SvImJ","WSB","CC","oligoadenylate-synthetase","NZO","HlLtJ","C57BL","independent processes","protection","results","mice"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, we observed that TRAF6 overexpression significantly inhibited CSFV replication, and TRAF6 knockdown promoted CSFV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages. Additionally, TRAF6 was degraded during CSFV infection or NS3 expression exclusively, indicating that CSFV and TRAF6 were mutually antagonistic and that TRAF6 degradation might contribute to persistent CSFV replication. Moreover, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) activity and interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 and interleukin (IL)-6 expression were increased in TRAF6-overexpressing cells, whereas TRAF6-knockdown cells exhibited decreased NF-\u03BAB activity and IFN-\u03B2 and IL-6 levels. Notably, TRAF6 overexpression did not reduce CSFV replication following inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation by p65 knockdown. Our findings revealed that TRAF6 inhibits CSFV replication via activation of NF-\u03BAB-signalling pathways along with increases in the expression of its targets IFN-\u03B2 and IL-6.

This process leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells and facilitates bacterial access to an uninfected host cell in a direct manner. Despite its importance in virulence, the mechanism of the T6SS-5 and the role of host cell factors in cell-cell fusion remain elusive. To date, the T6SS-5 is the only system of bacterial origin known to induce host-cell fusion. To gain insight into the nature of T6SS-5-stimulated membrane fusion, we investigated the contribution of cholesterol and proteins exposed on the host cell surface, which were shown to be critically involved in virus-mediated giant cell formation. In particular, we analyzed the effect of host cell surface protein and cholesterol depletion on the formation of multinucleated giant cells induced by B. thailandensis. Acute protease treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages during infection with B. thailandensis followed by agarose overlay assays revealed a strong reduction in the number of cell-cell fusions compared with EDTA treated cells. Similarly, proteolytic treatment of specifically infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells significantly decreased multinucleated giant cell formation. Furthermore, modulating host cell cholesterol content by acute cholesterol depletion from cellular membranes by methyl- \u03B2-cyclodextrin treatment or exogenous addition of cholesterol impaired the ability of B. thailandensis to induce cell-cell fusions. The requirement of physiological cholesterol levels suggests that the membrane organization or mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence the fusion process. Altogether, our data suggest that membrane fusion induced by B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis involves a complex interplay between the T6SS-5 and the host cell.","publish_time":"2017-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whiteley, Liam; Haug, Maria; Klein, Kristina; Willmann, Matthias; Bohn, Erwin; Chiantia, Salvatore; Schwarz, Sandra","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f889617cc2152ead5c5070ee3ee24dcf86248bad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5626464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. thailandensis"],"organizations":["EDTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell fusions","host-cell fusion","uninfected host cell","adjacent host cell","number of cell","role of host cell factors","multinucleated giant cell formation","modulating host cell cholesterol content","effect of host cell surface protein","cytoplasm of host cells","formation of multinucleated giant cells","fusion process","plasma membrane fusion","stimulated membrane fusion","contribution of cholesterol","acute cholesterol depletion","uninfected recipient cells","nature of T6SS","exogenous addition of cholesterol","infected donor cells","membrane organization","related species Burkholderia thailandensis","requirement of physiological cholesterol levels","Burkholderia pseudomallei","cyclodextrin treatment","proteolytic treatment","Acute protease treatment of RAW264","system of bacterial origin","bacterial access","secretion system","methyl- \u03B2","cellular membranes","type","strong reduction","lipid bilayer","agarose overlay assays","mechanical properties","macrophages","ability of","proteins","infection","direct manner","EDTA","complex interplay","virulence","mechanism","escape","virus","importance","insight","data","date"],"language":"en"},

No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of \u003E10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2\u002B) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.","publish_time":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shaobo; Liu, Yang; Guo, Jiao; Wang, Peilin; Zhang, Leike; Xiao, Gengfu; Wang, Wei","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bd2f6497996fc0fccd8dffd7f84846d3d36f964.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5640845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzczMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of JEV","hit drugs","mouse model of JEV infection","conferred JEV resistance","JEV-induced lethality","clinical JEV isolates","specific treatment of JEV infections","Repurposing of approved drugs","viral replication","viral load","treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection","cytoplasmic calcium","approved therapy","study","additional types of calcium inhibitors","FDA-approved drug library","viral growth profile","major cause of acute viral encephalitis","library of FDA","available vaccines","Zika virus","toxicity of manidipine","flaviviruses","novel antiviral target","Adaptive mutant analysis","antiflavivirus candidates","antiviral activities","therapeutic possibilities","therapeutic stratagem","exerting antiflavivirus activity","apparent loss","transmembrane domain","replacement of Q130","voltage-gated Ca","high-throughput screening","channel","humans","mice","development","nonstructural NS4B protein","histopathological changes","VGCC","brain","IMPORTANCE","selective index","arthropod","findings","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

Mounting data show that substantial critical illness-induced changes in the immune system can be observed in most ICU patients and that not only \u201Chyper-inflammation\u201D but also persistence of an anti-inflammatory phenotype (as in sepsis-associated immunosuppression) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite common perception, changes in functional immunity cannot be adequately assessed by routine inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or numerical analysis of leukocyte (sub)-counts. Cytokines appear also not suited due to their short half-life and pleiotropy, their unexclusive origin from immune cells, and their potential to undergo antagonization by circulating inactivating molecules. Thus, beyond leukocyte quantification and use of routine biomarkers, direct assessment of immune cell function seems required to characterize the immune systems\u2019 status. This may include determination of, e.g., ex vivo cellular cytokine release, phagocytosis activity, and/or antigen-presenting capacity. In this regard, standardized flow-cytometric assessment of the major histocompatibility-II complex human leukocyte antigen (-D related) (HLA-DR) has gained particular interest. Monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) controls the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity and may serve as a \u201Cglobal\u201D biomarker of injury-associated immunosuppression, and its decreased expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., secondary infection risk, mortality).

Conventional mAb immunotherapy has numerous logistical and practical limitations, including high production costs and a requirement for frequent dosing due to short mAb serum half-life. In this report, we describe a novel strategy of antibody-based immunotherapy against prostate carcinoma that utilizes synthetic DNA plasmids that encode a therapeutic human mAb that target PSMA. Electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection of the DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) plasmid into mice led to the production of functional and durable levels of the anti-PSMA antibody. The anti-PSMA produced in vivo controlled tumor growth and prolonged survival in a mouse model.

In addition to encoding the amino acid sequence for Gag, the underlying RNA sequence could encode cis-acting elements or nucleotide biases that are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, RNA sequences that inhibit viral replication could be suppressed in gag. However, the functional relevance of RNA elements and nucleotide biases that promote or repress HIV-1 replication remain poorly understood. RESULTS: To characterize if the RNA sequence in gag controls HIV-1 replication, the matrix (MA) region was codon modified, allowing the RNA sequence to be altered without affecting the protein sequence. Codon modification of nucleotides (nt) 22-261 or 22-378 in gag inhibited viral replication by decreasing genomic RNA (gRNA) abundance, gRNA stability, Gag expression, virion production and infectivity. Comparing the effect of these point mutations to deletions of the same region revealed that the mutations inhibited infectious virus production while the deletions did not. This demonstrated that codon modification introduced inhibitory sequences. There is a much lower than expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 and codon modification introduced a substantial increase in CpG abundance. To determine if they are necessary for inhibition of HIV-1 replication, codons introducing CpG dinucleotides were mutated back to the wild type codon, which restored efficient Gag expression and infectious virion production. To determine if they are sufficient to inhibit viral replication, CpG dinucleotides were inserted into gag in the absence of other changes. The increased CpG dinucleotide content decreased HIV-1 infectivity and viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV-1 RNA sequence contains low abundance of CpG dinucleotides. Increasing the abundance of CpG dinucleotides inhibits multiple steps of the viral life cycle, providing a functional explanation for why CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in HIV-1.

Since March 2016, four Zika cases have been confirmed in Zhejiang, China. Rapid assessment of people\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding Zika is crucial to its prevention and control. Web-based surveys to assess public KAP may be a growing trend; however, we had little experience with this method. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore KAP regarding Zika in residents of Zhejiang using both traditional paper- and innovative Internet-based investigations. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A paper-based version of the survey was used in a cross-sectional community study following multistage cluster random sampling, and an Internet-based survey was promoted through a local health education site. Data were interpreted via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 447 community residents participated in the paper-based survey, with a response rate of 89.4% (447/500), and 621 eligible Internet users participated in the Internet-based survey, with a response rate of 36.92% (621/1682). Age, education level, and occupation differed significantly between participants in the paper- and Internet-based surveys. Participants completing the Internet-based survey were much younger (\u03C7(2)(2)=144.7, P\u003C.001) and had a higher level of education (\u03C7(2)(2)=423.5, P\u003C.001) than those completing the paper-based survey. Among participants completing the paper-based survey, there were more farmers, housewives, and unemployed people (\u03C7(2)(3)=413.7, P\u003C.001). Overall, 83.52% of participants (892/1068) knew the transmission route for Zika, 76.12% (813/1068) knew that pregnant women were at high risk of severe complications, 66.39% (709/1068) knew that contracting Zika during pregnancy could lead to newborn babies with microcephaly, and 98.88% (1056/1068) knew places where mosquitos could usually be found. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, participants completing the Internet-based survey were more likely to know the transmission route of Zika (odds ratio [OR]=5.0, 95% CI 3.0-8.0), the association between pregnant women with Zika and newborn babies with microcephaly (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.0), and that pregnant women were at high risk for Zika (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.5-8.4) than those completing the paper-based survey. They were less likely to worry about contracting Zika (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) and more likely to actively seek information about Zika than participants completing the paper-based survey (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.0-5.6). CONCLUSIONS: Participants completing the Internet-based survey had a higher level of basic knowledge and more positive attitudes and behaviors than participants completing the paper-based survey. In addition to providing Web-based health information, the government should ensure sufficient access to health information for the elderly and less educated people in the community to improve health equity.","publish_time":"2017-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yu; Xu, Shuiyang; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Yushui; Liu, He; Yao, Dingming; Xu, Yue; Lv, Qiaohong; Hao, Gang; Xu, Yan; Wu, Qingqing","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5684512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5684512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP","Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["Zhejiang","China"],"keyphrases":["paper-based survey","Internet-based surveys","paper-based version","participants","Web-based health information","innovative Internet-based investigations","Web-based surveys","traditional paper","Zika cases","use of traditional community-based health education methods","Internet increases","transmission route of Zika","health workers","health equity","education level","eligible Internet users","local health education site","higher level of education","community residents","pregnant women","public KAP","residents of Zhejiang","cross-sectional community study","public access","higher level of basic knowledge","newborn babies","prevention","microcephaly","response rate","Zhejiang Provincial Center","positive attitudes","sufficient access","high risk of severe complications","Disease Control","unemployed people","educated people","Rapid assessment of people\u2019s knowledge","multistage cluster random sampling","government","practices","farmers","behaviors","housewives","questionnaire","odds ratio","occupation","growing trend","univariate","total","pregnancy","sociodemographic variables","association","addition","multivariate analyses","little experience","Data","OBJECTIVES","aim","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","places","mosquitos","China"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrate that the repeating protein subunit pattern common to most virus capsids is a molecular pattern that induces a Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2)-dependent antiviral immune response. This early antiviral immune response regulates the clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections, which are a primary cause of morbidities associated with influenza virus infections. Utilizing this altered susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge as an outcome, we determined that multiple unrelated, empty, and replication-deficient capsids initiated early TLR2-dependent immune responses, similar to intact influenza virus or murine pneumovirus. These TLR2-mediated responses driven by the capsid were not dependent upon the capsid\u2019s shape, size, origin, or amino acid sequence. However, they were dependent upon the multisubunit arrangement of the capsid proteins, because unlike intact capsids, individual capsid subunits did not enhance bacterial clearance. Further, we demonstrated that even a linear microfilament protein built from repeating protein subunits (F-actin), but not its monomer (G-actin), induced similar kinetics of subsequent bacterial clearance as did virus capsid. However, although capsids and F-actin induced similar bacterial clearance, in macrophages they required distinct TLR2 heterodimers for this response (TLR2/6 or TLR2/1, respectively) and different phagocyte populations were involved in the execution of these responses in vivo. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 responds to invading viral particles that are composed of repeating protein subunits, indicating that this common architecture of virus capsids is a previously unrecognized molecular pattern.","publish_time":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shepardson, Kelly M.; Schwarz, Benjamin; Larson, Kyle; Morton, Rachelle V.; Avera, John; McCoy, Kimberly; Caffrey, Alayna; Harmsen, Ann; Douglas, Trevor; Rynda-Apple, Agnieszka","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b67993220966ebef79688b594d852e4da9bbadb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5686532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5686532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral capsids","early TLR2-dependent immune responses","intact capsids","similar bacterial clearance","TLR2-mediated responses","common architecture of virus capsids","repeating protein subunits","clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections","dependent antiviral immune response","similar kinetics of subsequent bacterial clearance","intact influenza virus","subsequent bacterial challenge","rapid immune responses","distinct TLR2 heterodimers","early antiviral immune response","replication-deficient capsids","influenza virus infections","individual capsid subunits","repeating protein subunit pattern common","capsid proteins","F-actin","unrecognized molecular pattern","linear microfilament protein","G-actin","molecular patterns","viral pathogen","viral particles","origin","size","macrophages","primary cause of morbidities","outcome","capsid\u2019s shape","murine pneumovirus","altered susceptibility","multisubunit arrangement","viruses","amino acid sequence","PAMPs","execution","Toll","monomer","different phagocyte populations","receptor","results","surface"],"language":"en"},

In vitro assays revealed a structural alteration in the capsid induced upon HSV(EdC) binding to solid supports that allowed coupling to external capture agents and demonstrated that the vast majority of individual virions contained bioorthogonally-tagged genomes. Using HSV(EdC) in vivo we reveal novel aspects of the kinetics, localisation, mechanistic entry requirements and morphological transitions of infecting genomes. Uncoating and nuclear import was observed within 30 min, with genomes in a defined compaction state (ca. 3-fold volume increase from capsids). Free cytosolic uncoated genomes were infrequent (7\u201310% of the total uncoated genomes), likely a consequence of subpopulations of cells receiving high particle numbers. Uncoated nuclear genomes underwent temporal transitions in condensation state and while ICP4 efficiently associated with condensed foci of initial infecting genomes, this relationship switched away from residual longer lived condensed foci to increasingly decondensed genomes as infection progressed. Inhibition of transcription had no effect on nuclear entry but in the absence of transcription, genomes persisted as tightly condensed foci. Ongoing transcription, in the absence of protein synthesis, revealed a distinct spatial clustering of genomes, which we have termed genome congregation, not seen with non-transcribing genomes. Genomes expanded to more decondensed forms in the absence of DNA replication indicating additional transitional steps. During full progression of infection, genomes decondensed further, with a diffuse low intensity signal dissipated within replication compartments, but frequently with tight foci remaining peripherally, representing unreplicated genomes or condensed parental strands of replicated DNA. Uncoating and nuclear entry was independent of proteasome function and resistant to inhibitors of nuclear export. Together with additional data our results reveal new insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome uncoating, transport and organisation.","publish_time":"2017-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sekine, Eiki; Schmidt, Nora; Gaboriau, David; O\u2019Hare, Peter","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5be812ecd3a63e7b5e718f17d9ca3a0d0fdb4a70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5697887.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5697887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decondensed genomes","unreplicated genomes","Uncoated nuclear genomes","total uncoated genomes","non-transcribing genomes","condensed foci of initial infecting genomes","morphological transitions of infecting genomes","Free cytosolic uncoated genomes","distinct spatial clustering of genomes","nuclear entry","spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome uncoating","absence of transcription","nuclear import","EdC","spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome transport","tight foci","absence of DNA replication","inhibitors of nuclear export","genome congregation","initiation of infection","progression of infection","Inhibition of transcription","Ongoing transcription","decondensed forms","mechanistic entry requirements","absence of protein synthesis","temporal transitions","replication compartments","condensation state","additional data","additional transitional steps","defined compaction state","parental strands of replicated DNA","localisation","new insight","independent of proteasome function","cells","coupling","kinetics","consequence of subpopulations","solid supports","bioorthogonal traceable precursors","external capture agents","viruses","diffuse low intensity signal","results","binding","ICP4","high particle numbers","vast majority of individual virions","fold volume increase","novel aspects","relationship","effect","organisation","structural alteration","capsids","assays"],"language":"en"},

In this study, RNA-Seq technology was applied to investigate the transcriptome-wide changes of DF-1 cells upon ARV infection at the middle stage. RESULTS: Total RNA of ARV-infected or mock-infected samples at 10 and 18 h post infection (hpi) was extracted to build RNA-Seq datasets. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed that the expressions of numerous genes were altered, and a panel of differentially expressed genes were confirmed with RT-qPCR. At 10 hpi, 104 genes were down-regulated and 64 were up-regulated, while the expressions of 47 genes were increased and only one was down-regulated, which may play a role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, at 18 hpi in the ARV-infected cells. The similar profiles of up-regulated genes between the two groups of infected cells suggest that ARV infection activated a prolonged antiviral response of host cells. Alternative splicing analysis found no significantly changed events altered by ARV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the differential expression profile presented in this study can be used to expand our understanding of the comprehensive interactions between ARV and the host cells, and may be helpful for us to reveal the pathogenic mechanism on the molecular level.

Mitophagy is an essential component to normal pancreatic \u03B2-cell function and has been associated with \u03B2-cell failure in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our previous studies have indicated that mitochondrial Rho (Miro) GTPase-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction under high nutrient stress leads to NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3)-dependent proinflammatory responses and subsequent insulin resistance. However, the in vivo mechanism by which Miro1 underlies mitophagy has not been identified. Here we show firstly that the expression of Miro is reduced in human T2D and mouse db/db islets and in INS-1 cell line exposed to high glucose and palmitate. \u03B2-cell specific ablation of Miro1 (Miro1f/f: Rip-cre mice, or (IKO) under high nutrient stress promotes the development of hyperglycemia. \u03B2-cells from IKO mice display an inhibition of mitophagy under oxidative stress and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Dysfunctional mitophagy in IKO mice is represented by damaged islet beta cell mitochondrial and secretory capacity, unbalanced downstream MKK-JNK signalling without affecting the levels of MEK, ERK or p38 activation and subsequently, impaired insulin secretion signaling via inhibition IRS-AKT-Foxo1 pathway, leading to worsening glucose tolerance in these mice. Thus, these data suggest that Miro1 may be responsible for mitophagy deficiency and \u03B2-cell dysfunction in T2D and that strategies target Miro1 in vivo may provide a therapeutic target to enhance \u03B2-cell mitochondrial quality and insulin secretion to ameliorate complications associated with T2D.","publish_time":"2017-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lingling; Liu, Chunyan; Gao, Jianfeng; Xie, Zhiwen; Chan, Lawrence W.C.; Keating, Damien J.; Yang, Yibin; Sun, Jiazhong; Zhou, Fuling; Wei, Yongchang; Men, Xiuli; Yang, Sijun","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5fb59693963a0b96d112341f8f2a9f2b1d7a34c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5710878.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710878/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-cell dysfunction","\u03B2-cell mitochondrial quality","\u03B2-cell failure","mitochondrial dysfunction","cell line","Mitochondrial function","\u03B2-cells","\u03B2-cell specific ablation of Miro1","high nutrient stress","normal pancreatic \u03B2-cell function","mitochondrial Rho","inhibition of mitophagy","IKO mice","damaged islet beta cell mitochondrial","high glucose","mitophagy deficiency","Dysfunctional mitophagy","oxidative stress","human T2D","strategies target Miro1","impaired insulin secretion","Rip-cre mice","subsequent insulin resistance","metabolic demand of pancreatic beta cells","db islets","mouse db","essential component","therapeutic target","expression of Miro","inhibition IRS-AKT","worsening glucose tolerance","secretory capacity","Miro1f","unbalanced downstream MKK-JNK signalling","Foxo1 pathway","dependent proinflammatory responses","p38 activation","GTPase","levels of MEK","NLRP3","NOD","Type","ERK","receptor","diabetes","complications","development of hyperglycemia","previous studies","palmitate","data","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Data from these surveillance systems showed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in West Africa later than in other regions of the continent. METHODS: We contacted 11 West African countries to collect information about their influenza surveillance systems (number of sites, type of surveillance, sampling strategy, populations sampled, case definitions used, number of specimens collected and number of specimens positive for influenza viruses) for the time period January 2010 through December 2012. RESULTS: Of the 11 countries contacted, 8 responded: Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. Countries used standard World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or slight variations thereof. There were 70 surveillance sites: 26 SARI and 44 ILI. Seven countries conducted SARI surveillance and collected 3114 specimens of which 209 (7%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive SARI patients, 132 (63%) were influenza A [68 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 64 influenza A(H3N2)] and 77 (37%) were influenza B. All eight countries conducted ILI surveillance and collected 20,375 specimens, of which 2278 (11%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive ILI patients, 1431 (63%) were influenza A [820 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 611 influenza A(H3N2)] and 847 (37%) were influenza B. A majority of SARI and ILI case-patients who tested positive for influenza (72% SARI and 59% ILI) were children aged 0\u20134 years, as were a majority of those enrolled in surveillance. The seasonality of influenza and the predominant influenza type or subtype varied by country and year. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to circulate in West Africa along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B during 2010\u20132012.

While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours after trauma, 20% occur later and are mainly due to healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Preventing underinflation of the tracheal cuff is recommended to reduce microaspiration, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Automatic devices facilitate the regulation of tracheal cuff pressure, and their implementation has the potential to reduce VAP. The objective of this work is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of VAP compared with intermittent control in severe trauma patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre randomised controlled and open-label trial will include patients suffering from severe trauma who are admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation to longer than 48 hours. Their tracheal cuff pressure will be monitored either once every 8 hours (control group) or continuously using a pneumatic device (intervention group). The primary end point is the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) at day 28. The secondary end points include the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU, early (\u22647 days) or late (\u003E7 days) VAP, time until the first VAP diagnosis, the number of ventilator-free days and antibiotic-free days, the length of stay in the ICU, the proportion of patients with ventilator-associated events and that die during their ICU stay.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiological metric of injurious inflation derived from matched inspiratory and expiratory CT scans, calibrate it in a model of experimental lung injury, and test it in patients with ARDS. METHODS: 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed. RESULTS: In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p\u003C0.01). In patients with ARDS, a threshold fraction of tissue with unstable inflation was apparent: \u003E28% in all patients who died and \u226428% in all who survived, whereas segregation of survivors versus non-survivors was not possible based on oxygenation or lung mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: A single set of superimposed inspiratory\u2013expiratory CT scans may predict progression of lung injury and outcome in ARDS; if these preliminary results are validated, this could facilitate clinical trial recruitment and individualised care.","publish_time":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cereda, Maurizio; Xin, Yi; Hamedani, Hooman; Bellani, Giacomo; Kadlecek, Stephen; Clapp, Justin; Guerra, Luca; Meeder, Natalie; Rajaei, Jennia; Tustison, Nicholas J; Gee, James C; Kavanagh, Brian P; Rizi, Rahim R","journal":"Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c47eea51db8f16e9de1d4303cfe054cc39416cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c3e85c0632ee31d2327ceb70161066e29a02d499.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5738538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5738538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS","expiratory CT scans","patients","progression of lung injury","spectrum of lung injury","model of experimental lung injury","expiratory images","regions of lung","lung mechanics","unstable inflation","sequential scans","subsequent progression of injury","single set of superimposed inspiratory","non-survivors","clinical trial design","clinical trial recruitment","radiological metric of injurious inflation","segregation of survivors","individualised care","experimental studies","preliminary results","Uncertain prediction of outcome","acid aspiration model","intensive care unit week","acute respiratory distress syndrome","individual patient management","areas","threshold fraction of tissue","reflecting local strain","reversible airspace","anaesthetised rats","terms of progressive infiltrates","oxygenation","voxels","baseline","impaired compliance","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","hours","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, the incidence of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) infections in the ICU increased sharply in 2007 by around 120%, and these infections have continued to cause a serious problem to this day. METHODS: We conducted a seven-year prospective cohort study between 2007 and 2014 in the ICU. Early in the epidemic, a case-control study was performed that included MDR-Ab cases diagnosed between 2007 and 2008 and uninfected controls admitted to the ICU during the same time. RESULTS: The total number of patients with MDR-Ab infections diagnosed between 2007 and 2014 was 128. There were also 99 patients with MDR-Ab colonization without evidence of active infection between 2011 and 2014. The incidence of MDR-Ab transmission was 315.4 cases/1000 ICU patient-days. The majority of infections were considered hospital-acquired (84%) and most consisted of respiratory infections (53.1%). The mortality rate of patients with MDR-Ab ranged from 52% to 66%. CONCLUSION: MDR-Ab infections mostly consisted of ventilator-associated pneumonia and were associated with a very high mortality rate. Infection control measures should be reinforced to control the transmission of these organisms in the ICU.","publish_time":"2018-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanafani, Zeina A.; Zahreddine, Nada; Tayyar, Ralph; Sfeir, Jad; Araj, George F.; Matar, Ghassan M.; Kanj, Souha S.","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5597ebd7856aac6f61a0d64e9da8cb0ef2448049.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5778738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778738/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDR-Ab infections","MDR-Ab cases","MDR-Ab colonization","incidence of MDR","Ab transmission","serious infections","majority of infections","consisted of respiratory infections","ICU patient-days","mortality rate of patients","case-control study","Infection control measures","total number of patients","high mortality rate","Acinetobacter species","serious problem","incidence of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii","evidence of active infection","ventilator-associated pneumonia","year prospective cohort study","American University of Beirut Medical Center","intensive care units","decades","RESULTS","epidemic","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","uninfected controls","hospital","organisms","time","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Various Chinese herbal polysaccharides can activate the immune system. Cistanche deserticola (CD) is a traditional Chinese herb and an adjuvant candidate. Here, we confirmed that water-extractable polysaccharides of CD (WPCD) could modulate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. In a dose-dependent manner, WPCD significantly promoted the maturation and function of murine marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) through up-regulating the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, allogenic T cell proliferation, and the yields of IL-12 and TNF-\u03B1 via toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), as indicated by in vitro experiments. In addition, its immunomodulatory activity was also observed in mice. WPCD effectively improved the titers of IgG, IgG(1) and IgG(2a) and markedly enhanced the proliferation of T and B cells, the production of IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 in CD4(\u002B) T cells and the expression level of IFN-\u03B3 in CD8(\u002B) T cells better than Alum. Furthermore, WPCD could markedly up-regulate the expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on DCs in spleen and down-regulate the Treg frequency. The study suggests that polysaccharides of Cistanche deserticola are a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant for eliciting both humoral immunity and cellular immunity by activating DCs via TLR4 signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2018-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ailian; Yang, Xiumei; Li, Quanxiao; Yang, Yu; Zhao, Gan; Wang, Bin; Wu, Daocheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85d7376aca04b7df9b23618734948c2814ccfe19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5779666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779666/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cistanche"],"organizations":["WPCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","WPCD","proliferation of T","B cells","effective vaccine adjuvant","polysaccharides of Cistanche deserticola","expression levels of CD40","CD80","adjuvant candidate","allogenic T cell proliferation","BM-DCs","expression level of IFN","expression levels of MHC","TLR4","titers of IgG","Various Chinese herbal polysaccharides","water-extractable polysaccharides of CD","function of murine marrow-derived dendritic cells","humoral immunity","cellular immunity","production of IFN","yields of IL","immune system","immune responses","traditional Chinese herb","maturation","modern vaccines","toll","TNF-\u03B1","CD86","spleen","dose-dependent manner","immunomodulatory activity","receptor4","study","addition","mice","pathway","Alum","Treg frequency","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccines are commonly used to prevent infection, episodes of diarrhea caused by RV frequently occur. Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against RV infection in piglets. Following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks, the piglets were orally challenged with RV. We found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. Resveratrol-treatment inhibited the TNF-\u03B1 production, indicating that the anti-RV activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response. The IFN-\u03B3 level was elevated in 10mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group and 30mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group after RV infection. The ratios of CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group, suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in RV-infected piglets.

Since the chicken embryo becomes immunocompetent prior to hatch, we here characterized the transcriptional response of selected innate immune genes to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in chicken embryos at days 10, 14, and 18 of embryonic development. The results suggest that the innate immune response 72 h after challenge of 18-day chicken embryo is both consistent and robust. The expression of CCL5, Mx1, and TLR3 in lung tissues of NDV challenged chicken embryos from the outbred Kuroiler and Tanzanian local ecotype lines showed that their expression was several orders of magnitude higher in the Kuroiler than in the local ecotypes. Next, the expression patterns of three additional innate-immunity related genes, IL-8, IRF-1, and STAT1, were examined in the highly congenic Fayoumi (M5.1 and M15.2) and Leghorn (Ghs6 and Ghs13) sublines that differ only at the microchromosome bearing the major histocompatibility locus. The results show that the Ghs13 Leghorn subline had a consistently higher expression of all genes except IL-8 and expression seemed to be subline-dependent rather than breed-dependent, suggesting that the innate immune response of chicken embryos to NDV infection may be genetically controlled by the MHC-locus. Taken together, the results suggest that the chicken embryo may represent a promising model to studying the patterns and sources of variation of the avian innate immune response to infection with NDV and related pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schilling, Megan A.; Katani, Robab; Memari, Sahar; Cavanaugh, Meredith; Buza, Joram; Radzio-Basu, Jessica; Mpenda, Fulgence N.; Deist, Melissa S.; Lamont, Susan J.; Kapur, Vivek","journal":"Front Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd75883b3cd3c5b39b7cc9db85f682047961e1a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5835104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune response of chicken embryos","avian innate immune response","NDV infection","immune response of chickens","higher expression","expression patterns","transcriptional response of selected innate immune genes","day chicken embryo","expression of CCL5","results","additional innate-immunity related genes","lung tissues of NDV","Ghs13 Leghorn subline","subline-dependent","outbred Kuroiler","related pathogens","breed-dependent","local ecotypes","MHC-locus","orders of magnitude higher","major histocompatibility locus","Tanzanian local ecotype lines","Newcastle disease virus","challenge","sources of variation","TLR3","Mx1","promising model","enhanced biosecurity","microchromosome","sublines","animal trials","hatch","days","compromise welfare","M5","M15","Ghs6","IRF","Traditional approaches","congenic Fayoumi","embryonic development","confounding variables","STAT1"],"language":"en"},

These include the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines. Current therapies for RA and other autoimmune diseases reduce inflammation by targeting inflammatory mediators, most of which are innate response cytokines, resulting in generalized immunosuppression. Overall, this strategy has been very successful, but not all patients respond, responses can diminish over time and numerous side effects can occur. Therapies that target the germinal center (GC) reaction and/or antibody-secreting plasma cells (PC) potentially provide a novel approach. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is an IKK-related serine/threonine kinase best characterized for its involvement in innate antiviral responses through the induction of type I interferons. TBK1 is also gaining attention for its roles in humoral immune responses. In this review, we discuss the role of TBK1 in immunological pathways involved in the development and maintenance of antibody responses, with particular emphasis on its potential relevance in the pathogenesis of humoral autoimmunity. First, we review the role of TBK1 in the induction of type I IFNs. Second, we highlight how TBK1 mediates inducible T cell co-stimulator signaling to the GC T follicular B helper population. Third, we discuss emerging evidence on the contribution of TBK1 to autophagic pathways and the potential implications for immune cell function. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of TBK1 inhibition in autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2018-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Louis, Cynthia; Burns, Chris; Wicks, Ian","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61be2db10d752ec61e879d76e6328b6d676a0f55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5845716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of TBK1","contribution of TBK1","humoral immune responses","therapeutic potential of TBK1 inhibition","dysregulated immune responses","maintenance of antibody responses","innate antiviral responses","potential relevance","potential implications","immune cell function","pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases","induction of type","pathogenesis of humoral autoimmunity","review","innate response cytokines","autophagic pathways","immunological pathways","aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines","threonine kinase","inflammatory mediators","Current therapies","inducible T cell co-stimulator","GC T follicular B helper population","TANK-binding kinase","antibody-secreting plasma cells","PC","environmental triggers","rheumatoid arthritis","particular emphasis","SLE","systemic lupus erythematosus","generation of pathogenic autoantibodies","reaction","inflammation","involvement","development","IKK-related serine","genetic predisposition","germinal center","roles","attention","generalized immunosuppression","time","emerging evidence","effects","novel approach","interferons","IFNs","patients","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Antisense-mediated exon-skipping is a promising therapeutic strategy that makes use of synthetic nucleic acids to skip frame-disrupting exon(s) and allows for short but functional protein expression by restoring the reading frame. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eteplirsen, which skips DMD exon 51 and is applicable to approximately 13% of DMD patients. Multiple exon skipping, which is theoretically applicable to 80\u201390% of DMD patients in total, have been demonstrated in animal models, including dystrophic mice and dogs, using cocktail antisense oligonucleotides (AOs). Although promising, current drug approval systems pose challenges for the use of a cocktail AO. For example, both exons 6 and 8 need to be skipped to restore the reading frame in dystrophic dogs. Therefore, the cocktail of AOs targeting these exons has a combined therapeutic effect and each AO does not have a therapeutic effect by itself. The current drug approval system is not designed to evaluate such circumstances, which are completely different from cocktail drug approaches in other fields. Significant changes are needed in the drug approval process to promote the cocktail AO approach.","publish_time":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aslesh, Tejal; Maruyama, Rika; Yokota, Toshifumi","journal":"Biomedicines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc1a1a0fec049e850789175fe06b1453c9114c62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5874658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Food and Drug Administration","FDA","AO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DMD exon","cocktail drug approaches","cocktail of AOs","DMD patients","drug approval process","Drug Administration","cocktail AO approach","DMD gene","current drug approval systems","cocktail antisense oligonucleotides","reading frame","Multiple exon","Antisense-mediated exon-skipping","promising therapeutic strategy","dystrophic dogs","combined therapeutic effect","exons","dystrophic mice","use of synthetic nucleic acids","challenges","eteplirsen","functional protein expression","animal models","mutations","FDA","lethal disorder","Duchenne muscular dystrophy","Food","total","fields","Significant changes","circumstances","example"],"language":"en"},

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. This allows the government to program the measures to loosen lockdown restrictions for the so called \u0022Phase 2\u0022. Here we provided the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24th to April 24th, 2020 across two months into the epidemic. Our estimates suggest basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29, confirming that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed at the early stage of Wuhan (China) outbreak. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to low the reproduction number under the unity (control regime). We estimated that among the worst hit regions in Italy, Lombardy reached the control regime on March 22nd followed by Emilia-Romagna (March 23th), Veneto (March 25th) and Piemonte (March 26th). Overall, we found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime in all the country is about 31 days from the February 24th and about 14 days from the first day of nationwide lockdown (March 12th). Finally, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two demographic indices in order to probe the \u0022state of activity\u0022 of the epidemic for each Italian region in the control regime.

In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Longxiang; Hong, Na; Zhou, Xiang; He, Jie; Ma, Yingying; Jiang, Huizhen; Han, Lin; Chang, Fengxiang; Shan, Guangliang; Zhu, Weiguo; Long, Yun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","Baidu Maps","SEIR"],"locations":["Beijing","China","Guangzhou","Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["metropolitan areas of China","spread of COVID","emerging cases","predicted peak number of cases","spread pattern","high-risk metropolitan areas","travel restrictions","likely number of infections","basic reproductive number","transmission dynamics of COVID","basis of reported data","results of different levels of parameters","estimation results","prediction results","level of restrictions","lessons","Beijing","potential","peak time","experiences","addition","understanding","large cities","big cities","daily travel intensity index","regulation measures","prevention measures","model of infection","group of SEIR model statistical parameters","center","Markov chain Monte Carlo","methods","MCMC","fitting","Baidu Maps app","official quarantine regulations","new coronavirus disease outbreak","Wuhan","social activities","businesses","proportion","secondary outbreaks","R0","evidences","rigorous control","end","effect","public health interventions","Guangzhou","quarantined population","epidemic","Shanghai","example","Shenzhen","city"],"language":"en"},

Its diagnostic value was supported by studies with methodological concerns and its use is controversial. Here we investigated its potential to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic patients and to screen asymptomatic patients in a prospective study with minimal selection bias. Methods: From March 19, 2020 to April 20, 2020 we performed parallel SARS-CoV-2 PCR and CT with categorization of COVID-19 suspicion by CO-RADS, in 859 patients with COVID-19 symptoms and 1138 controls admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 unrelated medical urgencies. CT-CORADS was categorized on a 5-point scale from 1 (very low suspicion) to 5 (very high suspicion). AUC under ROC curve were calculated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients to predict positive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and likelihood ratios for each CO-RADS score were used for rational selection of diagnostic thresholds. Findings: CT-CORADS had significant (P\u003C0.0001) diagnostic power in both symptomatic (AUC=0.891) and asymptomatic (AUC=0.700) patients hospitalized during SARS-CoV-2 peak prevalence. In symptomatic patients (41.7% PCR\u002B), CO-RADS [\u2265] 3 detected positive PCR with high sensitivity (89.1%) and 72.5% specificity. In asymptomatic patients (5.3% PCR\u002B), a CO-RADS score [\u2265] 3 detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with low sensitivity (45.0%) but high specificity (88.8%). Interpretation: CT-CORADS has meaningful diagnostic power in symptomatic patients, supporting its application for time-sensitive triage.

Objectives We aimed to develop an air interface EVOC using pig tracheas in the study of influenza infection demonstrating that tracheal explants can be effectively maintained in organ culture and support productive influenza infection. Methods Tracheal explants were maintained in the air interface EVOC system for 7 days.

Results Histological analysis and bead clearance assay showed that the tissue architecture of the explants was maintained for up to 7 days, while ciliary movement exhibited a gradual decrease after 4 days.

The environmental cues that lead to temporal and spatial control of L. monocytogenes virulence gene expression are poorly understood. In this study, we took advantage of the robust up-regulation of ActA that occurs intracellularly and expressed Cre recombinase from the actA promoter and 5\u2019 untranslated region in a strain in which loxP sites flanked essential genes, so that activation of actA led to bacterial death. Upon screening for transposon mutants that survived intracellularly, six genes were identified as necessary for ActA expression. Strikingly, most of the genes, including gshF, spxA1, yjbH, and ohrA, are predicted to play important roles in bacterial redox regulation. The mutants identified in the genetic selection fell into three broad categories: (1) those that failed to reach the cytosolic compartment; (2) mutants that entered the cytosol, but failed to activate the master virulence regulator PrfA; and (3) mutants that entered the cytosol and activated transcription of actA, but failed to synthesize it. The identification of mutants defective in vacuolar escape suggests that up-regulation of ActA occurs in the host cytosol and not the vacuole. Moreover, these results provide evidence for two non-redundant cytosolic cues; the first results in allosteric activation of PrfA via increased glutathione levels and transcriptional activation of actA while the second results in translational activation of actA and requires yjbH. Although the precise host cues have not yet been identified, we suggest that intracellular redox stress occurs as a consequence of both host and pathogen remodeling their metabolism upon infection.","publish_time":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reniere, Michelle L.; Whiteley, Aaron T.; Portnoy, Daniel A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff6ee9512267f847d91a0185e794ac98f15fe5d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945081.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945081/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ActA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of ActA","ActA expression","transcriptional activation of actA","actA promoter","translational activation of actA","ActA-dependent cell","activated transcription of actA","results","transposon mutants","host cytosol","allosteric activation of PrfA","bacterial redox regulation","environmental cues","identification of mutants defective","precise host cues","master transcriptional regulator PrfA","master virulence regulator PrfA","facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen","non-redundant cytosolic cues","bacterial death","essential genes","cytosolic compartment","yjbH","monocytogenes virulence gene expression","rapid cytosolic growth","intracellular redox stress","vacuolar escape","environmental saprophyte","Listeria monocytogenes","increased glutathione levels","spatial control of","well-defined life-cycle","strain","phagosome","consequence","evidence","loxP sites","untranslated region","important roles","genetic selection","spxA1","Cre recombinase","broad categories","ohrA","advantage","gshF","metabolism","infection","screening","vacuole","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, we developed a workflow that uses sensitive methods to quantitatively and qualitatively assess immune responses against foreign antigens with regard to antibody binding affinity and epitope diversity. The application of such detailed assessments throughout an immunization campaign can significantly reduce the resources required to generate highly specific antibodies. Our workflow consists of the following two steps: 1) the use of surface plasmon resonance to quantify antigen-specific antibodies and evaluate their apparent binding affinities, and 2) the recovery of serum IgGs using an automated small scale purification system, followed by the determination of their epitope diversity using hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry. We showed that these methods were sensitive enough to detect antigen-specific IgGs in the nanogram/\u03BCl range and that they provided information for differentiating the antibody responses of the various immunized animals that could not be obtained by conventional methods. We also showed that this workflow can guide the selection of an animal that produces high affinity antibodies with a desired epitope coverage profile, resulting in the generation of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibody clones with desirable functional profiles. We postulate that this workflow will be an important tool in the development of effective vaccines to combat the highly sophisticated evasion mechanisms of pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Danlin; Frego, Lee; Lasaro, Marcio; Truncali, Kristopher; Kroe-Barrett, Rachel; Singh, Sanjaya","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1cd72dfc8c71714d7751a0b9820f8f8e0ee3756.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4965583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4965583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["workflow","therapeutic antibody","antibody binding affinity","polyclonal antibody responses","antigen-specific antibodies","epitope diversity","sensitive methods","high affinity antibodies","immunization campaign","immune responses","quality of immunization","conventional methods","generation of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibody clones","effectiveness of immunization strategies","desired epitope coverage profile","vaccine development","apparent binding affinities","development of effective vaccines","regard","foreign antigens","hydrogen deuterium exchange","desirable functional profiles","automated small scale purification system","determination","use of surface plasmon resonance","important tool","mass spectrometry","detailed assessments","nanogram","information","various immunized animals","resources","sophisticated evasion mechanisms of pathogens","recovery of serum","\u03BCl range","steps","selection","application"],"language":"en"},

Members of the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae are transmitted by mosquitos and ticks to humans and include highly pathogenic agents like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) as well as viruses that do not cause disease in humans, like Uukuniemi virus (UUKV). Phleboviruses and other bunyaviruses use their envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, for entry into target cells and for assembly of progeny particles in infected cells. Thus, binding of Gn and Gc to cell surface factors promotes viral attachment and uptake into cells and exposure to endosomal low pH induces Gc-driven fusion of the viral and the vesicle membranes. Moreover, Gn and Gc facilitate virion incorporation of the viral genome via their intracellular domains and Gn and Gc interactions allow the formation of a highly ordered glycoprotein lattice on the virion surface. Studies conducted in the last decade provided important insights into the configuration of phlebovirus Gn and Gc proteins in the viral membrane, the cellular factors used by phleboviruses for entry and the mechanisms employed by phlebovirus Gc proteins for membrane fusion. Here, we will review our knowledge on the glycoprotein biogenesis and the role of Gn and Gc proteins in the phlebovirus replication cycle.","publish_time":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spiegel, Martin; Plegge, Teresa; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/467143e07e3d6ec8a0617a5bdee446ab2c63581c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4974537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phlebovirus Gc proteins","Gc interactions","Gc-driven fusion","configuration of phlebovirus Gn","role of Gn","binding of Gn","viral genome","viral membrane","viral attachment","envelope proteins","Phlebovirus genus","target cells","Uukuniemi virus","infected cells","virion surface","entry","phlebovirus replication cycle","membrane fusion","humans","Bunyaviruses","Phleboviruses","Rift Valley fever virus","cell surface factors","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","severe fever","cellular factors","virion incorporation","glycoprotein biogenesis","enveloped viruses","tripartite RNA genome","ordered glycoprotein lattice","RVFV","exposure","endosomal low pH","uptake","pathogenic agents","assembly of progeny particles","formation","intracellular domains","serious threat","SFTSV","mechanisms","family Bunyaviridae","important insights","animal","human health","decade","mosquitos","ticks","disease"],"language":"en"},

Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection.

We categorized the time averaged-SUA (TA-SUA) into 5 groups: \u003C5.5, 5.5\u20136.4, 6.5\u20137.4, 7.5\u20138.4, and \u22658.5 mg/dL. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality according to SUA group. The mean TA-SUA level was slightly higher in men than in women. Patients with lower TA-SUA level tended to have lower body mass index (BMI), phosphorus, serum albumin level, higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (DM), and higher proportion of malnourishment on the subjective global assessment (SGA). During a median follow-up of 43.9 months, 206 patients died. Patients with the highest SUA had a similar risk to the middle 3 TA-SUA groups, but the lowest TA-SUA group had a significantly elevated HR for mortality.

In order to investigate the effect of signaling via Interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) in infectious neurological diseases, TMEV-infected SJL mice were treated with IL-10R blocking antibody (Ab) in the acute and chronic phase of the disease.

Ischaemic stroke pathophysiology has been shown to be influenced by components of the RAS with specific RAS receptor antagonists and agonists improving outcome in experimental models of stroke. Manipulation of the two opposing axes following acute ischaemic stroke may provide an opportunity for protection of the neurovascular unit, particularly in the presence of pre-existing co-morbidities where the balance may be shifted.

FmoPV has been isolated in several countries in Asia and Europe and is considered to have genetic diversity. Also, it is suspected to be associated with feline renal diseases including tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), which affects domestic cats with a high incidence rate. RESULTS: To clarify the state of FmoPV infection among domestic cats in Japan, an epidemiological survey was conducted. Twenty-one out of 100 cats were found to have serum antibodies (Ab) against FmoPV-N protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF) using FmoPV-N protein-expressing HeLa cells. Twenty-two of the cats were positive for FmoPV RNA in the urine and/or renal tissues. In total, 29 cats were positive for Ab and/or viral RNA. These FmoPV-infected cats were classified into three different phases of infection: RNA\u002B/Ab \u002B (14 cats), RNA\u002B/Ab- (8 cats) and RNA-/Ab \u002B (7 cats). In immunohistochemistry (IHC), 19 out of 29 cats were positive for FmoPV-N protein in kidney tissues; however, the FmoPV-N protein was located in the inflammatory lesions with severe grade in only four out of the 19 cats. Since 15 out of 29 infected cats were positive for viral RNA and Ab, approximately half of the infected cats were persistently infected with FmoPV. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant difference was observed between infection of FmoPV and the presence of inflammatory changes in renal lesions, indicating a relationship between FmoPV infection and feline renal diseases. However, we could not obtain histopathological evidence of a relationship between FmoPV infection and TIN.","publish_time":"2016-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Eun-Sil; Suzuki, Michio; Kimura, Masanobu; Mizutani, Hiroshi; Saito, Ryuichi; Kubota, Nami; Hasuike, Youko; Okajima, Jungo; Kasai, Hidemi; Sato, Yuko; Nakajima, Noriko; Maruyama, Keiji; Imaoka, Koichi; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27f21ae7789e41a6de01554cdae09cb93ef8524f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5057488.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA /Ab","RNA-/Ab","TIN"],"locations":["Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["FmoPV-infected cats","FmoPV RNA","infection of FmoPV","domestic cats","FmoPV-N protein","state of FmoPV infection","Ab","viral RNA","renal lesions","feline renal diseases","renal tissues","different phases of infection","relationship","inflammatory lesions","TIN","Feline morbillivirus","kidney tissues","presence of inflammatory changes","Japan","indirect immunofluorescence assay","tubulointerstitial nephritis","urine","half","novel paramyxovirus","high incidence rate","serum antibodies","significant difference","epidemiological survey","histopathological evidence","HeLa cells","Europe","severe grade","countries","BACKGROUND","Asia","CONCLUSIONS","total","genetic diversity","immunohistochemistry","IHC","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

There has been remarkable progress in dengue virus vaccine development; however, there are no licensed antivirals for dengue disease, and none appear to be in clinical trials. We took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds. We identified N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers. Dengue virus RNA levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells, and this effect was specific to dengue virus, as other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, or other RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, were not affected by these inhibitors. All three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) in the high-nanomolar range. Estimation of negative-strand RNA intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage, most probably at the initiation of viral RNA replication. Finally, we show that inhibition is most likely due to the modulation of the endolysosomal pathway and induction of autophagy.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.; Kumar, Rinki; Dhamija, Ekta; Agrawal, Tanvi; Kar, Meenakshi","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bf5ba8fe5af1bf36c9f2f3af74541fbda3a2c89.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5d445fbd8aa18aca2c2f7c947b25ddd62533f96b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5075077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue virus inhibitors","Dengue virus RNA levels","inhibited dengue virus replication","anti-dengue virus activity","dengue virus vaccine development","severe dengue disease","West Nile virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","respiratory syncytial virus","RNA viruses","initiation of viral RNA replication","strand RNA intermediates","inhibition","viral titers","numbers of infected cells","inhibitor-treated cells","salmeterol xinafoate","time","approach of repositioning approved drugs","reductions","fluoxetine hydrochloride","region","inhibitory concentrations","library","remarkable progress","effect","flaviviruses","Estimation of negative","modulation","endolysosomal pathway","year","thirds","induction of autophagy","N-desmethylclozapine","addition experiments","world population","rotavirus","licensed antivirals","high-nanomolar range","postentry stage","active compounds","people","clinical trials"],"language":"en"},

The most prevalent viral diseases in Norwegian salmon aquaculture are heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) caused by Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and pancreas disease (PD) caused by Salmonid alphavirus (SAV). Both PRV and SAV target heart and skeletal muscles, but SAV additionally targets exocrine pancreas. PRV and SAV are often present in the same locations and co-infections occur, but the effect of this crosstalk on disease development has not been investigated. In the present experiment, the effect of a primary PRV infection on subsequent SAV infection was studied. Atlantic salmon were infected with PRV by cohabitation, followed by addition of SAV shedder fish 4 or 10 weeks after the initial PRV infection. Histopathological evaluation, monitoring of viral RNA levels and host gene expression analysis were used to assess disease development. Significant reduction of SAV RNA levels and of PD specific histopathological changes were observed in the co-infected groups compared to fish infected by SAV only. A strong correlation was found between histopathological development and expression of disease related genes in heart. In conclusion, experimentally PRV infected salmon are less susceptible to secondary SAV infection and development of PD.

We have recently identified \u03B12,3-linked sialic acid on GD1a ganglioside as a functional SV-A receptor rich in the cells of pigs and chickens. However, the role of GD1a in viral pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that a Korean SV-A strain could induce diarrhoea and intestinal pathology in piglets but not in chicks. Moreover, this Korean SV-A strain had mild extra-intestinal tropisms appearing as mild, non-suppurative myelitis, encephalitis and pneumonia in piglets, but not in chicks. By real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR, higher viral RNA levels were detected in faecal samples than in sera or extra-intestinal organs from virus-inoculated piglets. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that high viral antigens were detected in the epithelial cells of intestines from virus-inoculated piglets but not from chicks. This Korean SV-A strain could bind the cultured cell lines originated from various species, but replication occurred only in cells of porcine origin. These data indicated that this Korean SV-A strain could replicate and induce pathology in piglets but not in chicks, suggesting that additional porcine-specific factors are required for virus entry and replication. In addition, this Korean SV-A strain is enteropathogenic, but could spread to the bloodstream from the gut and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs and tissues. These results will contribute to our understanding of SV-A pathogenesis so that efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs and vaccines could be developed in the future.","publish_time":"2016-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Deok-Song; Kang, Mun-Il; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Bak, Geon-Yong; Park, Jun-Gyu; Hosmillo, Myra; Seo, Ja-Young; Kim, Ji-Yun; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Lee, Ju-Hwan; Kwon, Joseph; Choi, Jong-Soon; Goodfellow, Ian; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af5f5cae93582ca713bbc2abaea17d7898b63f72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5078829.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5078829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Korean SV","strain","functional SV","understanding of SV","chicks","porcine sapelovirus","virus-inoculated piglets","extra-intestinal organs","intestinal pathology","mild extra-intestinal tropisms","viral pathogenesis","cells of pigs","cells of porcine origin","virus entry","pneumonia","new genus Sapelovirus","replication","efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs","high viral antigens","epithelial cells of intestines","higher viral RNA levels","GD1a ganglioside","role of GD1a","additional porcine-specific factors","PCR","RT","non-suppurative myelitis","faecal samples","encephalitis","sera","various species","vaccines","polioencephalomyelitis","cultured cell lines","receptor rich","member","diarrhoea","sialic acid","reproductive disorders","real-time reverse transcription","enteritis","gut","Immunohistochemistry","tissues","enteropathogenic","\u03B12","chickens","data","results","bloodstream","future"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and entry to the host cell is the first step of any virus infection. Commonly, viruses enter host cells by binding cell surface receptors. We adopt a computational modeling approach to study the evolution of the first infection step, where we consider two possible levels of resistance mechanism: at the level of the binding interaction between the host receptor and a virus binding protein, and at the level of receptor protein expression where we use a standard gene regulatory network model. At the population level we adopted the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. We used our multi-scale model to understand what conditions might determine the balance between use of resistance mechanisms at the two different levels. RESULTS: We explored a range of different conditions (model parameters) that affect host evolutionary dynamics and, in particular, the balance between the use of different resistance mechanisms. These conditions include the complexity of the receptor binding protein-protein interaction, selection pressure on the host population (pathogenicity), and the number of expressed cell-surface receptors. In particular, we found that as the receptor binding complexity (understood as the number of amino acids involved in the interaction between the virus entry protein and the host receptor) increases, viruses tend to become specialists and target one specific receptor. At the same time, on the host side, the potential for resistance shifts from the changes at the level of receptor binding (protein-protein) interaction towards changes at the level of gene regulation, suggesting a mechanism for increased biological complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Host resistance and viral pathogenicity depend on quite different evolutionary conditions. Viruses may evolve cell entry strategies that use small receptor binding regions, represented by low complexity binding in our model. Our modeling results suggest that if the virus adopts a strategy based on binding to low complexity sites on the host receptor, the host will select a defense strategy at the protein (receptor) level, rather than at the level of the regulatory network - a virus-host strategy that appears to have been selected most often in nature.

This study aims to clarify this question by studying the different induction of innate immune molecules by the distinct lung anatomic compartments (vascular, alveolar and bronchiolar) of ferrets intratracheally infected with a human pH1N1 viral isolate, by means of laser microdissection techniques. The obtained results were then analysed in relation to viral quantification in the different anatomic areas and the histopathological lesions observed. More severe lung lesions were observed at 24 h post infection (hpi) correlating with viral antigen detection in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells. However, high levels of viral RNA were detected in all anatomic compartments throughout infection. Bronchiolar areas were the first source of IFN-\u03B1 and most pro-inflammatory cytokines, through the activation of RIG-I.

Human CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 which have inhibitory ITIM/ITSM and activating ITAM-like motifs, respectively, in their cytoplasmic regions are such paired receptors. Various bacterial pathogens bind to CEACAM1 on epithelial and immune cells facilitating both entry into the host and down-regulation of the immune response whereas interaction with granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 leads to their uptake and destruction. It is unclear whether paired CEACAM receptors also exist in other vertebrate clades. RESULTS: We identified more than 80 ceacam genes in Xenopus tropicalis and X. laevis. They consist of two subgroups containing one or two putative paired receptor pairs each. Analysis of genomic sequences of paired receptors provide evidence that their highly similar ligand binding domains were adjusted by recent gene conversion events. In contrast, selection for diversification is observed among inhibitory receptor orthologs of the two frogs which split some 60 million years ago. The allotetraploid X. laevis arose later by hybridization of two closely related species. Interestingly, despite the conservation of the genomic landscape surrounding the homeologous ceacam loci only one locus resembles the one found in X. tropicalis. From the second X. laevis locus more than 80 % of the ceacam genes were lost including 5 of the 6 paired receptor genes. This suggests that once the gene for one of the paired receptors is lost the remaining gene cluster degrades rapidly probably due to lack of selection pressure exerted by pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of paired receptors and selection for diversification suggests that also in amphibians CEACAM1-related inhibitory proteins are or were used as pathogen receptors.

OBJECTIVE: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. RESULTS: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. LIMITATIONS: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.","publish_time":"2016-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koh, Wee Ming; Bogich, Tiffany; Siegel, Karen; Jin, Jing; Chong, Elizabeth Y.; Tan, Chong Yew; Chen, Mark IC; Horby, Peter; Cook, Alex R.","journal":"Pediatr Infect Dis J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1430ebabc4bb953366b635cd4a8adf9956c2f86b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5130063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5130063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD","EV-A71/Coxsackievirus"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of HFMD","incidence of HFMD","features of HFMD epidemiology","studies","EV-A71 vaccine","temperate Asia","subtropical Asia","symptomatic rate of EV","incubation period of EV","reviewers","Coxsackievirus A16 infection","CV-A16","STUDY SELECTION","results","widespread pediatric disease","Diversity of study designs","mouth disease","community-level","DATA SOURCES","temperate Japan","DATA EXTRACTION","Epidemiologic indices","pediatric vaccination schedules","specific research questions","school-level transmission","supporting quantitative evidence","hygiene","age","answers","prevalence","summer peak","attempts","Web of Science","predetermined inclusion","climatic role","serologic information","human enterovirus","PubMed","social contacts","gender","foot","peaks","systematic review","Hand","spring","exclusion criteria","incorporation","Google Scholar","Risk factors","estimates","use","CONTEXT","LIMITATIONS","basic reproduction number","relative importance","CONCLUSIONS","Knowledge","interventions","uncertainty","analysis","confounding variables","OBJECTIVE","gaps"],"language":"en"},

In an effort to support biochemical screening and drug design and discovery, we attempted to express and purify human AFP in a Bac-to-Bac system. Two key factors affecting the expression of recombinant human AFP (R-AFP), namely the infectious baculovirus inoculum volume and the culturing time post-infection, were optimized to maximize the yield. We achieved a high yield of approximately 1.5 mg/l of harvested medium with a 72\u201396 h incubation period after infection and an inoculum volume ratio of 1:100. We also assessed the role of R-AFP in the proliferation of the human liver cancer cell line Bel 7402, and the results indicated that R-AFP promoted the growth of hepatoma cells. We concluded that this method can produce high yields of R-AFP, which can be used for studies related to AFP.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Bo; Liu, Kun; Wang, Wenting; Li, Wei; Dong, Xu; Chen, Yi; Lu, Yan; Guo, Junli; Zhu, Mingyue; Li, Mengsen","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc43e3bf906ec492da56895a85e1a85d87bf59b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5240590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R-AFP","expression of recombinant human AFP","role of R","high yields of R","cancer treatment","inoculum volume ratio","infectious baculovirus inoculum volume","human liver cancer cell line Bel","immunomodulatory role","Bac system","growth of hepatoma cells","early serum growth factor","culturing time post-infection","foetal embryonic development","rheumatoid arthritis","multiple sclerosis","proliferation","myasthenia gravis","biochemical screening","drug design","hepatic oncogenesis","autoimmune diseases","h incubation period","discovery","thyroiditis","tumour-specific biomarker","results","important target","key factors","growing number of investigations","effort","method","\u03B1-fetoprotein","harvested medium","studies"],"language":"en"},

Several FDA-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of SERMs which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. SERMs reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry.

Here, we studied the structure of the 2H family member LigT from Escherichia coli both in the apo form and complexed with different active-site ligands, including ATP, 2\u2032-AMP, 3\u2032-AMP, phosphate, and NADP(\u002B). Comparisons to the well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) highlight specific features of the catalytic cycle and substrate recognition in both enzymes. The role played by the helix \u03B17, unique to CNPases within the 2H family, is apparently taken over by Arg130 in the bacterial enzyme. Other residues and loops lining the active site groove are likely to be important for RNA substrate binding. We visualized conformational changes related to ligand binding, as well as the position of the nucleophilic water molecule. We also present a low-resolution model of E. coli LigT bound to tRNA in solution, and provide a model for RNA binding by LigT, involving flexible loops lining the active site cavity. Taken together, our results both aid in understanding the common features of 2H family enzymes and help highlight the distinct features in the 2H family members, which must result in different reaction mechanisms. Unique aspects in different 2H family members can be observed in ligand recognition and binding, and in the coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule and the reactive phosphate moiety.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myllykoski, Matti; Kursula, Petri","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e08048659491371d0387ad99e9174a4c49c83872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5283653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5283653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H enzymes","H family enzymes","H family members","H phosphoesterase family","H family member LigT","active site groove","active site cavity","different active-site ligands","RNA binding","ligand binding","RNA substrate binding","coli LigT","common features","distinct features","specific features","nucleophilic water molecule","substrate recognition","ligand recognition","AMP","different reaction mechanisms","Escherichia coli","flexible loops","Unique aspects","low-resolution model of","bacterial enzyme","reactive phosphate moiety","well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme","conserved overall fold","little sequence identity","apo form","catalytic cycle","phosphodiesterase","Thr motifs","CNPases","help","kingdoms of life","Comparisons","helix \u03B17","X-Ser","physiological function","position","coordination","ATP","cyclic nucleotide","aid","tRNA","conformational changes","structure","residues","role","results","Arg130","NADP"],"language":"en"},

Serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D), a known biomarker of damaged alveolar epithelium, is also secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the possible association of SP-D with AKI susceptibility and prognosis. METHODS: In this study, 159 AKI patients and 120 healthy individuals were included. SP-D polymorphisms Thr11Met and Thr160Ala, AKI patient serum SP-D levels at days 1, 3 and 7 and urine KIM-1 levels in both AKI patients and controls were examined. The obtained results were correlated with the AKI stage, duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and prognosis. RESULTS: Serum SP-D level in AKI patients was higher than controls (p \u003C 0.01). SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype was more frequent in AKI patients than in controls (p \u003C 0.01). Furthermore, AKI patients with SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype had significantly higher serum SP-D levels (p \u003C 0.05) compared to other genotypes. Serum SP-D levels corrected to the progression of AKI with a peak at day 3. Furthermore, the SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype frequency and baseline serum SP-D level were higher in patients who subsequently died. Baseline serum SP-D levels positively correlated with the urine KIM-1 levels, AKI stage and RRT duration. CONCLUSION: In our study, elevated serum SP-D was associated with worse AKI clinical outcomes and patients with SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype were more susceptible to AKI. Collectively, these findings suggest that SP-D may be useful as a biomarker of AKI susceptibility and prognosis.","publish_time":"2017-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jiao; Li, Guang; Li, Lianghai; Liu, Zhiyong; Zhou, Qingshan; Wang, Guirong; Chen, Dechang","journal":"BMC Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83455a9888fe621fcdc0144f52ea9415491ded67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5316147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5316147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":["RRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AKI patients","AKI patient serum SP-D levels","elevated serum SP-D","higher serum SP-D levels","Baseline serum SP-D levels","SP-D polymorphisms Thr11Met","AKI stage","progression of AKI","Serum surfactant protein-D","biomarker of AKI susceptibility","possible association of SP","Thr genotype frequency","worse AKI clinical outcomes","study","controls","prognosis","RRT duration","urine KIM","kidney epithelial barrier","duration of renal replacement therapy","renal tubular epithelial cells","obtained results","characteristic feature of acute kidney injury","known biomarker of damaged alveolar epithelium","Thr160Ala","days","BACKGROUND","peak","healthy individuals","CONCLUSION","findings","aim","METHODS","genotypes"],"language":"en"},

However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Duch\u00EAne, Sebasti\u00E1n; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ac512d142c583daae040f2dc71312ea804b4f0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5319820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","virus families","virus-host co-divergence","host trees","virus evolution","host phylogenies","instances of host","host phylogenetic trees","cross-species transmission of viruses","indicative of frequent host","relative frequency of virus","frequent co-divergence","related viruses","RNA viruses","subset of viruses","evolutionary history of co-divergence","co-phylogenetic processes","overall high topological incongruence","high levels of topological incongruence","evidence of topological similarities","eukaryotic hosts","Polyomaviridae","Hepadnaviridae","major role","near universal feature","comparative estimate","double-stranded DNA genomes","greater propensity","Adenoviridae","Poxviridae","Papillomaviridae","Picornaviridae","increased sampling","potential","incongruent tree topologies","majority of emerging infections","Rhabdoviridae","analysis"],"language":"en"},

They are characterized by high mortality rates and are often caused by Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The increasing number of infections underlines the necessity for additional anti-fungal therapies, which require extended knowledge of gene regulations during fungal infection. MicroRNAs are regulators of important cellular processes, including the immune response. By analyzing their regulation and impact on target genes, novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches may be developed. Here, we examine the role of microRNAs in human dendritic cells during fungal infection. Dendritic cells represent the bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Therefore, analysis of gene regulation of dendritic cells is of particular significance. By applying next-generation sequencing of small RNAs, we quantify microRNA expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells after 6 and 12 h of infection with C. albicans and A. fumigatus as well as treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We identified 26 microRNAs that are differentially regulated after infection by the fungi or LPS. Three and five of them are specific for fungal infections after 6 and 12 h, respectively. We further validated interactions of miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p with immunological relevant target genes, such as FKBP1B, KLF4, and SPN, on both RNA and protein level. Our results indicate that these microRNAs fine-tune the expression of immune-related target genes during fungal infection. Beyond that, we identified previously undiscovered microRNAs. We validated three novel microRNAs via qRT-PCR. A comparison with known microRNAs revealed possible relations with the miR-378 family and miR-1260a/b for two of them, while the third one features a unique sequence with no resemblance to known microRNAs. In summary, this study analyzes the effect of known microRNAs in dendritic cells during fungal infections and proposes novel microRNAs that could be experimentally verified.","publish_time":"2017-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dix, Andreas; Czakai, Kristin; Leonhardt, Ines; Sch\u00E4ferhoff, Karin; Bonin, Michael; Guthke, Reinhard; Einsele, Hermann; Kurzai, Oliver; L\u00F6ffler, J\u00FCrgen; Linde, J\u00F6rg","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b87033ed15a4d9f337f37d67516b49992fd923c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5322194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aspergillus"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel microRNAs","role of microRNAs","undiscovered microRNAs","effect of known microRNAs","human dendritic cells","h of infection","incidence of invasive fungal infections","monocyte-derived dendritic cells","analysis of gene regulation of dendritic cells","additional anti-fungal therapies","expression of immune","related target genes","validated interactions of miR","immunological relevant target genes","immune response","increasing number of infections","LPS","adaptive immune systems","microRNA expression","Aspergillus fumigatus","Candida albicans","extended knowledge of gene regulations","necessity","possible relations","regulators of important cellular processes","FKBP1B","impact","diagnostic approaches","SPN","generation sequencing of small RNAs","study","comparison","bridge","particular significance","KLF4","treatment","lipopolysaccharides","decades","resemblance","family","qRT-PCR","protein level","unique sequence","high mortality rates","summary","fungi","results"],"language":"en"},

Unbiased proteomic discovery analysis identified 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins, and revealed that infection with H3N2 induces significant alterations in protein expression.

These data provide insights into the nature of the biological response to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, and the proteins that are dysregulated by viral infection form the basis of signature that accurately classifies the infected state. Verification of this signature using targeted mass spectrometry in independent cohorts of subjects challenged with influenza or rhinovirus demonstrates that it performs with high accuracy (0.8623 AUROC, 75% TPR, 97.46% TNR).

Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b) indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following: (1) Not incorporating indirect transmission route in the model leads to underestimation of the basic reproduction number, and hence will impact on the COVID-19 mitigation decisions; (2) Lockdown measures can suppress the primary infection peak, but will lead to a secondary peak whose relative strength and time of occurrence depend on the success and duration of the lockdown measures; (3) To make lockdown effective, a considerable level of reduction in both contact and non-contact transmission rates over a long period is required; (4) To bring down the infection cases below any hypothetical health-care capacity, reduction of non-contact transmission rate is key, and hence active measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission (e.g., extensive uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air); (5) Any premature withdrawal of lockdown following the sign of a brief retracement in the infection cases can backfire, and can lead to a quicker, sharper and higher secondary peak, due to reactivation of the two transmission routes. Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series data on infection cases and transmission rates.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Shovonlal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/538632fe0548a99c7db35480edcd74802237c1df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20050328","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission routes","route of transmission","non-contact transmission rates","level of transmission reduction","indirect transmission route","reduction of non-contact transmission rate","indirect non-contact transmission route needs","fomites-driven transmission","Lockdown measures","infection cases","distinct routes of COVID","lockdown effective","models of COVID","primary infection peak","unstoppable spread COVID","considerable level of reduction","premature withdrawal of lockdown","higher secondary peak","model simulations","active measures","following","uncertain level of relative contribution","health-service capacity","time of occurrence","hypothetical health-care capacity","relative strength","direct person","theoretical study","accurate time-series data","entire world of human population","public spaces","aerosol disinfectant","extensive uses of areal","classical epidemic modelling framework","sign","underestimation","success","reactivation","contaminated surfaces","brief retracement","long period","duration","evidences","account","basic reproduction number","mitigation decisions","air","countries","absolute scale","exit policy","coronavirus pandemic","classes","results"],"language":"en"},

Understanding its transmission characteristics including heterogeneity is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. In addition, transmission heterogeneity usually envokes super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases. Till now, studies of transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 and its underlying reason are far from reaching an agreement. MethodsWe collected information of all infected cases between January 21 and February 26, 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k which characterized the transmission potential and heterogeneity, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the SSE in Tianjin outbreak and evaluated the effect of control measures undertaken by local government based on the heterogeneous model. Results: A total of 135 confirmed cases (including 34 imported cases and 101 local infections) in Tianjin by February 26th 2020 entered the study. We grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of 4 generations. The estimated reproduction number R was at 0.67 (95%CI: 0.54[~]0.84), and the dispersion parameter k was at 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13[~]0.88). A super spreader causing six infections in Tianjin, was identified. In addition, our simulation results showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since January 28th. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that the transmission of COVID-19 was subcritical but with significant heterogeneity and may incur SSE. More efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors, which is important for developing targeted measures to curb the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Y.; Li, Y.; Wang, L.; Li, M.; Zhou, X.-H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37e0bc459b806e9752b00efa385d9ff6a8c27cc6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20073742v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSE"],"locations":["China","Tianjin"],"keyphrases":["transmission of COVID","studies of transmission heterogeneity of COVID","transmission characteristics","transmission chains","transmission potential","heterogeneous transmission model","significant heterogeneity","Tianjin outbreak","confirmed cases","imported cases","infected cases","local infections","local government","large numbers of secondary cases","effect of control measures","targeted measures","heterogeneous model","dispersion parameter","generations","addition","estimated reproduction number R","reproductive number R","super spreader","longest chain","largest chain","simulation results","envokes super spreading events","certain individuals","SSEs","branching process","prediction","vital importance","negative binomial offspring distribution","intervention of future epidemics","official public sources","rapid mass infection","contributing factors","populations","MethodsWe","information","metropolis of China","total","average","analysis","underlying reason","pandemic","Background","agreement","Conclusions","efforts","study"],"language":"en"},

Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.","publish_time":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibb, K.; Seeley, A.; Quinn, T.; Siddiqi, N.; Shenkin, S.; Rockwood, K.; Davis, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/19005165v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delirium diagnosis","reported delirium","prevalence of delirium","Introduction Delirium","studies","Overall delirium occurrence","temporal changes","true changes","evidence of increasing publication bias","meta-regression","clinical diagnosis","identical criteria","Random effects meta-analysis pooled estimates","adult medical patients","urgent priority","funnel plots","average age of sample","previous systematic review","wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes","proportion","general hospital","DSM","ICD","care pathways","dementia","incidence","hospitals","time","case-mix","healthcare complexity","Discussion","trends","decades","Methods"],"language":"en"},

In addition, most emergency measures such as border closings, cancellations of inbound flights, social distancing, and promotion of hand hygiene may not be as effective due to the clustered way people live in large as well as smaller population centers.

Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country\u0027s COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandoy, DJ Darwin R; Weimer, Bart C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0565d1bce8a2ea67608adee91eb894e86087457.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wallinga"],"organizations":["GENI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["dynamic R","genome sequencing","outbreak dynamic","outbreak metric","outbreak stages","increased genome variation","viral genome sequences","Instantaneous R estimates","early outbreak","outbreak status","evidence-based transmission metric","transmission time","instantaneous country-specific R","Initial R values","dynamic disease outbreak tracking","untraceable transmission","cryptic transmission","pathogen genome identity score","index stage","epicurve stage","exponential stages","limited number of cases","variable relationship","variable infection dynamics","predictive evidence","novel metric","China","different stages of outbreaks","takeoff","countries","Global spread of COVID","direct relationship viral genomic diversity","direct association","country\u0027s COVID","asymptomatic spread","Reproductive number","GENI scores","Initial comparisons","unprecedented infectious disease crisis","epidemic severity","Teunis method","local temperatures","standard serial interval","Wallinga","gaps","Population density","evolutionary rate","propagating epidemics","Integration of incidence data","mutations","month","Background","pandemic","decline","Findings","epidemiology","SARS-Cov","Methods","Interpretation","virus"],"language":"en"},

A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2).

Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ssebuufu, R.; Sikakulya, F.; Binezero, S.

If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay. Methods A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model - freely available - is applied to the COVID-19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated. Results Capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced five-fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay. Conclusions Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wood, R. M.; McWilliams, C.

Methods: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. Results: We identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juan, J.; Gil, M.

We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank. Methods UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. Interpretation These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

The death rate in Spain, for example, is greater than the death rate in Germany by more than a factor of ten. Few if any epidemiological indicators distinguish the countries of Europe by such a vast margin. Evidence on age-specific case-fatality rates (deaths over observed infections) and age-specific death rates (deaths over population) indicate that COVID-19 disproportionately afflicts the elderly and frail, suggesting that the share of elderly population (\u2265 65 years of age) in a country ought to be a strong predictor of the COVID-19 death rate. However, the COVID-19 death rate and the share of elderly population are statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.163, p = 0.399). Share of population \u2265 65 years of age is confounded by mortality selection, as well as other demographic dynamics. By contrast, elderly longevity or life expectancy at 65 more effectively captures population survival and the accumulation of age-related frailty in society. We find a strong statistical relationship between the COVID-19 death rate (r = 0.839, p \u003C .001) and elderly longevity, and a moderately strong relationship between the date of epidemic timing and elderly longevity (r = \u22120.634, p \u003C .001). These relationships are robust to the inclusion of statistical controls for international tourism inflow and hospital bed capacity. While the countries of Europe vary meaningfully in healthcare system capacity and in the timing and intensity of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the striking variation in COVID-19 death rates across these countries is statistically and intuitively associated with elderly survival and consequent frailty.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zahran, Sammy; Altringer, Levi; Prasad, Ashok","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/157fd9d1607747a37de884d760b57ca87e58e17c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Germany"],"keyphrases":["COVID","elderly longevity","share of elderly population","age-specific death rates","elderly survival","population survival","years of age","countries of Europe","age-specific case-fatality rates","strong statistical relationship","deaths","moderately strong relationship","strong predictor","consequent frailty","date of epidemic timing","inclusion of statistical controls","hospital bed capacity","healthcare system capacity","accumulation of age-related frailty","international tourism inflow","striking variation","observed infections","intensity of non-pharmaceutical interventions","example","life expectancy","contrast","country","Germany","Spain","society","mortality selection","Evidence","epidemiological indicators","vast margin","relationships","demographic dynamics","factor"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mengin, Amaury; Alle, M\u00E9lissa; Rolling, Julie; Ligier, Fabienne; Schroder, Carmen; Lalanne, Laurence; Berna, Fabrice; Jardri, Renaud; Vaiva, Guillaume; Geoffroy, Pierre A; Brunault, Paul; Thibaut, Florence; Chevance, Astrid; Giersch, Anne","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c09e5a6b8055faa6c35dc49691d6b4138294c03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300750; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300750?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of confinement","context of confinement","scale of confinement","known consequences of confinement","COVID","hallucinations","post-traumatic stress disorders","psychological effects of isolation","vast literature links social isolation","mechanisms of emergence","domestic violence","various symptoms","psychological problems","broad psychopathological consequences","depression","addictive behaviours","boredom","implications","place","polar expeditions","submarines","Anxiety","rapid development","sleep deprivation","vigilance","diagnostic","therapeutic approaches","telemedicine","prison","mind","regard","addition","published studies","reader of points","pandemic","crisis","management","interrelationships","example","distance"],"language":"en"},

Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ming; Wu, Qing; Xu, Wanzhou; Qiao, Bin; Wang, Jingwei; Zheng, Hongyun; Jiang, Shupeng; Mei, Junchi; Wu, Zegang; Deng, Yayun; Zhou, Fangyuan; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Yan; Lv, Zhihua; Huang, Jingtao; Guo, Xiaoqian; Feng, Lina; Xia, Zunen; Li, Di; Xu, Zhiliang; Liu, Tiangang; Zhang, Pingan; Tong, Yongqing; Li, Yan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV-positive","nCoV infected","nCoV-NP","nCoV infection","nCoV-infected patients","nCoV genome","positive rates of nCoV","nCoV nucleic acid test","positive target","nCovORF1ab-positive cases","influenza B virus","interpretation methods","co-infections","subjects","Clinical testing methods","multiple respiratory pathogens","respiratory syncytial virus","combined infections","pathogen infections","Novel coronavirus","rhinovirus","H3N2","multiple tests","clinical classification","negative results","hospital laboratories","close contacts","rapid screening","challenges","outbreaks","Chinese CDC","corresponding laboratory standards","quantitative PCR kit","Wuhan region","thousands of samples","isolation","fluorescence","cross-contamination","loci","Sample types","basis","treatment","diagnosis","metapneumovirus","fever","days","present study","Background","improvement","Findings","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. Methods: In this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI,1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI,0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student\u0027s anxiety levels increased with online learning. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saddik, B.; Hussein, A.; Sharif-Askari, F.

METHODS Laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported through the beginning of April were extracted from the Italian Civil Protection database. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into three periods: before February 21, from February 22 to early March, after early March. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and developed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. We explicitly took into account for unascertained cases (positive cases with no symptoms or mild symptoms that have not been accounted for in official statistics). RESULTS Currently, the number of positive active cases has increased to around 30,000 in the Lombardy region. Due to restriction measures, the effective reproduction number dropped from 3.33 (95% CI: 2.03-3.69) during the first period, to 2.36 (95% CI: 2.21-2.70) during the second period. In the third period, the effective reproduction number is estimated to have dropped to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.35-1.62). The model estimates a great proportion of unascertained cases, about 90% of infected people has not been accounted for in official statistics. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have slowed down the covid-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region. However, notwithstanding the long-lasting lockdown period, the epidemic is still not under control. The effective reproduction number, according to the model used in this work, is still greater than 1.0.

Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties. Methods Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care. Results Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Conclusions Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Branas, Charles C; Rundle, Andrew; Pei, Sen; Yang, Wan; Carr, Brendan G; Sims, Sarah; Zebrowski, Alexis; Doorley, Ronan; Schluger, Neil; Quinn, James W; Shaman, Jeffrey","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ef979dc430e365ca94b84ec62bf65b8e96c24f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Novel Coronavirus","ICU"],"locations":["United States","Colorado"],"keyphrases":["inaccessible critical care","Hospital critical care","critical care shortages","shortage of critical care beds","critical care bed limits","aggressive critical care surge response","potential critical care surge response","non-ICU critical care beds","medical system critical care supply","county-level critical care bed","US COVID","Estimates of COVID","excess deaths","high levels of COVID","ill COVID","current COVID","epidemic curve of COVID","high response scenario","low response scenario","spatio-temporal COVID","preventable deaths","urban counties","continental US counties","high total","Results Surge response scenarios","available beds","local estimates","high clearance of ICU","low total supply","various social distancing contact reduction assumptions","multiple patients","greater preventive actions","week study period","value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures","extraordinary measures","imposed contact precautions","non-urban areas","support value of preventive actions","disaster scenario","established disease modeling estimates","different estimated population levels","extended period of time","important medical system choke point","Multiple national public","greater availability of rapid testing","highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus","demand","preparations","terms","restrictions","growth","regions","self-isolation","New York","single ventilator","private datasets","infections","Colorado","Virginia","order","findings","similar interventions","United States","Methods","Conclusions","country","pandemic","ABSTRACT Background","world"],"language":"en"},

It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: University of Chicago Medicine Participants: Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3/3/2020-4/10/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol \u003C20ng/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol \u003C18pg/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient(last-level-deficient/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient/treatment-decreased). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Results: Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age\u003C50)=1.05,p\u003C0.021;RR(age[\u2265]50)=1.02,p\u003C0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p\u003C0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p\u003C0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meltzer, D. O.; Best, T.

Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P\u003C0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P\u003C0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P\u003E0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). Conclusions Among patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7.

Covid-19 infection has major international health and economic impacts and risk factors for infection are not completely understood. Cannabis smoking is linked with poor respiratory health, immunosuppression and multiple contaminants. Potential synergism between the two epidemics would represent a major public health convergence.

Cross-sectional state-based multivariable study. Setting. USA. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures. CVIR. Multivariable-adjusted geospatially-weighted regression models. As the American cannabis epidemic is characterized by a recent doubling of daily cannabis use it was considered important to characterize the contribution of high intensity use. Results. Significant associations of daily cannabis use quintile with CVIR were identified with the highest quintile having a prevalence ratio 5.11 (95%C.I. 4.90-5.33), an attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) 80.45% (79.61-81.25%) and an attributable fraction in the population of 77.80% (76.88-78.68%) with Chi-squared-for-trend (14,782, df=4) significant at P\u003C10-500. Similarly when cannabis legalization was considered decriminalization was associated with an elevated CVIR prevalence ratio 4.51 (95%C.I. 4.45-4.58), AFE 77.84% (77.50-78.17%) and Chi-squared-for-trend (56,679, df=2) significant at P\u003C10-500.

In interactive geospatial models adjusted for international travel, ethnicity, income, population, population density and drug use, terms including last month cannabis were significant from P=7.3x10-15, daily cannabis use from P=7.3x10-11 and last month cannabis was independently associated (P=0.0365). Conclusions and Relevance. Data indicate CVIR demonstrates significant trends across cannabis use intensity quintiles and with relaxed cannabis legislation. Recent cannabis use is independently predictive of CVIR in bivariate and multivariable adjusted models and intensity of use is interactively significant.

Then we present the individual based model (IMB) simulations to compare the result by deterministic approach and show the absolute difference between the estimated cumulative probability distribution computed by simulations and formula. We provide the predictions of the last day of epidemic for different fractions f of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griette, Quentin; Liu, Zhihua; magal, pierre","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f939f58248cd733ae2a90d5fa676604a099291d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064824","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["mainland China","simulations","COVID","formula","deterministic approach","estimated cumulative probability distribution","day of epidemic","date of end","extinction date","mathematical models","long time","reported data","different fractions f of asymptomatic infectious","continuous-time Markov processes","testing measures","absolute difference","strong quarantine","epidemics","IMB","reasonable bounds","individual based model","result","outbreak","predictions","main aim"],"language":"en"},

The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.

Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed, but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Methods: We tested an alternate approach (FACT) by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. This protocol was evaluated by serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes. The analytics validity of this concept was demonstrated in a five-sample mini pool set-up. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (five-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (ten-sample pools). Results: Serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes did not lead to a significant decline in viral concentration. The novel FACT-protocol did not cause a false negative result in a five-sample mini-pool setup, with non-significantly differing Ct values between single sample and mini-pool NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. Conclusions: Our proposed FACT- protocol did not cause a significant loss in analytic or diagnostic sensitivity compared to single sample testing in multiple setups. It reduced the amount of reagents needed by up to 40%, and also reduced hands-on time. This method could enhance testing efficiency, especially in groups with a low pretest-probability, such as systemically relevant professional groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmidt, M.; Hoehl, S.; Berger, A.; Zeichhardt, H.; Hourfar, K.; Ciesek, S.; Seifried, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/502a07aa4640266d17066eb92c79e6fdc79b923a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20074187v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sample pools","single sample testing","mini pools","sample mini-pool setup","sample mini pool set-up","proposed FACT- protocol","testing efficiency","novel FACT-protocol","single tube","multiple respiratory swabs","significant loss","loss of sensitivity","serial incubation","tubes","low-probability settings","low pretest-probability","pooling samples","diagnostic sensitivity","multiple setups","significant decline","Conserving reagents","positive patient samples","relevant professional groups","Ct values","nursing home","routine applications","SARS-CoV","pandemic","effectiveness of public health measures","symptomatic patients","false negative result","output of laboratories","asymptomatic residents","RT-PCR","viral concentration","alternate approach","Results","Conclusions","analytics validity","concept","pillars","Methods","Factors","Background","dilution","hands-on time","countermeasures"],"language":"en"},

As type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS. Methods: We performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent randomized INTEREST trial comparing IFN beta 1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity. Results: We found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta 1a was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-13.9, P\u003C 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung. This provides the mechanistic basis for the harmful association of glucocorticoids in IFN beta treated patients in the INTEREST-trial. Most importantly, it strongly speaks against the use of glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS such as in the currently expanding corona virus outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jalkanen, J.; Pettila, V.; Karvonen, M.; Huttunen, T.; Mandelin, J.; Jalkanen, M.; Malmberg, M.; Elima, K.; Bellingan, G.; Hollmen, M.; Ranieri, V.

However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing either via conventional methods or via mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of social distancing. It is therefore essential to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful. Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection, symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation. The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts with different delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings In the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%) the effective reproduction number will be reduced with 50% from 1.2 (with social distancing only) to 0.6 (Rcts) by contact tracing. A testing delay of 3 days requires tracing delay or coverage to be at most 1 day or at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1, with the Rcts reduction being 15% and 17%, respectively. With a testing delay of 4 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with declining coverage of app use, but app-based tracing remains more effective than conventional contact tracing even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depending on testing and tracing delay and isolation of index cases ranges from above 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 40% and 17% with testing delays of 3 and 5 days, respectively. Interpretation Minimizing testing delay is of key importance for the effectiveness of CTS. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology further enhances effectiveness of CTS, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. The process of conventional contact tracing should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for gaining speed in the process.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kretzschmar, M.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, Jamie A.; Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18f8f3db8bd033c86afc7f6b1a0df2a5638fe982.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.991083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRF activity","PRF signal","original SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV epidemic","inhibiting SARS-CoV","PRF attenuation element","Prior analyses of SARS","stemmed mRNA pseudoknot","molecular mechanism","COVID","virus replication","high rates","similar rates","current pandemic","Structural analyses","U UUA AAC slippery site","virus-specific targets","vaccine","silent coding mutations","small molecule interventions","best short term strategy","upstream attenuator hairpin","elements","core","lead compounds","world","comparative analysis","contrast","relative expression","frameshift signals","years","Functional assays","proteins","coronaviruses","optimistic projections","molecules"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p\u003C0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER\u002B) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Shitao; Lau, Alexandria; So, Hon-Cheong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b696d208705fcb1925693c5f0d118733bb557ea6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased ACE2 expression","altered ACE2 expression","high expression of ACE2","Expression data","current MR analysis","blood proteins","proteome-wide MR analysis","diseases","serum proteins","infection","diabetes-related traits","cytokine-cytokine","nominal significant associations","nCoV","T2DM","susceptibility","observational studies","drugs","type","receptor interaction","nominal level","lung cancers","drug candidates","drug repositioning","inflammatory bowel disease","phenome-wide Mendelian randomization","tentative causal association","asthma","study","light","smoking","VEGF","breast","enriched pathways","molecular mechanisms","exploratory nature","various limitations","multiple datasets","different analytic methods","consistent finding","major outbreaks","reverse causality","turn","elevated ALT","JAK-STAT","largest GWAS","better understanding","pathophysiology of COVID","parts","findings","number of plasma","treatments","good evidence","conclusion","beta","novel coronavirus","GSMR method","world","analyses","targets","future","GTEx"],"language":"en"},

The witness of these emergences have conducted health authorities to have policies and plans and to imagine new organizations for health systems in order to identify any case of highly communicable virulent disease for immediate isolation, and adequate management.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chidiac, C.; Ferry, T.","journal":"Transfusion Clinique et Biologique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc52edbe5fbd1811a453335e520b5aeacd47ee14.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1246782016300428; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1246782016300428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["their impact","their virulence","CoV","MERS","or their modality","their mortality","virus Ebola","Zika virus","maternofoetal transmission","modalit\u00E9s de transmission","transmission maternof\u0153tale","Ebola virus disease","H5N1","plans","conducted health authorities to","many emerging or re","highly communicable virulent disease","The witness","raison de la virulence","prise de conscience","health systems in order to identify any case","emerging infectious diseases","highly pathogenic avian influenza","nombreuses maladies infectieuses \u00E9mergentes","cas de maladie infectieuse \u00E9mergente","occurred over the past decade","some","new organizations","raised concerns because","isolement imm\u00E9diat","which","immediate isolation","these emergences","policies","grippe aviaire","soins de mani\u00E8re","Abstract Emergence","nouvelles organisations des syst\u00E8mes","major public threat","\u00E9mergences","charge ad\u00E9quate","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","probl\u00E8mes de sant\u00E9 publique majeurs","derni\u00E8res d\u00E9cennies","adequate management","autorit\u00E9s sanitaires","recommandations","mortalit\u00E9","SRAS"],"language":"fr"},

This paper sheds light on the position of Bangladesh in relation to its South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan with respect to testing capacity and ability to detect cases with increased testing. It also analyzes recent data on case counts and testing numbers in Bangladesh, to provide an idea regarding the number of extra tests needed to detect a substantial number of cases within a short period of time. Findings indicate that compared to India and Pakistan, Bangladesh was able to detect more cases by increasing testing levels and expand its testing capacity by performing more per capita tests. In spite of these achievements, the rate of reported cases per 100 tests was consistently higher for Bangladesh compared to India, which suggests that in addition to increased testing, other factors, such as, effective enforcement of social distancing and efficient contact tracing are just as important in curbing the spread of the disease. The analysis reveals that current testing levels in Bangladesh are not adequate. Based on the findings, we recommend a 30-50% growth of the current test rate in the next few days so that by detecting and isolating more cases, Bangladesh could, in effect, contain the spread of new infections. The challenge, however, is to mobilize resources necessary to expand geographical coverage and improve testing quality while enforcing social distancing and performing efficient contact tracing.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahaman Khan, H.; Howlader, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff76b5b7a368bc1204ef2fbac40a5b0cd6e81bb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.09.20096123v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["testing capacity","increased testing","testing quality","testing numbers","current testing levels","position of Bangladesh","rate of reported cases","substantial number of cases","confirmed cases of COVID","efficient contact tracing","Pakistan","number of extra tests","disease","Findings","current test rate","spread of new infections","effective enforcement of social distancing","South Asian neighbors India","relation","respect","geographical coverage","factors","ability","short period of time","achievements","idea","addition","order","efforts","paper sheds light","recent data","resources necessary","growth","analysis","days","spite","detection","country","challenge"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p\u003C0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p\u003C0.001).

Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shayak, B; Sharma, Mohit Manoj; Rand, Richard H; Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Misra, Anoop","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39037d14bf47bea9a4721c8f331da9661f18fef5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20047035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["limited-time lockdown","reported time-trajectories","time lag","time lapse","lockdown period","spread","reported case trajectories","reported case histories","actual histories","actual peak","reported figures","coronavirus disease","limited duration","lockdowns","days","account","delay","limited numbers of testing facilities","testing patients","latency period","peak values","mathematical model","model features","social reality","drastic social isolation measures","cases","significant disparity","view of practical considerations","transmission","midpoint","particular region","terms","absence","work","effective interval","true effectivity","COVID","symptoms","action"],"language":"en"},

By the first week of April, more than 900,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, although this number could be greatly underestimated. In the case of an epidemic emergency, the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of the miniPCR, a commercial compact and portable PCR device recently available on the market, and a commercial well-plate reader as a diagnostic system for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used the miniPCR to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using the sets of initiators recommended by the World Health Organization for targeting three different regions that encode for the N protein. Prior to amplification, samples were combined with a DNA intercalating reagent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye). Sample fluorescence after amplification was then read using a commercial 96-well plate reader. This straightforward method allows the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 x 105 DNA copies. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for COVID-19 pandemic testing, particularly in underdeveloped regions where RT-qPCR instrument availability may be limited. The portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for deployment in point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Everardo; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel; Lara-Mayorga, Itzel Montserrat; Martinez-Chapa, Sergio Omar; Alvarez, Mario Moises","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0530745a1b48b0a45d93155f9878f561ce5778e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052860","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","EvaGreen Dye"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amplification of SARS","care SARS-CoV","miniPCR","reliable alternative","commercial well-plate reader","DNA sequences","nucleic acids","DNA copies","combined use","DNA intercalating reagent","positive cases of COVID","underdeveloped regions","different regions","detection efforts","pandemic testing","diagnostics strategy","rapid diagnostics","ease of use","diagnostic system","portable PCR device","market","World Health Organization","sets of initiators","point","RT-qPCR instrument availability","deployment","epidemic emergency","EvaGreen Dye","value of massive","line of response","accuracy","simplicity","reproducibility","straightforward method","pandemics","samples","N protein","validated resources","portability","Sample fluorescence","range","week","number"],"language":"en"},

Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training.

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iravani, B.; Arshamian, A.; Ravia, A.; Mishor, E.; Snitz, K.; Shushan, S.; Roth, Y.; Perl, O.; Honigstein, D.; Weissgross, R.; Karagach, S.; Ernst, G.; Okamoto, M.; Mainen, Z.; Monteleone, E.; Dinnella, C.; Spinelli, S.; Marino-Sanchez, F.; Ferdenzi, C.; Smeets, M.; Touhara, K.; Bensafi, M.; Hummel, T.; Sobel, N.; Lundstrom, J.

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. Methods: We prospectively collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data on critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed-COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in northern Manhattan between March 2nd and April 1st, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal-replacement-therapy, and time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission. The relationship between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modeled using Cox-proportional-hazards regression. Each patient had at least 14 days of observation. Results: Of 1,150 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 51-72); 170 (66%) were male. Two-hundred twelve (82%) had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (63%; 162/257) and diabetes mellitus (36%; 92/257). One-hundred-thirty-eight patients (54%) were obese, and 13 (5%) were healthcare workers. As of April 14th, 2020, in-hospital mortality was 33% (86/257); 47% (122/257) of patients remained hospitalized. Two-hundred-one (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (median 13 days [IQR 9-17]), and 54% (138/257) and 29% (75/257) required vasopressors and renal-replacement-therapy, respectively. The median time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission was 3 days (IQR 1-6). Older age, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and higher concentrations of interleukin-6 and d-dimer at admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Critical illness among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, M.

These disparate effects elicited by O3 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied. Despite the apparent contradictions, a general pattern of response to O3 exposure can be recognized. Most studies indicate that continuous O3 exposure leads to an early (days 0-3) impairment of immune responsiveness followed, with continued exposures, by a form of adaptation to O3 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response. The effects of O3 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which O3 exposure occurred. Whereas O3 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, O3 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen. Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that O3 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity.","publish_time":"1995-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jakab, G J; Spannhake, E W; Canning, B J; Kleeberger, S R; Gilmour, M I","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52ad224b03765bb748a346a5d0586beef490a490.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1518840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of O3 exposure","O3 exposure subsequent","continuous O3 exposure","immune responses","immune parameters","impairment of immune responsiveness","general pattern of response","immunization","profound effects","disparate effects","studies","numerous investigators","anatomical evidence","lung","hypothesis","continued exposures","antigenic stimulation","experimental design","ozone","time","apparent contradictions","form of adaptation","systemic immunity","days","literature","re-establishment","review","animal species"],"language":"en"},

The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene, a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical, and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a full-length cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy.

To study the biological properties of the cells involved in this repair process, glial cells were isolated and cultured from spinal cords of these young adult mice during demyelination and remyelination. Using three-color immunofluorescence combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, we have analyzed the antigenic phenotype and mitotic potential of individual glial cells. We identified oligodendrocytes with an antibody to galactocerebroside, astrocytes with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein, and oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells with the O4 antibody. Cultures from demyelinated tissue differed in several ways from those of age-matched controls: first, the total number of O-2A lineage cells was strikingly increased; second, the O-2A population consisted of a higher proportion of O4-positive astrocytes and cells of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype; and third, all the cell types within the O-2A lineage showed enhanced proliferation. This proliferation was not further enhanced by adding PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the defined medium. However, bFGF and IGF-I seemed to influence the fate of O-2A lineage cells in cultures of demyelinated tissue. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of cells expressing galactocerebroside. In contrast, IGF-I increased the relative proportion of oligodendrocytes. Thus, O-2A lineage cells from adult mice display greater phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential in response to an episode of demyelination. These properties may be linked to the efficient remyelination achieved in this demyelinating disease.","publish_time":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63aed9fa99e7df7846c24993fbf4d7aebb4d957a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2116277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lineage cells","percentage of cells","progenitor cells","fate of O","mitotic potential of individual glial cells","cells of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype","IGF","total number of O","O4 antibody","enhanced proliferation","young adult mice","N mice","efficient remyelination","cultures of demyelinated tissue","bFGF","galactocerebroside","demyelinating disease","basic fibroblast growth factor","higher proportion of O4","relative proportion of oligodendrocytes","positive astrocytes","oligodendrocyte-type","glial fibrillary acidic protein","repair process","efficient CNS myelin repair","antigenic phenotype","Basic FGF","episode of demyelination","biological properties","coronavirus","greater phenotypic plasticity","functional recovery","murine hepatitis virus strain A59","intracranial injection","spinal cords","response","C57B1","ways","PDGF","insulin","age-matched controls","population","thymidine autoradiography","three-color immunofluorescence","cell types","defined medium","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Similar to previous observations (Balch et al. 1994. Cell. 76:841-852), VSV-G was concentrated nearly 5-10-fold in vesicular carriers that accumulate in the presence of the rab1a(N124I) mutant.

A series of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged fusion proteins was constructed in which invertase is appended to the Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Och1p. Several constructs included a Kex2p cleavage site between the Och1p and invertase moieties to monitor transit to the Kex2p-containing TGN. Cells expressing an Och1p-invertase fusion do not secrete invertase, but those expressing an Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein secrete high levels of invertase in a Kex2p-dependent manner. The Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein is cleaved with a half-time of 5 min, and the process proceeds to completion. Before cleavage the protein receives glycosyl modifications indicative of passage through the medial- and trans-Golgi, therefore cleavage occurs after ordered anterograde transport through the Golgi to the TGN. Transit to distal compartments is not induced by the invertase moiety, since noninvertase fusion constructs encounter the same glycosyltransferases and Kex2p as well. The Och1p-HA moiety, irrespective of whether it is generated by cleavage of the fusion protein in the TGN or synthesized de novo, is degraded with a half-time of about 60 min. Thus, the half-time of degradation is 12-fold longer than the time required to reach the TGN. At steady state, de novo- synthesized and TGN-generated HA epitope-tagged Och1p reside in a compartment with a buoyant density identical to that of wild-type Och1p and distinct from that of the vacuole or the TGN. Finally, och1 null cells that express an Ochlp fusion construct known to rapidly encounter the TGN glycosylate invertase to the same extent as wild-type cells, indicating that they have phenotypically wild-type Och1p activity. These results lead us to propose a model for Och1p-HA localization that involves movement to distal compartments, at least as far as the TGN, followed by retrieval to the cis compartment, presumably by vesicular transport.","publish_time":"1996-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfaf24a34273d866bfa8ca32accf91d6a928c163.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Och1p-invertase fusion","Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein","Och1p-HA localization","Och1p-HA moiety","invertase moiety","invertase moieties","wild-type Och1p activity","Kex2p cleavage site","fusion proteins","TGN-generated HA epitope","high levels of invertase","noninvertase fusion constructs","Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Och1p","Ochlp fusion construct","trans-Golgi","wild-type cells","cis-Golgi mannosyltransferase","Kex2p-dependent manner","mechanism of integral membrane protein localization","cis compartment","transit","distal compartments","novo","half-time of degradation","early Golgi apparatus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae","och1 null cells","vesicular transport","anterograde transport","glycosyl modifications indicative of passage","movement","series of influenza virus hemagglutinin","extent","buoyant density identical","model","glycosyltransferases","fold","retrieval","process proceeds","completion","steady state","vacuole","results"],"language":"en"},

The ontogeny of resistance to hepatitis in the C(3)H mice thus progresses from delayed susceptibility to complete resistance as the age of the host increases. It is reflected in increased resistance of macrophages derived in vitro from liver cultures of infant mice of different ages.

Five anchor residues were identified in this study by measuring the peptide-binding affinities of substituted Qdm peptides in experiments with purified recombinant Qa-1(b). A candidate peptide-binding motif was determined by sequence analysis of peptides eluted from Qa-1 that had been folded in the presence of random peptide libraries or pools of Qdm derivatives randomized at specific anchor positions. The results indicate that Qa-1(b) can bind a diverse repertoire of peptides but that Qdm has an optimal primary structure for binding Qa-1(b). Flow cytometry experiments with Qa-1(b) tetramers and NK target cell lysis assays demonstrated that CD94/NKG2A discriminates between Qa-1(b) complexes containing peptides with substitutions at nonanchor positions P4, P5, or P8.

To address this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as self in oligodendrocytes. Intraperitoneal infection with LCMV strain Armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and the virus was cleared within 7\u201314 d. After clearance, a chronic inflammation of the CNS resulted, accompanied by upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and II molecules. A second LCMV infection led to enhanced CNS pathology, characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction. Disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated LCMV-specific memory T cells. These findings indicate that chronic CNS autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus.

No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain did not affect the protein\u0027s transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the yeast Golgi apparatus. The 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocalization to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocalization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked sec1 mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. These data are consistent with a model in which membrane proteins are delivered to the vacuole along a default pathway.","publish_time":"1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8894efb9895e24c82697cf864b69e9a2eb0751c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPAP","DPAP A.

Birds are the reservoir for all known influenza A subtypes; and novel influenza viruses can emerge from birds and infect mammalian species including humans. Because swine are susceptible to infection with both avian and human influenza viruses, novel reassortant influenza viruses can be generated in this mammalian species by reassortment of influenza viral segments leading to the \u201Cmixing vessel\u201D theory. There is no direct evidence that the reassortment events culminating in the 1918, 1957 or 1968 pandemic influenza viruses originated from pigs. Genetic reassortment among avian, human and/or swine influenza virus gene segments has occurred in pigs and some novel reassortant swine viruses have been transmitted to humans. Notably, novel reassortant H2N3 influenza viruses isolated from the US pigs, most likely infected with avian influenza viruses through surface water collected in ponds for cleaning barns and watering animals, had a similar genetic make-up to early isolates (1957) of the H2N2 human pandemic. These novel H2N3 swine viruses were able to cause disease in swine and mice and were infectious and highly transmissible in swine and ferrets without prior adaptation. The preceding example shows that pigs could transmit novel viruses from an avian reservoir to other mammalian species. Importantly, H2 viruses pose a substantial risk to humans because they have been absent from mammalian species since 1968 and people born after 1968 have little preexisting immunity to the H2 subtype. It is difficult to predict which virus will cause the next human pandemic and when that pandemic might begin. Importantly, the establishment and spread of a reassorted mammalian-adapted virus from pigs to humans could happen anywhere in the world. Therefore, both human and veterinary research needs to give more attention to potential cross-species transmission capacity of influenza A viruses.","publish_time":"2008-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Wenjun; Kahn, Robert E; Richt, Juergen A","journal":"J Mol Genet Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4be09649912765a96eb17e54d40b4b777b3413c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2702078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel influenza viruses","human influenza viruses","avian influenza viruses","novel viruses","pandemic influenza viruses","novel reassortant influenza viruses","H2 viruses","novel reassortant H2N3 influenza viruses","novel reassortant swine viruses","novel H2N3 swine viruses","known influenza","mammalian species","swine influenza virus gene segments","reassortment of influenza viral segments","humans","potential cross-species transmission capacity of influenza","H2N2 human pandemic","avian reservoir","US pigs","reassorted mammalian-adapted virus","Genetic reassortment","Birds","reassortment events","H2 subtype","similar genetic make-up","infectious respiratory pathogens","ponds","watering animals","surface water","attention","cleaning barns","subtypes","disease","infection","early isolates","ferrets","mice","substantial risk","preexisting immunity","mixing vessel","prior adaptation","direct evidence","veterinary research","people","preceding example","theory","establishment","world"],"language":"en"},

Novel approaches to blocking the oligomerization of viral enzymes and the interactions between viral proteins and host cell factors, including their feasibility as drug targets, are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wapling, Johanna; Srivastava, Seema; Shehu-Xhilaga, Miranda; Tachedjian, Gilda","journal":"Drug Target Insights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3042820ac417ec01ca0e15a4232e24b8d78ba74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3155237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","viral polyproteins","viral assembly","new drug targets","drug toxicity","blocking HIV","oligomerization of viral enzymes","viral reverse transcriptase","virus life-cycle","late stages of virus replication","host cell factors","eventual emergence of drug resistant strains","treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type","novel mechanisms","licensed drugs","approved drugs","Novel approaches","interactions","infections","synthesis","trafficking","RT","agents","maturation","feasibility","protease","gp41 transmembrane protein","increased understanding","inhibitors","budding","review"],"language":"en"},

However, most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary. Here, we evaluate the potential of a recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization. Hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence (57.9%) or partial development (21%) of ALA, resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups. In contrast, nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy. Levels of ALA protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens, but not with the induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies. These results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of E. histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization, and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meneses-Ruiz, DM; Laclette, JP; Aguilar-D\u00EDaz, H; Hern\u00E1ndez-Ruiz, J; Luz-Madrigal, A; Sampieri, A; Vaca, L; Carrero, JC","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2def385170922c5786ea00a64f0c139460d23e2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3221370.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral immunization","anti-amoebic vaccine","Levels of ALA protection","mucosal delivery","protection efficacy","nasal immunization","anti-amoebic cellular immune response","expression of","Gal-lectin","hamsters","oral route","mucosal adjuvants","Mucosal vaccination","wild type baculovirus","amoebic liver abscess","histolytica vaccine candidate antigens","recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus","partial development","humoral immune responses","induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies","identification of safe delivery systems","lineal correlation","sham control groups","spleens","LC3 fragment","potential","complete absence","amoebiasis","leading strategies","human disease","animals","contrast","results"],"language":"en"},

Life expectancy soared by around 30 years, infant mortality plummeted and smallpox, sexually transmitted diseases and many other infections were either eliminated or decreased massively in incidence, largely as a result of CDC. By the mid-1970s, China was already undergoing the epidemiologic transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status. These early successes can be attributed to population mobilization, mass campaigns and a focus on sanitation, hygiene, clean water and clean delivery, and occurred despite political instability and slow economic progress. The 10-year Cultural Revolution from 1966 brought many hardships, but also clinical care and continuing public health programs to the masses through community-funded medical schemes and the establishment of community-based health workers. These people-focused approaches broke down with China\u2019s market reforms from 1980. Village doctors turned to private practice as community funding ceased, and the attention paid to rural public health declined. CDC relied on vertical programs, some of them successful (such as elimination of lymphatic filariasis and child immunisation), but others (such as control of schistosomiasis and tuberculosis) demonstrating only intermittent progress due to failed strategies or reliance on support by the poorest governments and health workers, who could not or would not collaborate. In addition, China\u2019s laissez-faire approach to public health placed it at great risk, as evidenced by the outbreak in 2003 of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Since then, major changes to disease reporting, the priority given to CDC including through major new domestic resources and reform of China\u2019s health system offer encouragement for CDC. While decentralized funding and varying quality diagnosis, reporting and treatment of infectious diseases remain major challenges, national priority on CDC in China is high.","publish_time":"2011-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hipgrave, David","journal":"J Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02fe68e2ba45e7f0c6f746d4b3db36f8f99ae4f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3484775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3484775/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["public health programs","China\u2019s progress","result of CDC","rural public health","reform of China\u2019s health system","based health workers","years","establishment of community","community funding","major challenges","China\u2019s laissez-faire approach","major changes","intermittent progress","China\u2019s market reforms","slow economic progress","disease reporting","communicable disease control","national priority","major new domestic resources","clean delivery","clean water","transmitted diseases","decentralized funding","vertical programs","control of schistosomiasis","treatment of infectious diseases","nations of similar economic status","sanitation","reliance","hygiene","support","masses","political instability","varying quality diagnosis","population mobilization","mass campaigns","failed strategies","smallpox","private practice","poorest governments","medical schemes","clinical care","attention","encouragement","elimination of lymphatic filariasis","child immunisation","hardships","tuberculosis","addition","people-focused approaches","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Village doctors","infant mortality","epidemiologic transition","great risk","outbreak","People\u2019s Republic","year Cultural Revolution","early successes","infections","Life expectancy","incidence"],"language":"en"},

The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.","publish_time":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Haiqing; Wang, Jizhen; Manicassamy, Balaji; Manicassamy, Santhakumar; Caffrey, Michael; Rong, Lijun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GP expression","ability of GP","synthesized GP gene","GP-mediated Ebola entry","synthetic GP gene","charged residues of GP2","length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species","entry mechanism of Ebola viruses","membrane fusion","GP2 helical regions","efficient viral infection","viral incorporation","viral envelope","efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system","important role","host cells","mammalian cells","multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction","safe approach","overlapping oligonucleotides","spikes","base pairs","receptor binding","mutational analysis","sole structural protein","PCR","processing","disulfide bond","intermediate conformation","subunits","GP1","mutations","study","substitutions","results","glycoprotein"],"language":"en"},

We report here that DPP-IV cleaves the first two amino acids from insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), revealed by mass spectrometry. The kinetic parameters of the proteolytic cleavage indicate that this reaction is physiologically relevant. Interestingly, truncated IGF-1 is less potent than the full-length protein in activating the IGF-1R, but binds more readily to IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Quantitative RT\u2013PCR showed that the level of DPP-IV mRNA is dramatically lower in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues than in adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues. However, this reduction was not observed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Our study suggests a possible link between IGF-1 and DPP-IV in cancer development in a specific tumor niche. A DPP-IV-related pathway may be important in mitigating IGF-1 signaling.

In the recent past, India has seen outbreaks of eight organisms of emerging and re-emerging diseases in various parts of the country, six of these are of zoonotic origin. Prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases will increasingly require the application of sophisticated epidemiologic and molecular biologic technologies, changes in human behaviour, a national policy on early detection of and rapid response to emerging infections and a plan of action. WHO has made several recommendations for national response mechanisms. Many of these are in various stages of implementation in India. However, for a country of size and population of India, the emerging infections remain a real and present danger. A meaningful response must approach the problem at the systems level.

Bats are the natural reservoir hosts for a number of emerging zoonotic diseases. Attempts to isolate bat-borne viruses in various terrestrial mammalian cell lines have sometimes been unsuccessful. The bat cell lines are useful in isolation and propagation of many of the viruses harboured by bats. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help such investigations and to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. In this study we made an attempt to develop a cell line from P. ceylonicus bats. METHODS: An effort was made to establish cell line from embryo of P. ceylonicus species of bat after seeding to Dulbecco\u0027s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 per cent foetal bovine serum; a primary cell line was established and designated as NIV-BtEPC. Mitochondrial DNA profile analysis was done using cyt-b and ND-1 gene sequences from the cell line. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining algorithm for cyt-b and ND-1 genes with 1000-bootstrap replicates. RESULTS: NIV-BtEPC cell line was susceptible to Chandipura (CHPV) and novel adenovirus (BtAdv-RLM) isolated from Rousettus leschenaulti from India but did not support multiplication of a number of Bunyaviruses, Alphaviruses and Flavivirus. This might be useful for isolation of a range of viruses and investigation of unknown aetiological agents. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a new bat cell line was developed from P. ceylonicus. This cell line was successfully tested for the susceptibility to Chandipura and BtAdv-RLM virus isolated from bats. The approach developed and optimised in this study may be applicable to the other species of bats and this established cell line can be used to facilitate virus isolation and basic research into virus-host interaction.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mourya, Devendra T.; Lakra, Rajen J.; Yadav, Pragya D.; Tyagi, Preeti; Raut, Chandrashekhar G.; Shete, Anita M.; Singh, Dinesh K.","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3788208.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3788208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Asia","China","Southeast Asia","India"],"keyphrases":["new bat cell line","established cell line","primary cell line","NIV-BtEPC cell line","New stable bat cell lines","ceylonicus species of bat","ceylonicus bats","study of bat immunology","species of bats","Pipistrellus ceylonicus bat species","virus isolation","various terrestrial mammalian cell lines","BtAdv-RLM virus","virus-host interactions","Chandipura","range of viruses","cyt-b","number of Bunyaviruses","South Asia","Southeast Asia","number of emerging zoonotic diseases","CHPV","basic research","additional populations","cent foetal bovine serum","DMEM","Dulbecco\u0027s modified eagle medium","novel adenovirus","natural reservoir hosts","OBJECTIVES","gene sequences","embryo of","investigation of unknown aetiological agents","neighbour","Mitochondrial DNA profile analysis","China","genes","algorithm","BACKGROUND","susceptibility","propagation","RESULTS","Rousettus leschenaulti","India","multiplication","Alphaviruses","Flavivirus","effort","attempt","Phylogenetic tree","bootstrap replicates","INTERPRETATION","CONCLUSIONS","investigations","METHODS","approach"],"language":"en"},

However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). Methods Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was optimized to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. DBS samples were eluted overnight and transferred to a 96-well plate coated with antigen, and anti-human IgG-HRP was used to generate signal in proportion to bound antibody. DBS samples spiked with anti-SARS IgG antibody, and samples from known positive and negative cases, were compared to evaluate assay performance. Results Analysis of samples with known concentrations of anti-SARS IgG produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Optical density (OD) values were significantly elevated for known positive cases in comparison with samples from unexposed individuals. Discussion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection that combines the convenience of sample collection in the home or non-clinical setting with the accuracy of ELISA in the lab.

Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. Aim and methods We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. Results We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; del Pozo Carlavilla, Mar\u00EDa; Valerio Alonso, Maria Eli; Dom\u00EDnguez Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; Ten Bosch van der Werff, J.; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Juh Yeoh, Allen Eng; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Marisa; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1532f63a9a38d108746ba7a374ed1987c9f8d952.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920301623; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920301623?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe course of COVID","asymptomatic course of COVID","beginning of COVID","immunocompromised children","anticancer treatment","treatment options","oncological treatment","flash survey","need of intensive treatment","mild disease","elderly","risk","intensity of preventive measures","short web based survey","uneven age distribution","severity","Wuhan","China","COVID19 incidence","delays","anti-cancer chemotherapy","possible explanation","anecdotal information","hypertension","obstructions","dismal outcome","email","Comorbidities","particular diabetes","line","smoke","young adults","Abstract Introduction","cases","countries","patients","weaker immunity","obesity","methods","place","Conclusion","pandemics","reports","leukemia","Respondents","time"],"language":"en"},

Two in-house ELISA assays, that recognize the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric Spike (S) ectodomain were implemented. We also developed two novel assays: the S-Flow assay, which is based on the recognition of S at the cell surface by flow-cytometry, and the LIPS assay that recognizes diverse antigens (including S1 or N C- terminal domain) by immunoprecipitation. Overall, the results obtained with the four assays were similar, with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use. High antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity, assessed using infectious SARS-CoV- 2 or lentiviral-S pseudotypes. In hospitalized patients, seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of COVID cases.

This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the characteristics of COVID-19 positive women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based on the information provided by their health professionals. Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodrigues, C.; Baia, I.; Domingues, R.; Barros, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c6064a5527ae67861090d6d2c6b074cb37382b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20079509v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Portugal","China"],"keyphrases":["impact of COVID","severe COVID","effect of COVID","characteristics of COVID","positive women","outcome of published cases of pregnant women","Portuguese cases","original published studies","original studies","newborns","cases of maternal death","SARS-CoV","identified studies","evidence of SARS","published deliveries","pregnancy","Portugal","Portuguese maternities","study quality","live births","Preterm births","neonatal death","study reviews knowledge","required admission","intensive care unit","emerging concern","potential adverse effects","placenta","prevention","gestational age","information","high levels of IgM antibodies","mothers","stillbirth","pandemic","assumptions","vulnerable populations","contact","cord blood","PRISMA standards","date","language restrictions","Breast milk samples","amniotic fluid","management strategies","virus","Methods","Searches","PubMed","health professionals","China","infants","Background","Results","countries","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

These data suggest that differences in ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin epithelial and airway gene expression are unlikely to confer enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia risk in patients with asthma across all treatment intensities and severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradding, Peter; Richardson, Matthew; Hinks, Timothy S.C.; Howarth, Peter H.; Choy, David F.; Arron, Joseph R.; Wenzel, Sally E.; Siddiqui, Salman","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3302a0be252e0ed858742bd6d5a65ce6ca04822.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920307302; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920307302?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dependent gene expression","airway gene expression","asthma severity","dependent gene signatures","ACE2 receptor mRNA expression","IL","TMPRSS2","furin epithelial","Th2-cytokine","risk factor","inverse correlation","pneumonia risk","enhanced COVID","positive correlation","severe COVID","treatment intensities","co-factors","people","biopsies","clinical demographics","patients","bronchial brushes","inhaled steroids","Sars-CoV","relationships","healthy controls","research participants","age","infectivity","differences","significant association","described studies","sex","disease","clear signal","cohort"],"language":"en"},

Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been described in 14% of the reported cases. Several therapeutic approaches are under investigation but safety and potential efficacy remain to be determined. Chest irradiation at equivalent doses below 1 Gy has been used successfully in the past to treat pneumonia. However, after the onset of effective antimicrobial agents, the use of low doses in the treatment of patients has been discontinued and the involved mechanism remained unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which low doses of radiation therapy (RT) protect the lung from inflammation. Nerve- and airway-associated macrophages (NAMs) and the pro-versus anti-inflammatory cytokine balance (IL6-IFN\u03B3/IL-10) were recently shown to regulate lung inflammation. Here, we used Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)] and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human lung macrophages and murine model of lung inflammation for functional assays. Our results show that irradiation of Poly(I:C)-stimulated human lung macrophages in vitro using low doses of RT (0.5-1 Gy) increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFN\u03B3 production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased in vitro with low doses of RT. Furthermore, using experimental models (LPS- and Poly(I :C)-induced lung inflammation), we showed that chest irradiation using low doses of RT significantly increased the percentage of NAMs producing IL-10, leading to lung protection from inflammation. Altogether, our data highlight one of the mechanisms by which low doses of RT regulate lung inflammation and positively favor anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion by lung macrophages. These data strongly suggest that low doses of RT could be used in order to mitigate lung inflammatory processes in situations such as COVID-19-induced ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meziani, Lydia; Robert, Charlotte; Mordant, Pierre; Deutsch, Eric","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.077651","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low doses of RT","induced lung inflammation","lung protection","use of low doses","percentage of human lung macrophages","stimulated human lung macrophages","murine model of lung inflammation","lung inflammatory processes","equivalent doses","low doses of radiation therapy","irradiation of Poly","Chest irradiation","anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion","airway-associated macrophages","anti-inflammatory cytokine balance","cytokine storm syndrome","severe COVID","LPS","percentage of NAMs","Severe pneumonia","Gy","induced ARDS","decreased IFN\u03B3 production","IL6-IFN\u03B3","treatment of patients","involved mechanism","data highlight","marked inflammatory state","acute respiratory distress syndrome","TLR3","ligand polyinosinic","polycytidylic acid","investigation","safety","mechanisms","onset of effective antimicrobial agents","functional assays","receptor","culture supernatant","situations","order","lipopolysaccharide","experimental models","therapeutic approaches","potential efficacy","Nerve","Toll","study","results","reported cases","objective","past"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of \u226570% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs \u003C70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (\u003C20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those \u226560 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs \u226570%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness. In addition to the primary endpoint on infection acquisition, developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and/or proxy biomarkers, since such secondary endpoints may prove critical in licensure, decision-making, and vaccine impact.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makhoul, Monia; Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Al-Omari, Sarah; Abu-Raddad, Laith J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6db33b86aad853b3e8f1abb20144551d6c5f1ca2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20070805v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine impact","vaccine development","efficacious vaccine","prophylactic vaccine","vaccine candidates","infection acquisition","infection duration","VEs","Vaccination impact","major impact","control SARS-CoV","key preferred vaccine product characteristics","critical disease case","disease progression outcomes","severe disease case","licensure","associated population-level impact","decision-making","social contact rate","number of vaccinations","major outbreak","number of virus introductions","moderate social-distancing intervention","developers","natural history","age-structured mathematical model","implementation","fundamental solution","proxy biomarkers","various efficacies","secondary endpoints","primary endpoint","efficacy","transmission","behavior compensation","reduction","application","addition","Results","China","increase","infectiousness","high cost-effectiveness","Probability","pipeline","Methods","Background","study","herd immunity","Gains","Conclusions","death","years"],"language":"en"},

Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03BC is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03BC = 2.1 \u00B1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maier, Benjamin F; Brockmann, Dirk","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc7a6b5d1852c5ecce2d20fd0d73d5f957ed7055.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mainland China"],"keyphrases":["observed scaling law","scaling law t","observed exponents","susceptible population","sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases","unconstrained outbreak","Mainland China","population wide isolation","recent outbreak of COVID","affected provinces","parsimonious model","range of exponents \u03BC","direct consequence of containment policies","quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals","implementation of containment strategies","unidentified infected individuals","systematic behavioral changes","basic reproduction number","wide range of parameters","secondary outbreaks","mitigation policies","number of asymptomatic","oligo-symptomatic","Chinese provinces","direct signature of effective contaiment strategies","similar future outbreaks","initial exponential growth","large reproduction rate","potential export induced COVID","response","identification of peak times","empirical data","substantial fraction","socio-economical heterogeneities","epidemic","estimates of local variations","emergent infectious diseases","early phase","spite of social","Quantitative fits","case counts","fundamental mechanisms","standard epidemiological models","insights","end","universality"],"language":"en"},

Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as Loss-of-Function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila Melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kummeling, Joost; Stremmelaar, Diante E; Raun, Nicholas; Reijnders, Margot RF; Willemsen, Marjolein H; Ruiterkamp-Versteeg, Martina; Schepens, Marga; Man, Calvin CO; Gilissen, Christian; Cho, Megan T; McWalter, Kirsty; Sinnema, Margje; Wheless, James W; Simon, Marleen EH; Genetti, Casie A; Casey, Alicia M; Terhal, Paulien A; van der Smagt, Jasper J; van Gassen, Koen L; Joset, Pascal; Bahr, Angela; Steindl, Katharina; Rauch, Anita; Keller, Elmar; Raas-Rothschild, Annick; Koolen, David A; Agrawal, Pankaj B; Hoffman, Trevor L; Powell-Hamilton, Nina N; Thiffault, Isabelle; Engleman, Kendra; Zhou, Dihong; Bodamer, Olaf; Hoefele, Julia; Riedhammer, Korbinian M; Schwaibold, Eva MC; Tasic, Velibor; Schubert, Dirk; Top, Deniz; Pfundt, Rolph; Higgs, Martin R; Kramer, Jamie M; Kleefstra, Tjitske","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da8a74ef5d62f7e3a3ea17695dbd02c1565e9647.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.879189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novo SETD1A variants","Heterozygous variants of SETD1A","haploinsufficiency of SETD1A","novo LoF variants","role","Drosophila Melanogaster SETD1A orthologue","pediatric individuals","observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A","patient cell lines","major structural brain defects","histone methyltransferases","H3K4 methyltransferases","Tyr1499Asp","patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines","cell cycle control","DNA damage repair defects","fly brain","normal memory","neurodevelopmental disorders","post development neuronal function","major contributing factors","differentiation of neural progenitors","regulation of neuronal processes","core set of symptoms","histone H3 lysine","catalytic SET domain","normal cognitive functioning","single underlying cause","intellectual disability","severe microcephaly","subtle facial dysmorphisms","global developmental delay","defective proliferation","postmitotic neurons","HMTs","Mendelian syndrome","Loss","psychiatric problems","cellular phenotypes","NDDs","methylation","clinical features","Previous studies","alleles","study","delAG","Gly535Alafs","schizophrenia"],"language":"en"},

Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need Findings: Between March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76% compared with 60% in the non-critical care group (p\u003C0,05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1,052 (1,009-1,101); p=0,0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1,968 (1,389-2,590) p\u003C0,0001) both at the time of hospital admission.

Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity. METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, and CD8\u002B T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

Researchers and analysts have suggested to use Google searches on smell loss as indicators of COVID-19 cases. However, such searches may be due to interest elicited by media coverage of the COVID-19-related smell loss, rather than attempts to understand self-symptoms. We analyzed searches related to 4 senses: smell and taste (both recently shown to be impaired in some COVID-19 patients), vision and sight (senses not currently known to be impaired in COVID-19 patients), and an additional general control (\u0022COVID-19 symptoms\u0022). Focusing on two countries with a large number of cases, Italy and the United States, we have compared Google Trends results per region or state to the number of new cases prevalence in that region. The analysis was performed for each of the 8 weeks ranging from March 4th till April 28th. No correlation with vision loss or sight loss searches was identified, while taste and smell loss searches were correlated with new COVID-19 cases during a limited time window, that starts when the number of weekly new cases reached for the first time 21357 cases in Italy (11-17 March) and 47553 in the US (18-24 March). Media effect on the specific symptoms searches was also analyzed, establishing a different impact according to the country. Our results suggest that Google Trends for taste loss and smell loss searches captured a genuine connection between these symptoms and new COVID-19 cases prevalence in the population. However, due to variability in correlation from week to week, and overall decrease in correlation as taste and smell loss are becoming known COVID-19 symptoms, recognized now by CDC and World Health Organization, Google Trends is no longer a reliable marker for monitoring the disease spread. The \u0022surprise rise\u0022 followed by decrease, probably attributable to knowledge saturation, should be kept in mind for future digital media analyses of potential new symptoms of COVID-19 or future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asseo, K.; Fierro, F.; Slavutsky, Y.; Frasnelli, J.; Niv, M.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R\u003E1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R\u003C1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shilei; Chen, Hua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75e68869f9b65bca661e768402395d9dede6de2c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUQC"],"locations":["Wuhan","Beijing","China","Shanghai","Guangzhou","South Korea","Japan","Iran"],"keyphrases":["Hubei","regions of China","dynamics of COVID","control measures","outbreak of COVID","inhibiting COVID","model SUQC","SUQC model","confirmation rate of Wuhan","tier cities of China","end times of COVID","multiple quarantine","artificial measures","high infectivity","high risk of outbreak","rigorous quarantine","Beijing","reproductive number R","un-quarantined infected individuals","daily released data","real dynamics","trend of epidemic","recent data","multiple characteristics distinct","existing epidemic models","daily observed case numbers","time delay","effects","infectious diseases","incubation","counties","South Korea","quantitative guide","analysis","Guangzhou","Shenzhen","effectiveness","Japan","Iran","Shanghai","rest","countries","coronavirus disease","country","clinical diagnosis","months","total"],"language":"en"},

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {\u002B/-} 0.02, 0.99 {\u002B/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {\u002B/-} 0.02), respectively.

Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Research question: The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Study Design and Methods: This was a multi-center retrospective study conducted in three tertiary hospitals. A total of 59 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed from January 23, 2020 to March 10, 2020. We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype. Results: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients. High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/l ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/l, p\u003C0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566, 95%CI[1.101-39.173], p=0.039). Interpretation Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients. Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Zhu, M.; Zha, L.; Lu, Z.; Ding, Z.; Yang, J.; Yang, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1787f294dba84d32d5251457ad706d61645bdda3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20071050v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eosinopenia"],"organizations":["Study Design"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-eosinopenia patients","severe patients","moderate patients","eosinopenia phenotype","Interpretation Eosinopenia","median age of patients","clincial characteristics of patients","clinical characteristics of COVID","poor prognosis of COVID","lymphocyte counts","common symptoms","severe type","lower counts of lymphocyte","fatigue","cells","Cough","sputum","Laboratory findings","Study Design","gastrointestinal symptoms","multi-center retrospective study","novel phenotype","higher proportions of dyspnea","eosnophils","COIVD","detailed analysis","global unprecedented pandemic infecting","Methods","fever","millon people","parameters","use of corticosteroids therapy","tertiary hospitals","international public health emergency","aim","Background","Coronavirus disease","value","High proportion of comorbidities","Results","vs","Research question","date","years old","total","male","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Few recent studies have suggested a positive protective correlation of the BCG vaccination policy of the countries with the observed COVID-19 severity. The current study was undertaken to reassess the existing data as of 4th April 2020. The incidence rates (cases per million population), Case Fatality Rates (CFR) and inherently more robust Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) were calculated across countries accounting for about 99% COVID-19 deaths. The initial scrutiny suggested a weaker association with BCG vaccination policy or BCG coverage, so positivity to the Tuberculin Sensitivity Test (TST)/ Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) as a measure of the potential protective effect of the resident populations exposure to Mycobacterium spp. whether from BCG vaccination or as a result of exposure to environmental mycobacteria was analyzed. The incidence rates (the number of cases per million population) decreased with an increase in % LTBI (TST/IGRA positivity) for the analyzed countries with R2 =0.6343, suggesting an exponentially negative covariation. However, the covariation of CFR estimates that ranged from 0.29% to 12.25 % (average 5.39%) among countries, was tenuous. Interim estimates of IFR (i-IFR), a more dependable measure for such studies, for the best and worst-case scenarios, i.e., i-IFR-l and i-IFR-h, predict on an average 20.57% to 30.15 % COVID-19 fatality rates globally, but individual country estimates display huge variation. Among countries accounting for 92.14% deaths (11 countries; top 20% countries included in current study) the estimate for lowest IFRs (i-IFR-l=4.16 (China) \u0026 i-IFR-h=4.61 (China)) and highest IFRs (i-IFR-l=96.39% (UK); \u0026 i-IFR-h=96.54% (UK)) displayed huge difference (average for the group: CFR=6.8 \u00B1 3.6%; i-IFR-l=34.97 \u00B1 30.55%; \u0026 i-IFR-h=44.20 \u00B1 29.08%). Currently, the worst affected countries Italy (CFR=12.25%; i-IFR-l=42.63%; i-IFR-h=48.69%) and Spain (CFR=9.39%; i-IFR-l=26.85%; i-IFR-h=36.60%) would seemingly cope with COVID-19 better than UK, Netherlands and USA while the countries Germany (CFR=1.40%; i-IFR-l=4.93%; i-IFR-h=17.49%) and Switzerland (CFR=3.01%; i-IFR-l=10.87%; i-IFR-h=16.23%) along with China could fare the best. The rest of the 80% countries (accounting for 6.74% deaths), seemed to have reduced mortality (CFR=2.45 \u00B1 2.01; i-IFR-l= 30.62 \u00B1 28.24%; i-IFR-h=40.99 \u00B1 30.47%) with associated high % LTBI (17.28 \u00B1 8.87) than top 20% countries.

The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant recipients. New methods like telemedicine are needed to provide care to these patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VC) in comparison to on-site visits (OSV) was performed during a six-week period in a lung transplant center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VC were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSV by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred via VC. Overall, physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% in comparison to an equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. For two VC patients, the indication for inpatient admission was established during the consultation. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Conclusions: By transitioning to VC, OSV for lung transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was reduced. VC was well received by the majority of patients.

Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Syed, Faiza; Sibgatullah, Syed","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/300183d862ef809c734535bb79928efa4cdcd208.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050369","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pakistan","epidemic","COVID","reported cases","exponential rate","peak number of infectious cases","policy interventions","magnitude","scale","numbers","virus","point","national database","rigorous prevention measures","SIR model","Mathematical models","results","infections","population","community"],"language":"en"},

In childhood, the risk is increasing with severity. Exacerbations are a strong phenotypic marker, particularly of severe and therapy-resistant asthma. These early-life events may influence the evolution and be involved in lung function decline. In children, asthma attacks are facilitated by exposure to allergens and pollutants, but are mainly triggered by microbial agents. Multiple studies have assessed immune responses to viruses, and to a lesser extend bacteria, during asthma exacerbation. Research has identified impairment of innate immune responses in children, related to altered pathogen recognition, interferon release, or anti-viral response. Influence of this host-microbiota dialog on the adaptive immune response may be crucial, leading to the development of biased T helper (Th)2 inflammation. These dynamic interactions may impact the presentations of asthma attacks, and have long-term consequences. The aim of this review is to synthesize studies exploring immune mechanisms impairment against viruses and bacteria promoting asthma attacks in children. The potential influence of the nature of infectious agents and/or preexisting microbiota on the development of exacerbation is also addressed. We then discuss our understanding of how these diverse host-microbiota interactions in children may account for the heterogeneity of endotypes and clinical presentations. Finally, improving the knowledge of the pathophysiological processes induced by infections has led to offer new opportunities for the development of preventive or curative therapeutics for acute asthma. A better definition of asthma endotypes associated with precision medicine might lead to substantial progress in the management of severe childhood asthma.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"St\u00E9phanie, Lejeune; Antoine, Deschildre; Rouzic Olivier, Le; Ilka, Engelmann; Rodrigue, Dessein; Muriel, Pichavant; Philippe, Gosset","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f72755f3c5e326fa69beff878a6c98d0dbe4ddd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000629522030280X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000629522030280X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbation","acute asthma","presentations of asthma attacks","children","main characteristic of asthma","therapy-resistant asthma","management of severe childhood asthma","better definition of asthma endotypes","development of exacerbation","immune mechanisms impairment","adaptive immune response","impairment of innate immune responses","viruses","development of preventive","preexisting microbiota","host-microbiota dialog","bacteria","diverse host-microbiota interactions","potential influence","development of biased T helper","heterogeneity of endotypes","Multiple studies","Abstract Exacerbations","clinical presentations","dynamic interactions","microbial agents","anti-viral response","nature of infectious agents","interferon release","altered pathogen recognition","substantial progress","precision medicine","curative therapeutics","strong phenotypic marker","evolution","infections","new opportunities","exposure","pathophysiological processes","inflammation","allergens","review","Research","long-term consequences","early-life events","lung function decline","knowledge","pollutants","risk","understanding","severity","aim"],"language":"en"},

To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H\u0026E, Masson\u2019s Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study. Taken together, our results demonstrate that native cellulose scaffolds are biocompatible and exhibit promising potential as a surgical biomaterial.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modulevsky, Daniel J.; Cuerrier, Charles M.; Pelling, Andrew E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/427813815949f8029dd8376a840966750b835f01.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/039644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Masson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["native scaffolds","native cellulose scaffolds","D scaffolds","implantable cellulose scaffolds","weeks post-implantation","immune response","weeks old","week post-implantation","tissue engineering","native hypanthium tissue of apples","histological analysis","period of study","surrounding dermis tissue","anti-CD31","potential applications","promising potential","characteristic foreign body response","week length","active fibroblast migration","anti-CD45 antibodies","active blood vessel formation","Masson\u2019s Trichrome","simple preparation methodology","proliferation of living cells","pro-angiogenic properties","deposition","immunocompetent mice","invasion","females","regenerative medicine","new collagen extracellular matrix","basis","slow deformation","wild-type","major approach","novel biomaterials","original shape","surgical biomaterial","results","Decellularization of existing tissues","concomitant","purposes","biocompatibility"],"language":"en"},

Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14\u002B\u002B monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14\u002B\u002BIL1B\u002B monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4\u002B T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4\u002B T memory cells and CD8\u002B T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and na\u00EFve B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23\u002BIGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1B and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccine and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Wen; Su, Wenru; Tang, Hao; Le, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Zheng, Yingfeng; Liu, XiuXing; Xie, Lihui; Li, Jianmin; Ye, Jinguo; Cui, Xiuliang; Miao, Yushan; Wang, Depeng; Dong, Jiantao; Xiao, Chuan-Le; Chen, Wei; Wang, Hongyang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c27de904a8b18419ec9e5b882a90d0b72838f4a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039362","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","NK cells","plasma cells","T memory cells","na\u00EFve B cells","recovery of COVID","unique signature of immune cells","treatment of COVID","inflammatory storm","ERS patients","transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","evidence of inflammatory immune signature","IGHV3","novel B cell receptor","inflammatory cytokine storm","inflammatory genes expression","early recovery stage","detailed analysis of monocytes","CD4","change of key immune cell subsets","high level of inflammatory markers","Immune system dysregulation","identification of novel BCR","SARS-CoV","increased ratio of classical CD14","development of vaccine","study","single-cell technology","virus vaccine development","novel candidate target gene","integrated analysis","greater abundance of CD14","lymphopenia","humans","CD8","CSF","states","TNFSF13","expanded clone","IGHJ4","monoclonal state","IL1B","antibodies","strongest pairing frequencies","nature killer","confirmed isotypes","IGKV3","hospital discharge","IGHV1","addition","specificity","healthy control","people"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Feng; Zhang, Jinmei; Cao, Menglan; Zhang, Yong; Hui, Cang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/729a9faa0dd40ae0392c7590418583096673a5b4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","South Korea","Australia"],"keyphrases":["transmission rate","negative damping rate","efficacy of transmission control measures","human transmission","clear pattern of exponential damping","Successful control measures","COVID","transmission patterns","efficacy of implemented control measures","global disease control","exponential decline","active measures","additional control efforts","certain countries","fastest spread","viral spread","global pandemic","exponential infectious growth","simple model","China","global public health emergency","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","novel coronavirus disease","World Health Organisation","estimated peak time","USA","Australia","existing data","variety of intervention","SARS","message","excellent fit","acceleration","Slight increments","fight","final number of infections","cases","regions","indicator","South Korea","high capacity","positive outcome","entire nation","days","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

Age cohort CFRs were also examined. Findings: We observed major difference in the mortality rates when comparing South Korea to Australia in both the simple age adjusted fatality rates and in the disease hazard curve. On a like-for-like basis, the CFR for South Korea appears to be close to double the Australian rate (aggregate; 2.4% vs 1.4%). Interpretation: Neither differences in the time pattern of the peaking of the case load of confirmed cases, nor differences in the size of age cohorts of confirmed cases explain the difference in mortality observed. We discuss possible explanations that point the way for further investigation. Funding: nil.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collignon, P.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an out-patient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom sudden smell loss for screening procedures. Methods: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria, completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients main symptoms, time course and an additional self-assessment of the patients current smell, taste function and nasal breathing compared to the level before onset of symptoms. Results: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only twelve out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom sudden smell loss in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom sudden smell loss can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a PPV of 63% and NPV of 97% for COVID-19. Conclusion: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be included in the WHO symptoms list and should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19 associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haehner, A.; Draf, J.; Draeger, S.; de With, K.; Hummel, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3b32b300ff4802a16708db87b2def4644bc7818.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081356v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptom sudden smell loss","patients current smell","associated smell loss","high frequency of smell loss","frequency of olfactory loss","negative patients","patients main symptoms","symptom of SARS","SARS-CoV","acute viral smell impairment","early symptom","acute olfactory impairment","olfactory complaints","onset of symptoms","symptoms list","corona testing center","non-hospitalized COVID","coronavirus testing center","blocked nose","fulfilled corona testing criteria","diagnostic value","nasal breathing","nasal airflow","high specificity","standardized diagnostic questionnaire","cross-sectional controlled cohort study","time course","additional self-assessment","taste function","Recent reports","screening procedures","week period","level","patient population","contrast","Methods","Introduction","PPV","Changes","NPV","disease","Conclusion","infection","sensitivity","aim","Results"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants \u003C 32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that are anticipated to have an income exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected in this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analyzed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age \u003C 32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighing less than 1500 grams. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increased of apneas (75%) and the needed of oxygenotherapy. Conclusions HRV infections are prevalent in the NICU, and preterm infants have a high risk of infections with clinical relevance.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Carrasco, E.; Calvo, C.; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, M.

However, there were few studies about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID-19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Findings Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54.8% vs. 87.5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization, and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID-19 (32.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune-inflammation-based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples.

Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation. Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 control COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2. Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used : 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2. In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning.

Such control measures are essentially implemented to achieve a sufficient reduction in the effective reproduction number during an outbreak. In this study, we use a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait and forecast the potential burden on the healthcare system. We calibrate the model against daily numbers of detected infection and death cases using a maximum likelihood framework and estimate both the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Our results indicate that the early control measures implemented in Kuwait had the effect of delaying the intensity of the outbreak but were unsuccessful in reducing Rt below 1. This highlights a need for a systematic investigation of the current public health interventions as well as a scientific surveillance tool that is sufficiently sensitive to outbreak temporal dynamics.

Daily reported numbers (March 29th to April 28th) are based on Our World in Data database (derived from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ECDC). In all seven countries, numbers of new cases peaked on Thursday-Friday, five days after the weekend, corresponding with a reported ~5-day lag between contact with an infected person and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Death tolls peaked on Wednesday-Thursday in all seven countries, ~12-14 days following a weekend, corresponding with the reported median of 14-day hospitalization before death. One may suspect that the weekend restricts the availability of testing or reporting of new cases, that are eventually reported during the following week. However, to completely account for both observations, this artifact should occur uniformly in all the above-mentioned countries and consistently along the entire month studied. Moreover, deaths are defined events and seems less likely to be recorded or reported inaccurately, at least for the vast majority of cases. Thus, we hypothesize that an increase in inter-generational social interactions occurs during the weekend, which facilitates transfer of COVID-19 from younger people to older vulnerable individuals. These and additional infected older people account for most recognized COVID-19 cases and deaths, which may occur at regular time intervals, specifically in this vulnerable population. Additional explanations may include weekly rhythms in immune functions, hospital care quality, or other various health-related behaviors. Our hypotheses should be re-tested and refined based on databases that accurately report events times when these will become available.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricon-Becker, I.; Tarrasch, R.; Blinder, P.; Ben-Eliyahu, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b47a0bdd04d1a5b9887c91a2e144a4217e2bfecc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.20089508v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Center for Disease Control","ECDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reported numbers","reported median","European countries","weekend","above-mentioned countries","numbers of new cases","recognized COVID","transfer of COVID","additional infected older people","day lag","day hospitalization","day cycle","new casesa","vast majority of cases","days","account","older vulnerable individuals","infected person","younger people","European Center","Additional explanations","Data database","events times","vulnerable population","defined events","Death tolls","following week","hospital care quality","immune functions","weekly rhythms","Belgiumb","Canadab","Disease Control","Prevention","Netherlandsa","inter-generational social interactions","developed North-American","various health-related behaviors","Italya","Switzerlanda","increase","databases","Spaina","USAb","Germanya","contact","Swedena","manifestation of clinical symptoms","availability of testing","regular time intervals","ECDC","UKa","entire month","hypotheses","observations","artifact","World","deathsb"],"language":"en"},

Finding appropriate measures that effectively contain the spread of the epidemic without putting a too severe pressure on social and economic life is major challenge for modern predictive approaches. To assess the impact of confinement (March 17th till May 11th) and deconfinement, we develop a novel rate model to monitor and predict the spread of the epidemic and its impact on the health care system. The model accounts for age-dependent interactions between population groups and predicts consequences for various infection categories such as number of infected, hospitalized, load of intensive care units (ICU), number of death, recovered and more. We use online health care data for the five most infected regions of France to calibrate the model. At day of deconfinement (May 11th), we find that 13% (around 4.8M) of the population is infected in the five most affected regions of France (extrapolating to 5.8M for France). The model predicts that if the reproduction rate R0 is reduced by at least a factor of 2.5-3 for all age groups, which could be achieved by wearing masks and social distancing, a significant second peak could be prevented. However, if the reduction in R0 for the age group 0-25 would be less and below 2 (school openings), a second peak is unavoidable in which case the ICU will be saturated. In that context testing should be focused on children, but it will nevertheless have a limited impact on reducing the spread.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reingruber, J.; Papale, A.; holcman, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20099465v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["infected regions of France","epidemic","spread","number of infected","age groups","model accounts","affected regions of France","novel rate model","ICU","health care system","population groups","peak","limited impact","impact of confinement","online health care data","age-dependent interactions","reproduction rate R0","social distancing","load of intensive care units","number of death","day of deconfinement","economic life","major challenge","consequences","various infection categories","modern predictive approaches","severe pressure","extrapolating","masks","reduction","SARS-COV","context testing","children","school openings","appropriate measures","entire world","factor"],"language":"en"},

Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19. These findings add to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggested novel therapeutic targets and strategy.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Yang, Minghui; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Guobao; Li, Yanjie; Xing, Li; Peng, Ling; Wei, Jinli; Cao, Mengli; Zheng, Haixia; Wu, Weibo; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Delin; Xu, Zhixiang; Wang, Haiyan; Zhang, Mingxia; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Lei; Liu, Yingxia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebed882da10cbf669cbb86802e9fa07a4a33ef91.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20029975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Murray"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe cases","progression of COVID","outcome of COVID","SARS-CoV","disease severity","MCP","detailed role of cytokines","disease deterioration","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","infection","combination of IP","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS","Serial detection of IP","fatal outcome","previous study","AUC","cytokine storm","receiver-operating characteristics","continuous high levels","biggest area","ROC","curve","novel therapeutic targets","understanding","independent predictors","limited case number","plasma samples","PaO2","FaO2","Murray score","serious threat","public health","strategy","calculations","admission","findings","Wuhan","conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

People infected with this highly contagious virus present with clinically inapparent, mild or severe disease. Currently, the presence of the virus in individual patients and at the population level is being monitored by testing symptomatic cases by PCR for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (70 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate the performance of the RBD as an antigen for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) to antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a robust correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, strongly support the use of RBD-based antibody assays for population-level surveillance and as a correlate of neutralizing antibody levels in people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Premkumar, L.; Segovia-Chumbez, B.; Jadi, R.; Martinez, D.

This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP).

For example, for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), how is a case defined? Hubei province in China changed its case definition twice in a fortnight-from laboratory-confirmed cases to clinically-confirmed cases without laboratory tests, and back to laboratory-confirmed cases. This caused confusion in the reported number of cases. If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested? Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only \u0022suspected cases\u0022 are laboratory-tested in most countries. This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a \u0022suspect case\u0022 defined? With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase. What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing? This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration).

Using as input the infection fatality rate and the interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the total infections is 0.13\\% (median), implying that tests are currently finding 1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates, this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via serological testing in the USA. From the estimates of the number of infections we infer that the first COVID-19 cases were seeded in Mumbai between late December 2019 and early February 2020. provided the doubling times remained unchanged since then.

Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibiliy, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptiblity with temporary immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Kok Yew; Gui, Meei Mei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fda2bde9fefad6f0b55c174fe6dc6022d0c4200d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01974v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["South Korea","Northern Ireland"],"keyphrases":["current pandemic","SEIR model","proposed model","modified SEIRS model","current projections","efficiency of control action","current scenario","control action measures","prediction studies","case studies","recovery","COVID","case data","development","current global health emergency","additional exit conditions","computational simulations of infectious viral diseases","real-world data","future projections","SARS-CoV","form of death rates","ageing factor","well-known method","South Korea","population","resusceptiblity","time delay","paper","battle","greatest challenges mankind face","Northern Ireland","possible outcomes","generation","clinical symptoms","MERS","influenza","specific information","early indications","important role","verification","huge variations","temporary immune response","Ebola","resusceptibiliy","spread","possibility of resusceptibility","epidemics","virus"],"language":"en"},

Recently, several efforts have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties. Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual\u0027s location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest. We, also, validate the practicality of Quest and evaluate it thoroughly via an actual campus-scale deployment at UC Irvine over a very large dataset of over 50M tuples.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Peeyush; Mehrotra, Sharad; Panwar, Nisha; Sharma, Shantanu; Venkatasubramanian, Nalini; Wang, Guoxi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5471cdc4f701cd7bb2edc6ec478251eaa270cdfc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02510v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GDPR","UC Irvine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["privacy techniques","range of privacy","practicality of Quest","WiFi data","individual privacy rights","WiFi connectivity data","social distancing","spaces","Contact tracing","individuals","opt-in policies","cellular data records","enabled applications","smartphone applications","personal information","opt-in mechanisms","UC Irvine","implementation","Bluetooth beacons","proposed security","knowledge","individual\u0027s location history","adherence","actual campus-scale deployment","impacted regions","spread of pandemics","regulations","adversaries","large dataset","technologies","interactions","flow of people","organizations","design choices","secure protocols","main mitigation strategies","vicinity","safety of employees","occupants","CCPR","exposure alerts","GDPR","architecture","movements","need","support","system","confirmed patient","users","COVID","tuples","manner","goal","solutions","efforts","paper","parties"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we revisit the affine quantization method on the half line. We formulate and solve some simple models, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gouba, Laure","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6dc6cec057c6f797619e061c2de46c96fdc562c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08696v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["affine quantization method","Dirac\u0027s canonical quantization method","investigation of quantization methods","alternative method","quantum physics","case of conventional quantum mechanics","free particle","mathbb","worthwhile endeavour","positive result","situations","half line","non-trivial phase spaces","simple models","harmonic oscillator","similarity","history","paper","ordering problem"],"language":"en"},

As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sapiezynski, Piotr; Pruessing, Johanna; Sekara, Vedran","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11297v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact tracing apps","broad lack of internet access","COVID","work","equitable policy response","potential exposure","certain groups","tech-enabled response","disappointing adoption levels","required adoption thresholds","potential consequences of over-","recurring implicit assumptions","existing state","world","smartphone ownership","civil society","people","virus","human rights","long term impact","corporate surveillance powers","academics","governments","elderly","opt-in basis","needs","right way","notifications","debate","multitude of scenarios","limited ability","lower incomes","s global spread","technology","smartphones","pandemic","highest risks","distance","corporations","proposed solutions","testing","fixes","onset"],"language":"en"},

The model is fit to a given dataset by minimizing the free energy, for which statistical physics and a path-integral method are utilized. Because the process of event occurrence is stochastic, parameter estimation is inevitably accompanied by errors, and it can ultimately occur that exogenous and endogenous factors cannot be captured even with the best estimator. We obtained four regimes categorized according to whether respective factors are detected. By applying the analytical method to real time series of debate in a social-networking service, we have observed that the estimated exogenous and endogenous factors are close to the first comments and the follow-up comments, respectively. This method is general and applicable to a variety of data, and we have provided an application program, by which anyone can analyze any series of event times.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koyama, Shinsuke; Shinomoto, Shigeru","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/102ab41f432f6fd482d16724b0416a326de9a218.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00659v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endogenous factors","process of event occurrence","series of event times","single series of event","intrinsic factors","occurrence times","analytical method","respective factors","Hawkes process","exogenous fluctuations","path-integral method","model","inhomogeneous Poisson process","real time series of debate","endogenous chain-reaction mechanisms","follow-up comments","statistical physics","free energy","parameter estimation","given dataset","social-networking service","variety of data","environmental changes","errors","regimes","events","system","best estimator","application program","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Travel time and mode share data from the American Community Survey of the US Census Bureau, for metro areas across the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel times to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume safe, high throughput operations quickly.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Yue; Barbour, William; Samaranayake, Samitha; Work, Dan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01610v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Census Bureau","BPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transit systems","transit usage","different portions of transit","large transit ridership","resulting travel time","road","single occupancy vehicles","single-occupancy vehicles","BPR model","mode share data","average travel times","transportation mode share lead","extreme traffic","worse traffic","number of cars","following question","car pool users","US Census Bureau","estimated number of commuters","American Community Survey","risk","metro areas","high throughput operations","increased vehicle volumes","cities","pandemic","people","communities","scenarios","COVID","article","congestion","end"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households\u0027 decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters).","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Amory; Markhvida, Maryia; Hallegatte, St\u0027ephane; Walsh, Brian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3aedda055e39b7f5bd55eaea79e2059e2149e74e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05945v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UI"],"locations":["San Francisco Bay Area","Bay Area"],"keyphrases":["individuals","household income","socio-economic impact of COVID","income loss","crisis period","recovery period","direct impact of distancing","micro-economic model","household-level impacts of COVID","depleted savings","impact of indirect macroeconomic effects","CARES","lowest income earners","precautionary savings","consumption","place period","months","poverty close","poverty rate","increase","social-distancing measures","pre-crisis level","massive economic shock","average recovery time","San Francisco Bay Area","combination of UI","case study","absence of social protection","effects of unemployment insurance","potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks","role of uncertainty","world","shutdowns","households\u0027 decision-making","business interruptions","accounting","certain communities","pandemic","natural disasters","step","periods","federal stimulus","lockdown","regional scale","shelter","severity","drop","relative terms","year"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing is known to weaken incidences and deaths due to COVID-19, however, there are detrimental economic and psychological effects. This motivates us to analyze incidences (and deaths) of COVID-19 along with a measure of the health of the US economy (i.e., the adjusted closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial), and a measure of the public interest in COVID-19 through Google Trends data. The model we implement is developed to be easily adapted to a data scientist\u0027s preferred method for continuous data, which is done to aid future analyses of this important dataset. This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g., continuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that\u0022converts\u0022a statistical model for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for multi-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the continuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the preferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The implementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as the hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we demonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different preferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial mixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradley, Jonathan R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab6d4e29549359ce647a22e67e1e83c4873ce388.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09983v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","Google Trends","HGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bayesian model","HGT model","continuous data","statistical model","transformed data","COVID","data scientist\u0027s preferred method","Google Trends data","multi-response data sets","different preferred models","continuous responses","spatial mixed effects","psychological effects","necessary public health measure","incidences","deaths","Social distancing","spatio-temporal mixed effects","posterior replicates","posterior distribution","all-purpose method","important dataset","US economy","hierarchical generalized transformation","multiple response types","Bayesian additive regression trees","BART","latent conjugate multivariate","adjusted closing price","Dow Jones Industrial","cornoavirus disease","individuals","LCM","physical distance","effort","future analyses","values","flexibility","implementation","approach","steps","binomial counts","simulation"],"language":"en"},

Although governments all over the world have taken severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities, quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\\cite{ref2} has reported that 79\\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benreguia, Badreddine; Moumen, Hamouma; Merzoug, Mohammed Amine","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea835e8a1aee7bc3071b93634f4549b5d39e42d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05523v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["undocumented patients","coronavirus pandemic","suspected patients","asymptomatic patients","lot of persons","real number of infected people","confine persons","actual number","large quick spreading of coronavirus","known number of infections","governments","pandemic propagation","global pandemic","emergence of symptoms","apparent symptoms","efficient control","social distancing","investigation system","confirmed infections","proposed system","large numbers of deaths","economic activities","main factor","high-contamination sites","quarantines","close contact","rapid isolation of suspicious cases","IoT","authorities","Internet of Things","countries","days","China","travel restrictions","major reason","severe measurements","world","paper","infectious places","critical situation","context","study","ref2","goal","danger"],"language":"en"},

We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network that changes over time, while we observe the results of a dynamic process spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network. We develop an on-line algorithm that relies on stochastic convex optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic network inference problem. We apply our algorithm to information diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment with more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading over the network in a one year period.

The initial primary and secondary masses are M1i=15Mo and M2i=2.5Mo, respectively. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600-1000Ro, and eccentricities in the range of e=0-0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by jets, followed by a wind from the SN IIb progenitor, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of M(H,f)=0.05Mo. This is compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. We find that in many cases, with and without the extra mass removal by jets, the system can enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) phase, and then gets out from it. Despite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially increases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens earlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass removal by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE channel increases the number of progenitors relative to that by RLOF alone by about a factor of two.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shishkin, Dmitry; Soker, Noam","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1de41615718f030a06e438d8cfeb579a51cf4dd4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14096v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Roche"],"organizations":["GEE","MESA","SN","CEE","RLOF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["jets","extra mass removal","hydrogen mass","SN IIb progenitors","formation of SNe IIb","GEE channel","formation of Type IIb supernovae","cases RLOF","grazing envelope evolution","common envelope evolution","CEE","evolution of eccentric binary systems","initial primary","number of progenitors relative","initial semi-major axes","M1i","frame","parameter space","secondary masses","stellar evolutionary code MESA","exploding star","large uncertainties","phase","Roche lobe overflow","wind","role of eccentricity","earlier conclusions","circular orbits","eccentricities","M2i","likelihood","range of e","factor"],"language":"en"},

The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world? What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent, region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases?

We use various state-of-the-art privacy-preserving cryptographic primitives to design a protocol that can best be described as aggregated private information retrieval (APIR). Our protocol is based on homomorphic encryption, with additional measures to protect against malicious requests from clients. We have implemented our APIR protocol in the SEAL library and tested it for parameters suitable to create a coronavirus hotspot map for entire nationstates.

In this article, we discuss the methodologies from the group testing literature and its relevance to COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically, we investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are pooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed on these groups to discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to pooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the presence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that could reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze the efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical relevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be developed that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis performed without increasing the number of PCR tests.

We explore the sensitivity of ongoing optical surveys searching for kNe and propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage and source distance. Considering that the O3 LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star merger candidates were at distances about 5 times further than GW170817, we find that efficient $gri$ counterpart search would require reaching a limiting magnitude $m_{\\rm lim}=$ 23 mag, given the model phase-space.

We need less contact with each other to decrease the chance of infection, but this means loss of economic activity, as well. This tradeoff is inevitable in our society, because we still need direct communication and commuting, so far. The focus of our paper is the structure of society, on which we have direct contacts. We study on spreading process with artificial sosiety model, where each agent has daily cycle and go office and back home, every day. At the same time, infection spreads along SIR model. We show both slow infection and short commuting can be realized with some structures and vice versa. The most effective factor for such features is modularity of society. In highly modular society, agents live around the destined office, but agents commute long way to their office and can be infected fast, in not modular society.

An estimated 2.95 billion people in 2019 used social media worldwide. The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a tsunami of social media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant news, guidelines and precautions to people. According to WHO, uncontrolled conspiracy theories and propaganda are spreading faster than the COVID-19 pandemic itself, creating an infodemic and thus causing psychological panic, misleading medical advises, and economic disruption. Accordingly, discussions have been initiated with the objective of moderating all COVID-19 communications, except those initiated from trusted sources such as the WHO and authorized governmental entities. This paper presents a large-scale study based on data mined from Twitter. Extensive analysis has been performed on approximately one million COVID-19 related tweets collected over a period of two months. Furthermore, the profiles of 288,000 users were analyzed including unique users profiles, meta-data and tweets context. The study noted various interesting conclusions including the critical impact of the (1) exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis to redirect readers to irrelevant topics and (2) widespread of unauthentic medical precautions and information. Further data analysis revealed the importance of using social networks in a global pandemic crisis by relying on credible users with variety of occupations, content developers and influencers in specific fields. In this context, several insights and findings have been provided while elaborating computing and non-computing implications and research directions for potential solutions and social networks management strategies during crisis periods.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mourad, Azzam; Srour, Ali; Harmanani, Haidar; Jenainatiy, Cathia; Arafeh, Mohamad","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc0720c7bb3a419889a1830a85f4e9ddbfc741b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08820v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advent of social media","tsunami of social media","Coronavirus COVID","data analysis","social networks management strategies","credible users","crisis periods","global pandemic crisis","unique users profiles","meta-data","tweets context","people","widespread of unauthentic medical precautions","misleading medical","relevant news","related tweets","large-scale study","News creation","Extensive analysis","non-computing implications","potential solutions","research directions","content developers","variety of occupations","influencers","various interesting conclusions","propaganda","critical impact","specific fields","psychological panic","irrelevant topics","guidelines","information","readers","importance","uncontrolled conspiracy theories","consumption","economic disruption","infodemic","findings","exploitation","authorized governmental entities","trusted sources","insights","paper","platforms","objective","communications","Twitter","discussions","months"],"language":"en"},

The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), the cryogenic spectrometer of the Athena space X-ray observatory of the European Space Agency will be developed by a large international consortium. The travel footprint associated with the development of the X-IFU is to be minimized. For that purpose, a travel footprint calculator has been developed and first released to the X-IFU consortium members. The calculator uses seven different emission factors and methods differing by up to a factor of ~5 for the same flying distance. The observed differences illustrate the lack of standards and regulations for computing the footprint of flight travels and are explained primarily, though partly, by different accountings of non-CO2 effects. The calculator enables us to compute the travel footprint of a large set of travels and can help identify a meeting place that minimizes the overall travel footprint for a large set of possible city hosts, e.g. cities with large airports. The calculator also includes the option for a minimum distance above which flying is considered the most suitable transport option ; below that chosen distance, the emission of train journeys are considered. To demonstrate its full capabilities, the calculator is first run on one of the largest scientific meetings; the fall meeting of the AGU and meetings of the IPCC for which it is used to compute the location that would minimize the travel footprint. Then the travel footprint of X-IFU is estimated to be ~500 tons of CO2-eq/yr.

As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths worldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ($R_0\u003E1$, $R_c\u003E1$) is already present in all the five provinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long term predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show oscillatory behaviour. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei. Thus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in the affected areas.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nadim, Sk Shahid; Ghosh, Indrajit; Chattopadhyay, Joydev","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79e80112fc23baa29964e0014728adfb04daeb1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08150v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["symptomatic COVID cases","human transmission","compartmental epidemic model of COVID","human spread","Hubei","epidemic outbreak","reported cases of coronavirus disease","decreasing trend of new COVID cases","proposed model","necessary human resources","independent self-sustaining human","control reproduction number","outbreak of respiratory disease","modification factor","effective management of quarantined individuals","isolation","disease burden","provinces of China","basic reproduction number","health care planning","management of isolated individuals","Health care officials","transmission rate","efficiency of quarantine","novel coronavirus","reported deaths","Short-term predictions","long term predictions","medications","protective masks","reduction","Guangdong","utmost importance","daily data","infected people","confirmed infections","Henan","Zhejiang","affected areas","contacts","forecasting","oscillatory behaviour","Hunan","detailed stability analysis","Numerical results","findings","limited resource","dynamics","period","system","study"],"language":"en"},

We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020. The Wuhan experience provides an exemplary lesson for the whole world to learn in combating COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, George Xianzhi; Di, Lan; Gu, Yudi; Qian, Guoqi; Qian, Xiaosong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9497944622371ffb45f9ebf179721203014b54e9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02278v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan COVID","trajectory of COVID","iSEIR model","turning period of CIVID","Wuhan experience","updated model","observed daily cases of COVID","so-called critical Turning Period","epidemic curve","timely prediction","classic SEIR model","underlying mathematical model","infectious disease epidemic","timely actions","general framework","outbreak","study","cases dynamics","observed effectiveness","Isolation Control Program","hospitals","government","services","essential industry sectors","Lockdown","peak demands","adequate time","set of differential equations","world\u0027s current battle","relevant authority","following days","exemplary lesson","aftermath planning","midnight","China","insightful information","year","pandemic","input","goal","week"],"language":"en"},

Follow-up scans every 3-5 days are often recommended for disease progression. It has been reported that bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacification (GGO) with or without consolidation are predominant CT findings in COVID-19 patients. However, due to lack of computerized quantification tools, only qualitative impression and rough description of infected areas are currently used in radiological reports. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based segmentation system is developed to automatically quantify infection regions of interest (ROIs) and their volumetric ratios w.r.t. the lung. The performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. The average Dice simiarility coefficient showed 91.6% agreement between automatic and manual infaction segmentations, and the mean estimation error of percentage of infection (POI) was 0.3% for the whole lung. Finally, possible applications, including but not limited to analysis of follow-up CT scans and infection distributions in the lobes and segments correlated with clinical findings, were discussed.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shan, Fei; Gao, Yaozong; Wang, Jun; Shi, Weiya; Shi, Nannan; Han, Miaofei; Xue, Zhong; Shen, Dinggang; Shi, Yuxin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f41870a413cfed01b83d6463ca8492d9cc655d20.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04655v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection distributions","infection region segmentation","segmented infection regions","chest CT scans","CT imaging","analysis of follow-up CT scans","predominant CT findings","staging COVID","based segmentation system","patients","lung","possible manual intervention of automatic results","manual infaction segmentations","total segmentation time","clinical findings","possible applications","fast manual delineation of training samples","qualitative impression","agreement","mean estimation error of percentage","diagnosis","assessment","lobes","rough description of infected areas","delineated ones","peripheral ground glass opacification","GGO","minutes","segments","consolidation","lack of computerized quantification tools","average Dice simiarility coefficient","human","ROIs","radiologists","deep learning","loop","strategy","days","volumetric ratios","POI","iterations of model","radiological reports","disease progression","HITL","paper","performance"],"language":"en"},

Involvement of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis by SARS-CoV-2 is currently an actively pursued research area. An increased susceptibility to infection in individuals with DM, HT and CVD together with higher levels of circulating ACE2 in these settings presents a scenario where interaction with soluble ACE2 may result in disseminated virus-receptor complexes that could enhance virus acquisition and pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-ACE2 interaction, both membrane bound and in the cell free context may contribute to elucidating the role of co-morbidities in increased susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis. Both Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy in mitigating viral carriage in infected individuals. Furthermore, each of these compounds generate active metabolites which in turn may also modulate virus-receptor interaction and thus influence clinical outcomes. In this study, we model the structural interaction of S1 with both full-length and soluble ACE2. Additionally, therapeutic drugs and their active metabolites were docked with soluble ACE2 protein. Our results show that S1 from either of the reported Indian sequences can bind both full-length and soluble ACE2, albeit with varying affinity that can be attributed to a reported substitution in the RBD. Furthermore, both Azythromycin and HCQ together with their active metabolites can allosterically affect, to a range of extents, binding of S1 to ACE2.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jagtap, Dhanashree; SelvaaKumar, C; Mahale, Smita; Patel, Vainav","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b694888d27880c407c0001df68fe7055a565f2bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06361v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HT","CVD","HCQ"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["soluble ACE2 protein","receptor binding domain-ACE2 interaction","virus-receptor interaction","infection","active metabolites","SARS-CoV","pathogenesis","higher levels of circulating ACE2","structural interaction of S1","increased susceptibility","binding of S1","disseminated virus-receptor complexes","CVD","HT","virus acquisition","HCQ","infected individuals","reported substitution","reported Indian sequences","highest burden of non-communicable diseases","diabetes mellitus","efficacy","role of co-morbidities","membrane","settings","turn","scenario","cardio vascular disease","viral carriage","hypertension","enzyme","India bears","vulnerable target","range of extents","cell free context","Hydroxychloroquine","angiotensin","COVID","therapeutic drugs","compounds","clinical outcomes","varying affinity","pursued research area","Involvement","RBD","Azithromycin","study","Azythromycin","pandemic","results"],"language":"en"},

These assays have been optimized to maximize reaction efficiency, reduce the amount of sample required (down to 1ng RNA per real time RT-PCR reaction) and to select the most appropriate housekeeping genes. Using these assays, the expression of each of the tested genes could be detected in ferret lymph node cells stimulated with mitogens or infected with influenza virus in vitro.

These plasmid DNA-based reverse genetics systems thus offer new possibilities for investigating AHSV biology and development of designer AHSV vaccine strains.","publish_time":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conradie, Andel\u00E9 M.; Stassen, Liesel; Huismans, Henk; Potgieter, Christiaan A.; Theron, Jacques","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cd106749fd0faaf43c1259f1234af9e2feda9a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172382.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216301751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657835/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216301751","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AHSV biology","infectious AHSV","reverse genetics systems","T7 RNA polymerase promoter","T7 RNA polymerase expression cassette","full-length double-stranded RNA genome segments of AHSV","development of designer AHSV vaccine strains","different plasmid","enabled virus recovery","plasmid DNA","enhanced virus recovery","required plasmids","rescue plasmids","L929 cells","utility of African horse sickness virus","new possibilities","BSR","control","cross-serotype reassortant viruses","possibility","cDNAs","cell line","effort"],"language":"en"},

This outbreak resulted in 774 deaths. However, the spatial features and potential determinants of SARS input-output flows remain unclear. METHODS: We used an adjusted spatial interaction model to examine the spatial effects and potential factors associated with SARS input-output flows. RESULTS: The presence of origin-based spatial dependence positively affected SARS input-output flows from the neighbours of the origin regions. Two components of the input-output flows, migrant and hospitalization flows, exhibited distinctive features. The origin-based and destination-based spatial dependence positively affected migrant flows (i.e., due to those seeking jobs) from the neighbours of origin and destination locations. Similarly, the destination-based spatial dependence also positively affected hospitalization flows (i.e., due to those seeking treatment) from the neighbours of destination regions. However, the origin-to-destination based spatial dependence negatively affected hospitalisation flows from the neighbours of origin-to-destination regions. The direct effects accounted for 78 % of the SARS input-output flows, which was 3.56-fold greater than the indirect effects. Differences in regional income drove the SARS input-output flows. Therefore, urban income had a positive effect, whereas rural income had a negative effect. Total interregional flows increased by 3.54 % with a 1 % increase in urban income, and intraregional flows increased by 8.35 %. In contrast, the total interregional flows decreased by 3.38 % with a 1 % increase in rural income, and intraregional flows declined by 2.29 %. Railway capacity, per person gross domestic product (PGDP), urban rate and the law of distance decay also affected the input-output flows. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the SARS input-output flows presented significant geographic spatial heterogeneity and spatial effects. Income differences were the major cause of the flows between pairs of regions. Railway capacity, PGDP, and urban rate also played important roles. These findings provide valuable information for the Chinese government to control the future spread of nationwide epidemics.

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician\u2013patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms \u201Ctelemedicine\u201D and \u201CCOVID-19.\u201D RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic.

A major impact on hospitalization for all-cause gastroenteritis was observed also. BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccination with exclusive use of RotaTeq was added to the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in September 2009. The objective of our study was to estimate the effectiveness and impact of RotaTeq after 4 years of follow-up. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, we conducted a prospective surveillance study of children aged \u003C16 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and admitted in 2 hospitals in Finland. Rotavirus and other gastroenteritis viruses were detected in stool samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effectiveness of RotaTeq was investigated by using a case-control design; wild-type rotavirus-positive children were classified as \u201Ccases\u201D and rotavirus-negative children as \u201Ccontrols.\u201D Hospital discharge records were used to estimate the impact of RotaTeq on rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) and all-cause AGE (AC-AGE) hospitalizations of age-eligible children in the NIP by comparing the prevaccination (2001\u20132006) and post-NIP seasons (2009\u20132013). RESULTS: The crude estimate of the effectiveness of RotaTeq to prevent RV-AGE hospitalization in NIP age-eligible children was 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%\u201398.4%). No change in prevalent wild-type rotavirus genotypes was observed. Vaccine-derived rotaviruses were detected in 8% of the children with RV-AGE, with a probable causal association in 2 children. Hospital discharge records revealed that RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations in children aged \u003C16 years decreased in the two post-NIP seasons by 79% and 58%, respectively, compared to those in the prevaccination seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Over 4 years of follow-up, high rotavirus vaccine coverage in the NIP (\u003E95%) has led to a major reduction in RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations without a resurgence of rotavirus activity. However, rotavirus continues to circulate in older unvaccinated children.","publish_time":"2016-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemming-Harlo, Maria; Vesikari, Timo; Uhari, Matti; Renko, Marjo; Salminen, Marjo; Torcel-Pagnon, Laurence; Hartwig, Susanne; Simondon, Francois; Bricout, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69ef921d1d1fc43f4f1773712e80c6da957ba219.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107484.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piw061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27760800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Immunization Programme"],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["rotavirus-associated AGE","hospitalizations of age","NIP age-eligible children","RV-AGE hospitalization","rotavirus-negative children","AC-AGE hospitalizations","Rotavirus vaccination","all-cause AGE","rotavirus-associated hospitalization","wild-type rotavirus-positive children","effectiveness of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine","effectiveness of RotaTeq","resurgence of rotavirus activity","high rotavirus vaccine coverage","impact of RotaTeq","older unvaccinated children","post-NIP seasons","years of follow-up","prevalent wild-type rotavirus genotypes","prospective surveillance study of children","Finland","major impact","prevaccination seasons","all-cause gastroenteritis","exclusive use of RotaTeq","gastroenteritis viruses","acute gastroenteritis","Hospital discharge records","crude estimate","National Immunization Programme","Vaccine-derived rotaviruses","major reduction","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","stool samples","cases","case-control design","probable causal association","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","BACKGROUND","introduction","change","KEY POINTS","controls","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","hospitals","confidence interval","objective","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This suggests that a host switch is more probable if a potential host is closely related to the original host than if it is a more distant relative. However, despite its importance for the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife, the detailed dynamics of preferential host switching have, so far, been little studied. We present an empirical test of two theoretical models of preferential host switching, using observed phylogenetic distributions of host species for RNA viruses of three mammal orders (primates, carnivores, and ungulates). The analysis focuses on multihost RNA virus species, because their presence on multiple hosts and their estimated ages of origin indicate recent host switching. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to compare observed phylogenetic distances between hosts with those simulated under the theoretical models. The results support a decreasing sigmoidal model of preferential host switching, with a strong effect from increasing phylogenetic distance, on all three studied host phylogenies. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching are fundamentally similar for RNA viruses of different mammal orders and, potentially, a wider range of coevolutionary systems.","publish_time":"2013-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuthill, Jennifer Hoyal; Charleston, Michael A.","journal":"Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/361a027022a7865dad9347401b1f8374159d2eb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550750/; https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynamics of host switching","recent host","potential host","original host","theoretical models of preferential host","studied host phylogenies","detailed dynamics of preferential host","observed phylogenetic distributions of host species","decreasing sigmoidal model of preferential host","short phylogenetic distances","RNA viruses of different mammal orders","multihost RNA virus species","multiple hosts","presence","estimated ages of origin","wildlife","primates","tendency","pathogens","strong effect","livestock","carnivores","analysis","parasites","growing number of studies","health of humans","empirical test","wider range of coevolutionary systems","results","Approximate Bayesian computation","importance","ungulates"],"language":"en"},

Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Key Findings The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. Conclusion In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zanardo, Moreno; Chiara Martini, MSc; Monti, Caterina Beatrice; Cattaneo, Federica; Ciaralli, Carmine; Cornacchione, Patrizia; Durante, Stefano","journal":"Radiography (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51293df19546aee2ddbfe2c09a128177771458ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340912/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817420300626; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817420300626?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","confirmed COVID","dedicated COVID","management of suspected","CT imaging","equipment","cases","pandemic","isolated imaging room","sanitation of radiology room","management of radiographic","CT scanners","radiology service","department staff members","disposable protective gear","use of personal protective devices","special precautions","crucial role of diagnostic testing","robust plan","planning","guidance","complete synthesis of approaches","transmission","World Health Organization","contamination","radiography","technical note","Key Findings","months","consideration","incidence","paper","cleaning","Implications","aim","limited availability of supplies","novel coronavirus","Conclusion","professionals","Abstract Objectives","speed","deaths","China"],"language":"en"},

Piglets were inoculated with PRCV and 24 h later with S. aureus LTA. Clinical signs, lung virus titres, inflammatory cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were compared with those of animals in PRCV- and LTA- inoculated control groups. All PRCV-LTA inoculated pigs except one developed severe respiratory disease, whereas clinical signs in the control groups were minimal or absent. Virus titres and grossly visible pulmonary lesions were similar in the PRCV-LTA- and PRCV-inoculated groups and were not detected in the LTA-group. Neutrophil percentages in BALF were higher in the PRCV-LTA than in the PRCV group. There was no significant difference in interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12/IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 concentrations in BALF between the PRCV-LTA and PRCV groups, but levels of IL-6, IL-12/IL-23 and IFN-\u03B3 were higher in the PRCV-LTA-inoculated than in the LTA-inoculated controls. The findings suggest that the experimentally-induced respiratory disease was not mediated by cytokine over-production, but rather reflected the concerted action of particular cytokine interactions and/or as yet unidentified mediators. This is the first in vivo study to report the synergistic interaction between a virus and LTA in enhancing the severity of respiratory disease in the pig. Given that Gram-positive bacteria, capable of producing LTA, are commonly found in pig accommodation, the role of this compound in the development of the porcine respiratory disease complex requires further investigation.","publish_time":"2011-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atanasova, Kalina; Van Gucht, Steven; Barb\u00E9, Filip; Duchateau, Luc; Van Reeth, Kristien","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/664cd72990e2a871264100a81acdb4e3c5c31c1c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/db6e3b9c66d528a48f4816ebceb16e6c263f45b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2932768.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023310000845; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023310000845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20409735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRCV","LTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRCV-LTA inoculated pigs","PRCV groups","aureus LTA","PRCV-inoculated groups","LTA-group","LTA-inoculated controls","LTA- inoculated control groups","severity of respiratory disease","levels of IL","porcine respiratory disease complex","developed severe respiratory disease","porcine respiratory coronavirus","BALF","Clinical signs","lung virus titres","IFN-\u03B3","study","infected pigs","Staphylococcus aureus","pig accommodation","cytokine over-production","concerted action of particular cytokine interactions","inflammatory cells","cytokines","TNF","development","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","visible pulmonary lesions","\u03B1 concentrations","tumour necrosis factor","role","compound","interferon","synergistic interaction","investigation","significant difference","Neutrophil percentages","Gram-positive bacteria","lipoteichoic acid","interleukin","animals","unidentified mediators","objective","Piglets","lipopolysaccharide","findings"],"language":"en"},

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a pro-inflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-\u03BAB-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-\u03BAB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history \u2013 in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.","publish_time":"2019-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanz, Joaquin; Maurizio, Paul L.; Snyder-Mackler, Noah; Simons, Noah D.; Voyles, Tawni; Kohn, Jordan; Michopoulos, Vasiliki; Wilson, Mark; Tung, Jenny; Barreiro, Luis B.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8c2466863d8ff87bc1aaf5218ce6f3f7fb29c3b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4e98e3f927d24097e26f5970e2127c215feb6402.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/552356","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of social status","current social status","social history","long-term social status","past social status","social subordination","Social experiences","social mammals","social hierarchy","support of social experience","Chronic social stress","gene expression response","Status-driven gene expression patterns","lower expression of genes","higher expression of genes","low status drives","exaggerated expression","immune cell gene expression","immune response","antiviral response","subset of genes","IFN-associated genes","NF-\u03BAB","pathogen type","pro-inflammatory state","innate immune system","dependent pro-inflammatory pathways","pathogen exposure","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","antiviral defense","interaction effects","viral challenge","current models","unstimulated cells","viral mimic Gardiquimod","elevated antibacterial defenses","survival","female rhesus macaques","reduced investment","important predictor of disease susceptibility","humans","biological embedding","adulthood","memory","predictions","time of sampling","females","interferon","rank","Counter","results"],"language":"en"},

Intuitively, one may hypothesize that those synonymous mutations which increase the tAI values are favored by natural selection. RESULTS: We use the maize (Zea mays) genome to test our assumption. The first supporting evidence is that the tAI-increasing synonymous mutations have higher fixed-to-polymorphic ratios than the tAI-decreasing ones. Next, the DAF (derived allele frequency) or MAF (minor allele frequency) of the former is significantly higher than the latter. Moreover, similar results are obtained when we investigate CAI (codon adaptation index) instead of tAI. CONCLUSION: The synonymous mutations in the maize genome are not strictly neutral. The tAI-increasing mutations are positively selected while those tAI-decreasing ones undergo purifying selection. This selection force might be weak but should not be automatically ignored.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Duan; Wei, Lai","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14a2f85aa6d69af9e54a25a69ecc03ceebdf6ae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190201.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6745-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Synonymous mutations","tAI values","codon adaptation index","maize genome","ones","minor allele frequency","derived allele frequency","tRNA adaptation index","purifying selection","selection force","similar results","MAF","polymorphic ratios","CAI","Zea mays","DAF","BACKGROUND","local translation rate","assumption","supporting evidence","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Previously we showed that PHB2 interacts with Akt and inhibits muscle differentiation by repressing the transcriptional activity of both MyoD and MEF2. Here we show that Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMK IV) specifically binds to the C terminus of PHB2 and phosphorylates PHB2 at serine 91. Ectopic expression of CaMK IV and PHB2 in C2C12 cells results effectively in decreased PHB2-mediated repression of MEF2-dependent gene expression. Conversely, PHB2 mutant (S91A) resistant to CaMK IV phosphorylation has less effective in relieving the inhibition of MEF2 transcription by PHB2. Our findings suggest that CaMK IV interacts with and regulates PHB2 through phosphorylation, which could be one of the mechanisms underlying the CaMK-mediated activation of MEF2.","publish_time":"2011-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Luguo; Cao, Xia; Liu, Bin; Huang, Honglan; Wang, Xu; Sui, Liyan; Yin, Weimin; Ma, Kewei","journal":"Cell Signal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127762.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089865681100177X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089865681100177X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21689744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CaMK IV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHB2 mutant","CaMK IV","various functions of PHB2","C terminus of PHB2","decreased PHB2-mediated repression of MEF2","CaMK-mediated activation of MEF2","Ectopic expression of CaMK","Calmodulin-dependent kinase IV","inhibition of MEF2 transcription","mechanisms","phosphorylation","dependent gene expression","various cellular compartments","transcriptional activity","S91A","resistant","C2C12 cells","muscle differentiation","Calcium","multifunctional protein","nucleus","MyoD","Akt","findings","serine","Prohibitin"],"language":"en"},

In this study, 12 sets of nested primers covering the SARS-CoV genome have been screened and showed sufficient sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV in RNA isolated from virus cultured in Vero 6 cells. To optimize further the reaction condition of those nested primers sets, seven sets of nested primers have been chosen to compare their reverse transcribed efficiency with specific and random primers, which is useful to combine RT with the first round of PCR into a one-step RT-PCR. Based on the sensitivity and simplicity of results, the no. 73 primer set was chosen as the candidate primer set for clinical diagnoses. To specify the amplicon to minimize false positive results, a Taqman RT-nested PCR system of no. 73 nested primer set was developed. Through investigations on a test panel of whole blood obtained from 30 SARS patients and 9 control persons, the specificity and sensitivity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system was found to be 100 and 83%, respectively, which suggests that the method is a promising one to diagnose SARS in early stages.","publish_time":"2004-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Qingfa; Xu, Zuyuan; Wei, Tian; Zeng, Haipang; Li, Jingxiang; Gang, Haixue; Sun, Min; Jiang, Fangbo; Wang, Xiang; Dong, Wei; Yang, Ling; Wang, Jian","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa7efebcda313f717da4b56f4b846b0eaad002f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119531.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093404000497; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093404000497","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Vero","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","sets of nested primers","Taqman RT-nested PCR system of","SARS-CoV genome","nested primer set","one-step RT-PCR","SARS-associated coronavirus","etiologic agent of SARS","round of PCR","random primers","candidate primer","sufficient sensitivity","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","reaction condition","simplicity of results","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","false positive results","reverse transcribed efficiency","emerged infectious respiratory illness","control persons","specificity","blood","RNA","test panel","Vero","amplicon","clinical diagnoses","assays","study","early stages","investigations","cells","method"],"language":"en"},

Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (SARC-CoV-2 M(pro)) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and molecular electrostatic potential. (Z)-3-(4\u2032-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4-one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibits the replication and transcription of the virus and, ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveals that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examined in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of SARC-CoV-2 M(pro), for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity and effective pharmacological properties.

We solved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on dynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: i, anatomizing the whole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential patches; ii, inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each patch via maximum likelihood estimation; iii, recovering the whole process by assembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in parameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory, we introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an invasion pathway can be identified.

While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe \u00F4m). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi\u0027s xe \u00F4m drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe \u00F4m drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security.

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing. Changes in the immune response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals are very likely to be the main factors involved in the association between viral infection and asthma.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Garcia, M.

METHODS: We collected 626 surface swabs within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major PPE. The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%).

To elucidate the anti-ZIKV effect of lycorine, we used reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, Western western blot, and plaque forming assay to analyse viral RNA (vRNA), viral protein, progeny virus counts, and validated inhibitors in vitro using a variety of cell lines. Additionally, we found that lycorine acts post-infection according to time-of-addition assay, and inhibits RdRp activity. Lycorine protected AG6 mice against ZIKV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the blood.

It has been known for some time that influenza virions contain nine viral proteins; however, analyses of other enveloped viruses have revealed that proteins from the host cell can also be detected in virions. To address whether the same is true for influenza virus, we used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles. In addition to the aforementioned nine virus-encoded proteins, we detected the presence of 36 host-encoded proteins. These include both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound proteins that can be grouped into several functional categories, such as cytoskeletal proteins, annexins, glycolytic enzymes, and tetraspanins. Interestingly, a significant number of these have also been reported to be present in virions of other virus families. Protease treatment of virions combined with immunoblot analysis was used to verify the presence of the cellular protein and also to determine whether it is located in the core of the influenza virus particle. Immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of membrane-bound host proteins on the influenza virus envelope. The identification of cellular constituents of influenza virions has important implications for understanding the interactions of influenza virus with its host and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for influenza virus replication. While not all of the host proteins are necessarily incorporated specifically, those that are and are found to have an essential role represent novel targets for antiviral drugs and for attenuation of viruses for vaccine purposes.","publish_time":"2008-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Megan L.; Stone, Kathryn L.; Colangelo, Christopher M.; Gulcicek, Erol E.; Palese, Peter","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/578d296ec1f6acc01c08cc5a9861bac6d47ddfda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2390764.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535660/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Immunogold"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-encoded proteins","influenza virus replication","interactions of influenza virus","influenza virus envelope","bound host proteins","host-encoded proteins","essential proteins","virus egress","cytoskeletal proteins","virus families","viral proteins","host cell","membrane-bound proteins","identification of cellular constituents of influenza virions","comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles","Protease treatment of virions","presence of membrane","cellular requirements","cellular protein","target cell","initiation of replication","attenuation of viruses","essential role","enveloped viruses","antiviral drugs","important implications","novel targets","complementary mass spectrometry approaches","annexins","glycolytic enzymes","analyses","step closer","tetraspanins","vaccine purposes","functional categories","time","core","Immunogold","addition","significant number"],"language":"en"},

The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.

Moreover, the clinical manifestation of ZIKV infection has apparently changed, as evident by increasing reports of neurological complications, such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome in adults and congenital anomalies in neonates. We comprehensively compared the genome sequences of pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV strains with complete genome or complete polyprotein sequences available in GenBank. Besides the reported phylogenetic clustering of the epidemic strains with the Asian lineage, we found that the topology of phylogenetic tree of all coding regions is the same except that of the non-structural 2B (NS2B) coding region. This finding was confirmed by bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignment, which suggested the presence of a fragment of genetic recombination at NS2B with that of Spondweni virus. Moreover, the representative epidemic strain possesses one large bulge of nine bases instead of an external loop on the first stem-loop structure at the 3\u2032-untranslated region just distal to the stop codon of the NS5 in the 1947 pre-epidemic prototype strain. Fifteen amino acid substitutions are found in the epidemic strains when compared with the pre-epidemic strains. As mutations in other flaviviruses can be associated with changes in virulence, replication efficiency, antigenic epitopes and host tropism, further studies would be important to ascertain the biological significance of these genomic changes.","publish_time":"2016-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zheng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Tee, Kah-Meng; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Lau, Susanna Kar-Pui; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Tse, Herman; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4f1ccfcf8b71a2828f39991e67142dd3a57fd1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4820678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26980239/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.48","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Africa","Pacific","Asia"],"keyphrases":["epidemic ZIKV strains","pre-epidemic strains","genome sequences of pre-epidemic","representative epidemic strain","pre-epidemic prototype strain","complete genome","NS2B","clinical manifestation of ZIKV infection","reported phylogenetic clustering","complete polyprotein sequences available","large bulge","untranslated region","coding regions","Spondweni virus","genomic changes","external loop","large outbreaks","topology of phylogenetic tree","stem-loop structure","sporadic cases of human Zika virus","antigenic epitopes","replication efficiency","adults","host tropism","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","bootscan analysis","presence","congenital anomalies","Guillain","virulence","NS5","multiple sequence alignment","stop codon","fragment of genetic recombination","reports of neurological complications","studies","biological significance","bases","GenBank","Asian lineage","neonates","amino acid substitutions","Africa","populations","Pacific islands","finding","flaviviruses","mutations","Americas"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we characterized the complete S1 gene from 120 IBVs circulating in chickens in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene of 120 Thai IBVs revealed that the 2014\u20132016 Thai IBVs were divided into 3 lineages (GI-1, GI-13, and GI-19) and a novel IBV variant. Our results also showed that GI-19 lineage has become the predominant lineage of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. It is interesting to note that a novel IBV variant, which was genetically different from the established IBV lineages, was identified in this study. The recombination analysis demonstrated that this novel IBV variant was a recombinant virus, which was originated from the GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant in chicken flocks in Thailand.

In this study, we describe the development of a resequencing pathogen microarray (RPM-IVDC4) method for the simultaneous detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites that cause CNSI. The test panel of this assay included more than 100 microorganism species across 45 genera and 30 families. The analytical specificity and sensitivity were examined using a panel of positive reference strains, and the clinical performance was evaluated using 432 clinical samples by comparing the results with q-PCR assays. Our results demonstrated good performance of the RPM-IVDC4 assay in terms of sensitivity, specificity and detection range, suggesting that the platform can be further developed for high-throughput CNSI diagnosis.

COVID-19 patients frequently require mechanical support for adequate oxygenation. A severe shortfall of ventilators is predicted. Of equal concern is the projected shortage of trained professionals required to care for patients on mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography is proving to be a valuable tool for identifying the pulmonary manifestations and progression of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound also facilitates successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography of the lung, pleura and diaphragm are easily mastered by experienced echocardiographers. Echocardiography has an established role for optimal fluid management and recognition of cardiac disease including SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy. Cardiologists, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and all providers should be prepared to commit their full spectrum of skills to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. We should also be prepared to collaborate and cross-train to expand professional services as necessary.

The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy. Method We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS. Results Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy. Conclusion Despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Momattin, Hisham; Al-Ali, Anfal Y.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a6f2e1a09c7bf12adb288a9adaa9925d158da5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110863.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.06.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893919301097; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893919301097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Science Direct"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","human therapy of MERS","treatment of MERS","multiple studies","randomized clinical trials","articles","combination of lopinavir","study","interferon-beta","specific therapy","optimal therapy","recommended therapy","clinical settings","number of observational studies","Embase","Science Direct","humans","ritonavir","MEDLINE","randomized control trial","therapeutic aroma","animal models","excellent results","potential benefit","potential therapies","promising therapeutic agents","multiple healthcare associated outbreaks","human polyclonal IgG antibody","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Scopus databases","Abstract Background","old drugs","SAB","great international attention","consensus","common marmosets","disease","high case fatality rate","relevant papers","consideration","interesting strategy","healthy individuals","horizon","inclusions","exclusions criteria","experience","Method","Conclusion","Initial search","final review","testing","efficacy","investigation","order","randomization","completion","Ribavirin"],"language":"en"},

The polyprotein has been proposed to encode three proteinase domains which are responsible for the processing of the polyprotein into mature proteins. The proteolytic activity of the first proteinase domain has been characterized and resembles the papain family of cysteine proteinases. This proteinase domain acts autoproteolytically to cleave the amino terminal portion of the polymerase polyprotein, releasing a 28-kDa protein designated p28. To identify the cleavage site of this papain-like cysteine proteinase, we isolated the peptide adjacent to p28 and determined the amino terminus sequence by Edman degradation reaction. We report that proteolysis occurs between the Gly-247 and Val-248 dipeptide bond. To determine the role of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage site, we introduced a total of 42 site-specific mutations at the residues spanning the P5 to P3\u2032 positions and assessed the effects of the mutations on the processing of p28 in an in vitro transcription and translation system. The substitutions of Gly-247 at the P1 position or Arg-246 at the P2 position resulted in a dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity, and the mutations of Arg-243 at P5 position also led to considerable reduction in p28 cleavage. In contrast, the substitutions of amino acids Gly-244 (P4), Tyr-245 (P3), Val-248 (P1\u2032), Lys-249 (P2\u2032), and Pro-250 (P3\u2032) had little or no effect on the amount of p26 that was released. This work has identified Gly-247-Val-248 as the cleavage site for the release of p28, the amino-terminal protein of the murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein. Additionally, we conclude that the Gly-247 and Arg-246 are the major determinants for the cleavage site recognition by the first papain-like cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus.","publish_time":"1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Shanghong; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284715674; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284715674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p28 cleavage","processing of p28","murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein","cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus","substitutions of Gly","cleavage site recognition","substitutions of amino acids Gly","amino-terminal protein","release of p28","mutations of Arg","proteinase domains","P3","Val","amino terminal portion","amino acid residues","proteinase domain acts","murine coronavirus polymerase gene","P5 position","kDa protein designated p28","P2 position","P1 position","amino terminus sequence","papain family of cysteine proteinases","site-specific mutations","dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity","Edman degradation reaction","major determinants","considerable reduction","transcription","effects","P4","total","peptide adjacent","length","positions","mature proteins","contrast","role","translation system","dipeptide bond","Tyr","potential","p26","proteolysis","work"],"language":"en"},

Results The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes. Conclusions Suggestions are made on the possible pathological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussain, Akhtar; Bhowmik, Bishwajit; Cristina do Vale Moreira, Nayla","journal":"Diabetes Res Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62c692fa56138dbf3dbd03b6244a70d797ec83fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144611.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720303922; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108142; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720303922?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes","clinical spectrum of COVID","SARS-CoV","clinical management","relationship","people","clinical features","discontinuation of angiotensin","novel coronavirus","coronavirus disease","underlying mechanisms","Conclusions Suggestions","conclusive evidence","definite conclusions","potential hypoglycemic events","angiotensin receptor blockers","possible pathological mechanisms","current limited evidence","potential direct pancreatic damage","immune response impairment","acute respiratory distress syndrome","rigorous glucose monitoring","increased coagulation activity","careful consideration of drug interactions","multiple organ failure","symptoms","ACEI","therapeutic strategies","enzyme inhibitors","articles","PubMed","comorbidities","mild flu","Chronic inflammation","use of chloroquine","Google Scholar databases","Patient","death","transmission","association","significant predictors of morbidity","adverse outcomes","general characteristics","better understanding","pathogenesis","incubation period","mortality","diagnosis","interposition","Older age","following keywords","Boolean operator","subjects","Methods","Caution","treatment","infection","research","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.

This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs)2. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. We report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to IEs without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analyzing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA level, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the gDNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camel-like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientation and frame compatible with expression. Collectively, these results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against IEs and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pieper, Kathrin; Tan, Joshua; Piccoli, Luca; Foglierini, Mathilde; Barbieri, Sonia; Chen, Yiwei; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Wolf, Tobias; Jarrossay, David; Anderle, Marica; Abdi, Abdirahman; Ndungu, Francis M.; Doumbo, Ogobara K.; Traore, Boubacar; Tran, Tuan M.; Jongo, Said; Zenklusen, Isabelle; Crompton, Peter D.; Daubenberger, Claudia; Bull, Peter C.; Sallusto, Federica; Lanzavecchia, Antonio","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf73a62e8d870d8edd2bd1fb2ca68424e2e8b7d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5635981.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28847005/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23670","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAIR1 domain","LAIR1 exon","extracellular domain of LAIR1","additional LAIR1 insertions","different modalities of LAIR1 insertion","high levels of LAIR1","reactive antibodies","dominant antibodies","production of bispecific antibodies","insertion modality","febrile malaria","malaria infection","European blood donors","insertion of templated DNA","malaria-endemic regions","malaria-exposed individuals","additional mechanism of antibody diversification","B cell clones","B cell engineering","DJ segments","VH","immune response","CH1 domains","switch regions of memory B cells","gDNA level","exon shuffling","frequent templated inserts","large cohorts of individuals","orientation","transcribed genes","RIFINs","protein","surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes","flanking intronic sequences","exons","rare cases","cDNA","plasma","pathogens","enhanced protection","collagen","type of variant antigen","somatic mutations","frame compatible","results","elbow","inhibitory receptor","expression","Sequencing","camel","chromosome"],"language":"en"},

The disease is common throughout the world where chickens are produced commercially. PCR on reverse transcribed RNA is a potent technique for the detection of IBV. In comparison with classical detection methods, PCR-based techniques are both sensitive and fast. Dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been detected, and many more will surely be reported in future. This research was conducted to identify the infectious bronchitis virus with group specific primers of avian Coronaviruses in Zabol, southeast of Iran. Tracheal swabs were collected from eleven commercial broiler flocks and these swabs were used for RNA extraction. General primers included XCE2\u002B and XCE2- that amplify all IBV serotypes were used. Primers MCE1\u002B, BCE1\u002B and DCE1\u002B was used to amplifying the specific nucleotide sequence of Massachusetts, 4/91 and D274 serotypes, respectively. The results of this study showed that 36.36% of the sampled flocks were positive to IBV by RT-PCR. Moreover, the Massachusetts was the identified serotype of infectious bronchitis virus. The results provide the first molecular evidence for the presence of infectious bronchitis virus and Massachusetts serotype in Zabol.

We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents, and non-communicable diseases, including thermal disorders. In the events discussed in this Review, the combination of a large influx of people, many from countries with outbreak-prone infectious diseases, with a high degree of crowd interactions imposed substantial burdens on host countries\u0027 health systems. The detection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj raise concern of possible globalisation from mass-gathering religious events.

Despite extensive characterization of PRRSV proteins by direct analysis and comparison with other arteriviruses, determinants of virulence, pathogenesis and protective immune recognition remain poorly understood. Thus, we hypothesized that additional ORFs are present in the PRRSV genome that may contribute to its biological properties, and so we screened highly purified virions of strain VR2332, the prototype type 2 PRRSV, for evidence of novel polypeptides. A 51 aa polypeptide was discovered that is encoded by an alternative ORF of the subgenomic mRNA encoding the major envelope glycoprotein, GP5, and which is incorporated into virions. The protein, referred to as ORF5a protein, is expressed in infected cells, and pigs infected with PRRSV express anti-ORF5a protein antibodies. A similar ORF is present as an alternative reading frame in all PRRSV subgenomic RNA5 genes and in all other arteriviruses, suggesting that this ORF5a protein plays a significant role in arterivirology.

Respiratory viral infections are key components in predisposing cattle to the development of this disease. To quantify the contribution of four viruses commonly associated with BRD, a case-control study was conducted nested within the National Bovine Respiratory Disease Initiative project population in Australian feedlot cattle. Effects of exposure to Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), and to combinations of these viruses, were investigated. Based on weighted seroprevalences at induction (when animals were enrolled and initial samples collected), the percentages of the project population estimated to be seropositive were 24% for BoHV-1, 69% for BVDV-1, 89% for BRSV and 91% for BPIV-3. For each of the four viruses, seropositivity at induction was associated with reduced risk of BRD (OR: 0.6\u20130.9), and seroincrease from induction to second blood sampling (35\u201360 days after induction) was associated with increased risk of BRD (OR: 1.3\u20131.5). Compared to animals that were seropositive for all four viruses at induction, animals were at progressively increased risk with increasing number of viruses for which they were seronegative; those seronegative for all four viruses were at greatest risk (OR: 2.4). Animals that seroincreased for one or more viruses from induction to second blood sampling were at increased risk (OR: 1.4\u20132.1) of BRD compared to animals that did not seroincrease for any viruses. Collectively these results confirm that prior exposure to these viruses is protective while exposure at or after feedlot entry increases the risk of development of BRD in feedlots. However, the modest increases in risk associated with seroincrease for each virus separately, and the progressive increases in risk with multiple viral exposures highlights the importance of concurrent infections in the aetiology of the BRD complex. These findings indicate that, while efficacious vaccines could aid in the control of BRD, vaccination against one of these viruses would not have large effects on population BRD incidence but vaccination against multiple viruses would be expected to result in greater reductions in incidence. The findings also confirm the multifactorial nature of BRD development, and indicate that multifaceted approaches in addition to efficacious vaccines against viruses will be required for substantial reductions in BRD incidence.","publish_time":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hay, K.

We evaluated NDV as a vector for expressing selected antigens of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. A series of recombinant NDVs were generated that expressed intracellular or extracellular forms of two Borrelia burgdorferi antigens: namely, the basic membrane protein A (BmpA) and the outer surface protein C (OspC). Expression of the intracellular and extracellular forms of these antigens was confirmed in cultured chicken cells. C3H or Balb/C mice that were immunized intranasally with the NDV vectors mounted vigorous serum antibody responses against the NDV vector, but failed to mount a robust response against either the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA or OspC. In contrast, a single immunization of hamsters with the NDV vectors via the intranasal, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal route resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA and OspC. When groups of hamsters were separately inoculated with various NDV vectors and challenged with B. burgdorferi (10(8) cells/animal), immunization with vector expressing either intracellular or extracellular BmpA was associated with a significant reduction of the pathogen load in the joints. Taken together, our studies highlighted the importance of NDV as vaccine vector that can be used for simple yet effective immunization of hosts against bacterial infections including Lyme disease.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Sa; Kumar, Manish; Yang, Xiuli; Akkoyunlu, Mustafa; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.; Pal, Utpal","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22f1766a29396444ca55e944cb8afca66021dd9f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/51a5319303e2d4ec0191b060a38d661e17103fd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3138909.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11007080; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3138909?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11007080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21600949/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. burgdorferi"],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular BmpA","extracellular forms of BmpA","importance of NDV","various NDV vectors","OspC","Borrelia burgdorferi antigens","potential vaccine vector","Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi","selected antigens","single immunization of hamsters","Newcastle disease virus","rigorous antibody responses","effective immunization of hosts","vigorous serum antibody responses","pathogen load","outer surface protein C","avian virus","C mice","groups of hamsters","basic membrane protein","cultured chicken cells","bacterial infections","intraperitoneal route","primates","significant reduction","human use","C3H","Balb","contrast","animal","Expression","series of recombinant NDVs","robust response","joints","studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection.

Since its emergence, a total of 2279 patients from 27 countries have been infected across the globe according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report (Feb. 12th, 2019). Approximately 806 patients have died. The virus uses its spike proteins as adhesive factors that are proinflammatory for host entry through a specific receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). This receptor is considered a key factor in the signaling and activation of the acquired and innate immune responses in infected patients. Using potent antigens in combination with strong adjuvants may effectively trigger the activation of specific MERS-CoV cellular responses as well as the production of neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective approved treatment or vaccine for MERS-CoV. Thus, there are urgent needs for the development of novel MERS-CoV therapies as well as vaccines to help minimize the spread of the virus from infected patients, thereby mitigating the risk of any potential pandemics. Our main goals are to highlight and describe the current knowledge of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to MERS-CoV and the current state of MERS-CoV vaccine development. We believe this study will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that enhance the MERS-CoV immune response and subsequently contribute to the control of MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mubarak, Ayman; Alturaiki, Wael; Hemida, Maged Gomaa","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f8beb2781bb92d1e2fffd8361b1feec3fd834e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6476043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089478/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/6491738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV immune response","control of MERS","CoV infections","development of novel MERS-CoV therapies","activation of specific MERS-CoV cellular responses","CoV vaccine development","current state of MERS","infected patients","innate immune responses","adaptive immune responses","specific receptor","current knowledge","adhesive factors","proinflammatory","host entry","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","strong adjuvants","effective approved treatment","spike proteins","dipeptidyl peptidase","World Health Organization","globe","potent antigens","combination","risk","spread","urgent needs","report","total","countries","key factor","vaccines","mechanisms","production of neutralizing antibodies","understanding","potential pandemics","DPP4","date","emergence","main goals","study"],"language":"en"},

Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health.","publish_time":"2018-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fonseca, Jo\u00E3o Pedro; Bonny, Alain R.; Kumar, G.

These results demonstrate that the HR2P peptide and anti-HR2P antibody can serve as a tool for dissecting the fusion mechanism of PEDV, guiding the search for potent inhibitors with therapeutic value against PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Pengwei; Wang, Bin; Ji, Chun-Miao; Cong, Xiaoyan; Wang, Ming; Huang, Yao-Wei","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed728db4ecf5d0d74cbde49b31926aa5a0d51da6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113693.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217305922; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217305922; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.11.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29203391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HR2P peptide","immunization of HR2P","HR regions","Peptides","fusion mechanism of PEDV","anti-HR2P antibody","antibodies capable of neutralizing PEDV infection","infection assays","potent inhibitors","HR1","process of virus fusion","potential competitive inhibitors","glycoproteins of enveloped viruses","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","search","mice","therapeutic value","conserved motifs","spike glycoprotein S2 subunit","Abstract Heptad repeat","tool","helix bundle structure","HR2M","HR2L","study","analysis","results","Escherichia coli","viral entry"],"language":"en"},

Our present study investigated whether cinnamon water extract (CWE) may influence the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and the activity of macrophage scavenger receptors, commonly observed in atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: We investigated the effect of CWE on the expression of various surface markers and the uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated THP-1 cells. The protein levels of PMA or macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-stimulated type 1 macrophage scavenger receptor (SRA) were analyzed. Finally, the role of extracellar signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 in SRA synthesis and the effect of CWE on PMA-stimulated ERK1/2 were determined. RESULTS: CWE inhibited the differentiation of monocyte by decreasing the expression of CD11b, CD36 and SRA and the uptake of acetyl LDL. CWE suppressed the upregulation of SRA by M-CSF and modulated ERK1/2 activity, which was required for PMA-induced SRA synthesis.

The viruses attenuated by large-scale recoding have the added value that they are extremely genetically stable. However, the exact mechanisms that lead to viral attenuation by recoding are yet to be determined. SUMMARY: While the advantages of large-scale recoding (speed, simplicity, potency, and universal applicability) have been known for more than a decade, this approach has been only inadequately explored and the attention was focused on a limited number of RNA viruses. Attenuation of viruses by large-scale recoding should be explored to combat known and future viral threats.","publish_time":"2018-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Kunec, Dusan","journal":"Curr Clin Microbiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f88f221ea36386fe8fda722b4b46ba5aa1be7917.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226716/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-018-0080-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advantages of large-scale recoding","large-scale recoding of viral genomes","viral attenuation","Attenuation of viruses","current understanding of virus attenuation","future viral threats","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","limited number of RNA viruses","codon pair deoptimization","safer live modified virus vaccines","development of attenuated vaccine candidates","construction of better","simplicity","potency","speed","robust methods","added value","universal applicability","exact mechanisms","attention","SUMMARY","decade","approach","RECENT FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vl\u010Dkov\u00E1, Radoslava; Andrej\u010D\u00E1kov\u00E1, Zuzana; Sopkov\u00E1, Drahom\u00EDra; Hertelyov\u00E1, Zdenka; Kozio\u0142, Katarzyna; Koziorowski, Marek; Gancar\u010D\u00EDkov\u00E1, So\u0148a","journal":"Animal Reproduction Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76abaecc6cb07cb08ecaac9f7c1c2d85fb404270.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125862.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843201830099X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.04.066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843201830099X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["EPA","DHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of fatty acids","palmitoleic acids","effect of flaxseed","day of weaning","low levels of myristic","high levels of myristic","high levels of ALA","levels of steroid hormones","days post-weaning","influence of dietary flaxseed","increased levels of linoleic acid","apoptosis of ovarian follicles","inhibition of proliferation","higher proliferation","lower apoptosis","metabolism of selected fatty acids","EPA","stimulation of apoptosis","linolenic acid","DHA","ovarian functions of weanling gilts","IGF","action of probiotics","low level of eicosadienoic acid","dietary probiotic cheeses","reverse effect","beneficial effects","secondary follicles","blood samples","higher body weight","endocrine","Coronavirus infections","relation","possible mechanisms","modulation","coli","timodonic","insulin","growth factor","effective prebiotic","weanlings","follicle development","antibiotics","cervonic","conversion of alpha","natural substitution","cell cycle","gas chromatography","controls","immunoassays","study","organism","aim","data","ovaries"],"language":"en"},

Three frameworks for the use of vaccines in this context are described, and examples are provided of successes and failures. Framework I vaccines are used for protection of humans and economically valuable animals, where neither plays a role in the transmission cycle. The benefit of collaborations between animal health and human health industries and regulators in developing such products is discussed, and one example (West Nile vaccine) of a single product developed for use in animals and humans is described. Framework II vaccines are indicated for domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans. The agents of concern are transmitted directly or indirectly (e.g. via arthropod vectors) from animals to humans. A number of examples of the use of Framework II vaccines are provided, e.g. against brucellosis, Escherischia coli O157, rabies, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Hendra virus. Framework III vaccines are used to immunize wild animals as a means of preventing transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals. Examples are reservoir-targeted, oral bait rabies, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines. Given the speed and lost cost of veterinary vaccine development, some interventions based on the immunization of animals could lead to rapid and relatively inexpensive advances in public health. Opportunities for vaccine-based approaches to preventing zoonotic and emerging diseases that integrate veterinary and human medicine (the One Health paradigm) are emphasized.","publish_time":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monath, Thomas P.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85ea38dbeba7ee82244edfd40942043e4de2777d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060567/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1301270X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.09.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1301270X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domesticated animals","immunization of animals","valuable animals","wild animals","use of vaccines","use of Framework","Lyme disease vaccines","means","protection of humans","human health industries","animal health","human diseases","public health","Health paradigm","transmission of disease agents","human medicine","vaccine-based approaches","number of examples","West Nile vaccine","lost cost of veterinary vaccine development","emerging diseases","transmission cycle","agents of concern","oral bait rabies","Rift Valley fever","Venezuelan equine encephalitis","Mycobacterium bovis","Escherischia coli O157","reservoir-targeted","single product","brucellosis","regulators","interventions","Hendra virus","inexpensive advances","speed","benefit of collaborations","products","Opportunities","role","zoonoses","arthropod vectors","context","successes","failures","review","frameworks"],"language":"en"},

However, no prior studies have evaluated the effect of early anti-PCP treatment on clinical outcomes in HIV-negative patient with severe PCP. Therefore, this study investigated the association between the time to anti-PCP treatment and the clinical outcomes in HIV-negative patients with PCP who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed involving 51 HIV-negative patients with PCP who presented in respiratory failure and were admitted to the intensive care unit between October 2005 and July 2018. A logistic regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors in the association between the time to anti-PCP treatment and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: All patients were treated with appropriate anti-PCP treatment, primarily involving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The median time to anti-PCP treatment was 58.0 (28.0\u201397.8) hours. Thirty-one (60.8%) patients were treated empirically prior to confirmation of the microbiological diagnosis. However, the hospital mortality rates were not associated with increasing quartiles of time until anti-PCP treatment (P = 0.818, test for trend). In addition, hospital mortality of patients received early empiric treatment was not better than those of patients received definitive treatment after microbiologic diagnosis (48.4% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.765). In a multiple logistic regression model, the time to anti-PCP treatment was not associated with increased mortality. However, age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.14) and failure to initial treatment (adjusted OR 13.03, 95% CI 2.34\u201372.65) were independently associated with increased mortality.

Since first reported in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV has been subsequently detected in USA, South Korea, Thailand, and mainland China. Here we isolated a strain of PDCoV, named CHN-GD-2016, from the intestinal content of a diseased newborn piglet with severe diarrhea in a pig farm in Guangdong, China. PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 could be identified by immunofluorescence with PDCoV specific rabbit antisera, and typical crown-shaped particles with spiky surface projections of this PDCoV were observed with electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 was closely related to other Chinese PDCoV strains, with the highest sequence similarity with the strain CHN/Tianjin/2016. Importantly, inoculation of newborn piglets with 1 \u00D7 10(5) TCID(50) of CHN-GD-2016 by oral feeding successfully reproduced clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in piglets. In addition, the virus RNA in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation was detected, macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed, and viral antigen was also detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the data show in this study confirms that PDCoV is present in Guangdong, China and is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets.","publish_time":"2018-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhichao; Zhong, Huiling; Zhou, Qingfeng; Du, Yunping; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yun; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Virologica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0800afe623d2700bfe1225d91e657dc8d2b59d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6178105.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12250-018-0003-8.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569144/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-018-0003-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","South Korea","Thailand","China"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV CHN-GD","strain of PDCoV","Chinese PDCoV strains","strain CHN","inoculation of newborn piglets","PDCoV specific rabbit antisera","severe diarrhea","watery diarrhea","diseased newborn piglet","Guangdong","mainland China","identified virus","pig farm","pig industry","virus RNA","small intestines","days post inoculation","typical crown-shaped particles","results","significant economic losses","highest sequence similarity","vomiting","spiky surface projections","dehydration","clear clinical symptoms","oral feeding","rectal swabs","Thailand","South Korea","microscopic lesions","intestinal content","USA","immunofluorescence","immunohistochemical staining","viral antigen","addition","study","Tianjin","Genomic analysis","Porcine deltacoronavirus","Hong Kong","electron microscopy","data","TCID"],"language":"en"},

In this study, high titered mouse antisera against the N-terminal globular (S1) and S2 subunits of the S protein were generated and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from these antisera. The efficiency of these purified IgGs in virus neutralization and blocking of receptor binding were compared quantitatively using virus neutralization assay and a previously developed cell-based receptor binding assay, respectively. We demonstrated that anti-S1 IgG neutralizes the virus and binds to the membrane associated S protein more efficiently than anti-S2 IgG does. Moreover, both anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency. The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry. On the other hand, the functional roles of the previously reported neutralizing epitopes within S2 subunit were investigated using an antigen specific antibody depletion assay. Depletion of antibodies against these regions significantly diminished, though not completely abolished, the neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG. It suggests the absence of a major neutralizing domain on S2 protein. The possible ways of anti-S2 IgGs to abolish the receptor binding and the factors restricting anti-S2 IgGs to neutralize the virus are discussed.","publish_time":"2006-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Fanya; Hon, Chung Chau; Yip, Chi Wai; Law, Ka Man; Yeung, Yin Shan; Chan, Kwok Hung; Malik Peiris, Joseph S.; Leung, Frederick Chi Ching","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f349e5479fd86ad262294d666fb88c323af65786.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9115f3c9be874d41c7f9f31bc7e54ab2a92d6aa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094555.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579306010799; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579306010799","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S2 protein","neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG","anti-S1 IgG","S2 subunits","possible ways of anti-S2","unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG","S protein","virus neutralization assay","cellular receptor","developed cell-based receptor binding assay","Neutralizing effects of antibodies","neutralizing epitopes","major neutralizing domain","Depletion of antibodies","higher blocking efficiency","spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","antigen specific antibody depletion assay","possible role","N-terminal globular","C-terminal stalk","high titered mouse antisera","process","total immunoglobulin G","study","factors","current hypothesis of viral entry","functional roles","absence","membrane","hand","regions","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Features of infection in immunosuppressed adults are poorly characterised. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the epidemiology of HRV-C in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients in a single centre. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of all HSCT recipients admitted to Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia from 1 July 2005 to 30 September 2007 was undertaken. Nose/throat samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission and patients developing pre-defined symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection during the admission. Samples were processed and tested for rhinoviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses using nucleic acid-based methods, immunofluorescence and culture. HRV genotyping was performed by sequencing a region of the rhinovirus 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Clinical data on each episode were collected prospectively. RESULTS: HRVs were identified in 24 episodes: 8% of 299 episodes of clinically- defined respiratory infections and 39% of 61 episodes in which respiratory viruses were detected. HRV-C was most frequent (HRV-C: nine, HRV-A: eight and HRV-B: two). Seven episodes of HRV-C, five with pneumonia, occurred within 100 days of HSCT. Co-pathogens were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: The newly described HRV-C was the most common rhinovirus group detected in HSCT recipients with respiratory infection, with co-pathogens being frequent.

Using the human decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), a known glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid-anchored protein, chimeric constructs were made to substitute the GPI-anchor domain of DAF with the putative lipid-anchor domain of GP4, and their membrane association and lipase cleavage were determined in cells. The DAF-GP4 fusion protein was transported to the plasma membrane and was cleaved by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), indicating that the C-terminal domain of GP4 functions as a GPI anchor. Mutational studies for residues adjacent to the GPI modification site and characterization of respective mutant viruses generated from infectious cDNA clones show that the ability of GP4 for membrane association corresponded to virus viability and growth characteristics. The residues T158 (\u03C9\u22122, where \u03C9 is the GPI moiety at E160), P159 (\u03C9\u22121), and M162 (\u03C9\u002B2) of GP4 were determined to be important for virus replication, with M162 being of particular importance for virus infectivity. The complete removal of the peptide\u2013anchor domain in GP4 resulted in a complete loss of virus infectivity. The depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cells reduced the virus production, suggesting a role of lipid rafts in PRRSV infection. Remarkably, GP4 was found to co-localize with CD163 in the lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. Since CD163 has been reported as a cellular receptor for PRRSV and GP4 has been shown to interact with this receptor, our data implicates an important role of lipid rafts during entry of the virus.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Yijun; Pattnaik, Asit K.; Song, Cheng; Yoo, Dongwan; Li, Gang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222209/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211005691; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211005691","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAF","GPI","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of GP4","putative lipid-anchor domain of GP4","lipid-anchored membrane protein","GPI anchor","membrane association","DAF-GP4 fusion protein","lipid-anchored protein","GPI-anchor domain of DAF","virus viability","virus production","virus replication","plasma membrane of cells","C-terminal domain of GP4 functions","important role of lipid rafts","GPI moiety","respiratory syndrome virus","complete loss of virus infectivity","GPI modification site","C-terminus","PRRSV infection","M162","CD163","phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C","residues adjacent","complete removal","residues T158","cellular receptor","known glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol","characterization of respective mutant viruses","infectious cDNA clones","CD55","PI-PLC","structure","E160","glycoprotein","peptide","entry","human decay-accelerating factor","particular importance","chimeric constructs","typical type","hydrophilic tail","P159","lipase cleavage","data","Mutational studies","growth characteristics","depletion of cholesterol"],"language":"en"},

The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with $R_0:8\\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5f95bd68657e637421c568d897ef1f8743b5e2b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03828v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","transmission potential","clusters of transmission models","recent outbreak","light of varying data quality","initial stage","statistical estimation","model fitting","robust estimation","fitting contagious disease","recent research works","large initial infected group","timeliness","dictates","basic reproductive number","robustness","novel coronavirus","key factors","substantial concern","China","measles","outliers","reported cases","perspective","Sample consensus algorithm","global health crisis","cities","sim14","paper","world"],"language":"en"},

Given that high opacity abnormalities (i.e., consolidations) were shown to correlate with severe disease, the paper introduces two combined severity measures (Percentage of Opacity, Percentage of High Opacity) and (Lung Severity Score, Lung High Opacity Score). They quantify the extent of overall COVID-19 abnormalities and the presence of high opacity abnormalities, global and lobe-wise, respectively, being computed based on 3D segmentations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Materials and Methods: The proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted Chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in 3D. It outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung/lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure (POO, POHO) is global, while the second (LSS, LHOS) is lobe-wise. Evaluation is reported on CTs of 100 subjects (50 COVID-19 confirmed and 50 controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and US. Ground truth is established by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Results: Pearson Correlation Coefficient between method prediction and ground truth is 0.97 (POO), 0.98 (POHO), 0.96 (LSS), 0.96 (LHOS). Automated processing time to compute the severity scores is 10 seconds/case vs 30 mins needed for manual annotations. Conclusion: A new method identifies regions of abnormalities seen in COVID-19 non-contrasted Chest CT and computes (POO, POHO) and (LSS, LHOS) severity scores.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaganti, Shikha; Balachandran, Abishek; Chabin, Guillaume; Cohen, Stuart; Flohr, Thomas; Georgescu, Bogdan; Grenier, Philippe; Grbic, Sasa; Liu, Siqi; Mellot, Franccois; Murray, Nicolas; Nicolaou, Savvas; Parker, William; Re, Thomas; Sanelli, Pina; Sauter, Alexander W.; Xu, Zhoubing; Yoo, Youngjin; Ziebandt, Valentin; Comaniciu, Dorin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b80887040d2e950d6da856b07a4245d1baa12dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01279v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ground Glass Opacities","High Opacity"],"locations":["Canada","Europe"],"keyphrases":["presence of high opacity abnormalities","severity of lung","Percentage of High Opacity","Lung High Opacity Score","Percentage of Opacity","severity scores","extent of COVID","Lung Severity Score","combined severity measures","regions of abnormalities","presence of high opacities","POO","lungs","POHO","LSS","LHOS","lobes","extent of overall COVID","method prediction","proposed method","new method","Ground truth","lobe-wise","manual annotations of lesions","non-contrasted Chest CT","deep learning","Ground Glass Opacities","combined measures","lobe involvement","consolidations","deep reinforcement learning","D segmentations of lesions","Pearson Correlation Coefficient","case vs","computes","mins","seconds","paper","abnormal tomographic patterns","institutions","Canada","Results","GGO","Automated processing time","Europe","Materials","Methods","Conclusion","controls","severe disease","subjects","Evaluation","Purpose"],"language":"en"},

For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or other pathogens. The study of pneumonia etiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the etiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. This paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population etiology distribution and the individual etiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study of 9; 500 children for 7 sites around the world. We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially-latent class model (pLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case-control study. We introduce the pLCM as an extension of the latent class model. We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent-class frequencies. The methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to PERCH data. The paper closes with a brief description of extensions of the pLCM to the regression setting and to the case where conditional independence among the measures is relaxed.","publish_time":"2014-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Zhenke; Deloria-Knoll, Maria; Hammitt, Laura L.; Zeger, Scott L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a5063a208813acc65014b86641082026c0906a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5774v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of pneumonia etiology","latent class model","etiology of disease","Pneumonia Etiology Research","population etiology distribution","latent class indicators","population data","latent-class frequencies","pLCM","PERCH data","individual etiology probabilities","population studies","case-control study","simulated data","heterogeneous measurements","statistical terms","clinical diagnosis of lung infection","statistical methodology","paper closes","standard clinical practice","mixing weights","Child Health","different error rates","estimation","etiologic pathogen","brief description of extensions","fraction of cases attributable","goal","multiple peripheral specimens","conditional independence","measures","scientific problem","settings","children","regression","example","graphical displays","sites","world","pathogens","causes","methods"],"language":"en"},

Uniquely in recent times, governments have imposed partly voluntary, partly compulsory restrictions on the population to slow the spread of the virus. In this context, public attitudes and behaviors are vitally important for reducing the death rate. Analyzing tweets about the disease may therefore give insights into public reactions that may help guide public information campaigns. This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about COVID-19 from March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction: gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global spread of the virus and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus. For example, failure to impose a sporting bans whilst encouraging social distancing may send mixed messages to males.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thelwall, Mike; Thelwall, Saheeda","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab609df01b35223d4c1ec4d6fe84cfe349ad608b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11090v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public reactions","virus","public attitudes","global public health","public information announcements","public information campaigns","global spread","relevant aspect of public reaction","social distancing","COVID","context of family","political reactions","population safe","English tweets","detailed results","healthcare","sporting bans","gender differences","urgent threat","responsibility","mixed messages","behaviors","sports cancellations","governments","failure","compulsory restrictions","article","disease","insights","disproportionate share","recent times","death rate","example","females","women","start"],"language":"en"},

We study the data in the framework of time series network data. The networks are defined by using the geodesic distances of the districts or cities specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates. We particularly restrict our analysis to all but districts in the north-eastern part of India. Unlike recent studies on the projection of the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the near future, in this note, the emphasis is on understanding the dynamics of the spread of the virus across the districts of India. We perform spectral and structural analysis of the model networks by considering several measures, notably the spectral radius, the algebraic connectivity, the average clustering coefficient, the average path length and the structure of the communities. Furthermore, we study the overall expansion properties given by the number of districts or cities before and after lockdown. These studies show that lockdown has a significant impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in districts or cities over long distances. However, this impact is only observed after approximately two weeks of lockdown. We speculate that this happened due to the insufficient number of tests for COVID-19 before the lockdown which could not stop the movement of people infected with the virus but not detected, over long distances.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pandey, Pradumn Kumar; Adhikari, Bibhas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11973v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["number of districts","districts of India","cities","number of people","time series data of number","long distances","weeks of lockdown","insufficient number of tests","SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","virus","geodesic distances","COVID","framework of time series network data","spectral radius","model networks","structural analysis","movement of people","significant impact","recent studies","average clustering coefficient","average path length","algebraic connectivity","structure","measures","projection","latitude","overall expansion properties","note","near future","dynamics","longitude coordinates","emphasis","communities"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the Covid-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of any authoritative scientific consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real-time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahsavari, Shadi; Holur, Pavan; Tangherlini, Timothy R.; Roychowdhury, Vwani","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13783v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bill Gates"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stories","pandemic","virus","underlying narrative frameworks","various narrative frameworks","narrative theory","conspiracy theories","social media sites","conspiracy theorists","Rumors","ones","spread","long term social","news reports","low trust","devising methods","global cabal","environments of low confidence","global surveillance regime","application of automated machine-learning methods","demonstrations","recent events","resistance","real-world behavior","little impact","public health orders","attacks","destruction of property","cover","economic ramifications","Asian Americans","authoritative scientific consensus","lack","containment","reinterpretation","generative basis","generation","dynamics of storytelling","Chinese","Bill Gates","disparate domains of knowledge","conclusions","G network","Covid","hoax","bio-weapon","areas","broader reporting","alignments","attachments"],"language":"en"},

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avila, Eduardo; Dorn, Marcio; Alho, Clarice Sampaio; Kahmann, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10227v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["qRT-PCR results","hemogram data","qRT-PCR test results","symptomatic essential workforce","hemogram exam data","symptomatic individuals","essential personnel","Hemogram result data","Machine learning models","Data assessment","COVID","inexpensive exam data","symptomatic patients","available local testing capacity","testing deficiency","testing insufficiency","Proposed models","resource scarcity scenarios","essential workforce management","Naive-Bayes model","model-based patient selection","background scarcity context","handling different scarcity scenarios","widespread reports of essential services breakdown","personnel shortage","resource distribution","diagnosis demand","critical element","critical circumstances","actual prediction context","high accuracy","lack of medical resources","current protocols","order","collapse of health care structure","emergency response systems","sensitivity","countries","duty","absence of diagnostic tests","strategic decision-making","simultaneous basis","pandemics","desired outcome","specificity","prior probabilities","fine-tuning","Methods","situations","random choice"],"language":"en"},

In order to remedy the drawback of differential privacy, we revisit the Dalenius\u0027 paper [1] that motivates differential privacy, and introduce a new privacy model to control individual\u0027s information disclosure. The rationality of the privacy model is based on the information theory, i.e., the mutual information of one individual\u0027s information and the statistical outputs is upper bounded by a small value. The new privacy model accurately captures the weakness of differential privacy when dealing with dependent informations. Furthermore, the new privacy model gets on well with differential privacy. When the informations of individuals are independent, we prove that a mechanism that satisfies $\\epsilon$-differential privacy would ensure to satisfy the new privacy model. When the informations of individuals are dependent, we prove that the group privacy method to achieve differential privacy in dependent case can be used to achieve the new privacy model. When the dependence extents of the informations of individuals are weak, we find differentially private mechanism which can satisfy the new privacy model with noise magnitude far less than the mechanism based on the group privacy based method.

Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system ($\\alpha=0$), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable when $R_0\\le 1$, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Zhenzhen; Yu, Yongguang; Chen, YangQuan; Ren, Guojian; Xu, Conghui; Wang, Shuhui; Yin, Zhe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4df7ec80a84385b30b85a0432b1a770fd4671d92.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12308v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["proposed system","proposed model","inter-city network system","fractional-order model","integer-order system","fraction-order model","fractional-order SEIHDR system","city closure","real-data","mathematical model","hospitalized individuals","inter-city networked coupling effects","types of individuals","infectivity of individuals","cities","paper","number of prediction days","basic reproduction number","dynamic behavior of COVID","significant case","peak number of confirmed people","better fitting","Beijing","predictor-correctors scheme","numerical solutions","bounded solution","China","Wuhan","mortality rates","results","absence","initial condition","lock","disease-free equilibrium point","squares method","Huanggang","virus","Shanghai","threshold","existence","uniqueness","incubation","quarantine measures","pandemic","theoretical basis","Italy","contrast","alpha","account","future","impact"],"language":"en"},

Our analysis exploits the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain lockdown measures came into force, based on measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific start of the epidemic and comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates. When estimating the effect of the relative timing of measures, we control for regional characteristics and initial epidemic trends by linear regression (Germany and Switzerland), doubly robust estimation (Germany), or synthetic controls (Switzerland). We find for both countries that a relatively later exposure to the measures entails higher cumulative hospitalization and death rates on region-specific days after the outbreak of the epidemic, suggesting that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one. For Germany, we also evaluate curfews (as introduced in a subset of states) based on cross-regional variation. We do not find any effects of curfews on top of the federally imposed contact restriction that banned groups of more than 2 individuals. Finally, an analysis of mobility patterns in Switzerland shows an immediate behavioral effect of the lockdown in terms of reduced mobility.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huber, Martin; Langen, Henrika","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3ccb0e61805cee4ddbb067d49948eeecaf07ea0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11278v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["Switzerland","Germany","response measures","certain lockdown measures","relative timing of measures","earlier imposition of measures","initial epidemic trends","death rates","cumulative COVID","region-specific start","regions","later exposure","higher cumulative hospitalization","analysis of mobility patterns","region-specific days","related hospitalization","regional characteristics","measuring health outcomes relative","impact of COVID","effects of curfews","immediate behavioral effect","terms of reduced mobility","cross-regional variation","linear regression","force","groups","outbreak","robust estimation","imposed contact restriction","synthetic controls","subset of states","fact","countries","individuals","dates"],"language":"en"},

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f30718ad585efebbea024f4033820ab8e2a4c490.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14133v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed Inf-Net","COVID-SemiSeg","novel COVID","tackling COVID","chest CT slices","semi-supervised segmentation framework","Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network","real CT volumes","semi-supervised framework","challenges","labeled images","infected regions","unlabeled data","shortage of labeled data","deep model","cutting-edge segmentation models","infection characteristics","Automated detection of lung infections","state-of-the-art performance","higher performance","explicit edge-attention","traditional healthcare strategy","implicit reverse attention","selected propagation strategy","low intensity contrast","computed tomography","great potential","learning ability","training","high variation","short time period","normal tissues","parallel partial decoder","high-level features","world","existential health crisis","global map","Extensive experiments","boundaries","Coronavirus Disease","representations"],"language":"en"},

The quantification of atmospheric aerosols and their relationship to climatic impacts are key to understanding the dynamics of climate forcing and to improve our knowledge about climate change. Due to its response to precipitation, temperature, topography and human activity, one of the most dynamical atmospheric regions is the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL): ABL aerosols have a sizable impact on the evolution of the radiative forcing of climate change, human health, food security, and, ultimately, on the local and global economy. The identification of ABL pattern behaviour requires constant monitoring and the application of instrumental and computational methods for its detection and analysis. Here, we show a new method for the retrieval of ABL top arising from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) signals, by training a convolutional neural network in a supervised manner; forcing it to learn how to retrieve such a dynamical parameter on real, non-ideal conditions and in a fully automated, unsupervised way. Our findings pave the way for a full integration of LiDAR elastic, inelastic, and depolarisation signal processing, and provide a novel approach for real-time quantitative sensing of aerosols.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vivas, David R.; S\u0027anchez, Estiven; Reina, John H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa1c79fbd60c7b7270b8bdaad66d86ee31993c83.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04353v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ABL aerosols","global climate","quantification of atmospheric aerosols","retrieval of ABL","radiative forcing of climate change","dynamics of climate","dynamical atmospheric regions","global economy","identification of ABL pattern behaviour","real-time quantitative sensing of aerosols","atmospheric boundary layer","question of global concern","human health","human activity","dynamical parameter","light detection","unsupervised way","integration of LiDAR elastic","constant monitoring","application of instrumental","novel approach","relationship","sustainable future of humankind stems","non-ideal conditions","depolarisation signal processing","temperature","topography","computational methods","climatic impacts","effect","evolution","convolutional neural network","food security","sizable impact","supervised manner","precipitation","signals","arising","response","analysis","new method","knowledge","findings"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19 pandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are helping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread, enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and conferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the pandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss the challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and misinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication technologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of industries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at risk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the pandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saeed, Nasir; Bader, Ahmed; Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y.; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06b161c7e91329727d8cbb521b59d590406a9cb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06637v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wireless technologies","digital technologies","importance of wireless communication technologies","availability of wireless communication technologies","post-pandemic era","global crisis","COVID","global health","global economy","role of wireless communications","importance of digital inclusiveness","automation of industries","healthcare automation","economic crisis","survival","supply chain","possible solutions","e-commerce","virtual education","virus","privacy","security","occupations","different perspectives","world","conferencing","misinformation","Countries","year","monitoring","way","challenges","risk","paper"],"language":"en"},

To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs.

It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blasius, Bernd","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf2a3a490911bda4071b903e31bad996a8f47263.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00940v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["large-scale spread","epidemic spread","early spread of epidemics","simple dual-scale model","network of interconnected countries","cases","theory","pandemic","dual-scale process","truncated power-law","small-scale growth rates","distribution of confirmed COVID","simple meta-population model","critical temporal","ratio of large-scale","critical exponent","exponential growth","spatial scales of response","future epidemic threats","small-scale accumulation of case numbers","numerical simulations","time course","deaths","emerging respiratory infectious disease","scaling behavior","macro-epidemiological patterns","distributions","coronavirus SARS-CoV","huge contrasts","mechanistic explanation","initial phase","origin","country","month","epicenters","Wuhan","China","orders of magnitude","counties","outbreak","globe"],"language":"en"},

It is the phenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates the movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new technique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically. Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose metric. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use the measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29 prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar starts playing even more central role in the FX market.

To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 Chest CT images.

Nicotine established a stable interaction with the conserved amino acid residues: Asp382, Gly405, His378 and Tyr385 through His401 of the soluble ACE2 that seals its interaction with the INS1. Also, nicotine binding has significantly reduced the affinity score of ACE2 with INS1 to -12.6 kcal/mol (versus -15.7 kcal/mol without nicotine) and the interface area to 1933.6 square Angstrom (versus 2057.3 square Angstrom without nicotine). Nicotine exhibited a higher binding affinity score with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex with -6.33 kcal/mol (Vs -5.24 kcal/mol without SARS-CoV-2) and a lowered inhibitory contant value of 22.95 micromolar (Vs 151.69 micromolar without SARS-CoV). Eventhough ACE2 is not a potential receptor for nicotine binding in the healthy people, in COVID19 patients, it may exhibit better binding affinity with the ACE2 receptor. In overall, nicotines strong preference for ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex might drastically reduce the SARS-CoV-2 virulence by intervening the ACE2 conserved residues interaction with the spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"SelvaaKumar, C; Kumar, Senthil Arun; Wei, Haiyan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c458e713520589bf1f7efc53113b34f372d325a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14943v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eventhough"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2-SARS","SARS-CoV","ACE2 receptor","soluble ACE2","effect of nicotine binding","protein of SARS","Eventhough ACE2","affinity score of ACE2","kcal","ACE2 conserved residues interaction","higher binding affinity score","mild adverse clinical symptoms of SARS","micromolar","Vs","stable interaction","square Angstrom","potential receptor","complex","INS1","conserved amino acid residues","soluble angiotensin","Gly405","Asp382","spike","Tyr385","healthy people","His378","His401","enzyme","lowered inhibitory contant value","virulence","interface area","nicotines strong preference","COVID19 patients","Smokers","silico study"],"language":"en"},

The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories.

In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, $66\\%$ of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals\u0027 characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change.

About 10% of all hospitalized patients with CAP require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the mortality of these patients reaches 20\u201350%. Objective To evaluate the clinical presentation, bacteriological profile and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP). Patients and methods 54 patients presented by symptoms and sign of severe community acquired pneumonia who were admitted to respiratory care unit of Alhussein, Al-Azhar University Hospital from August 2015 to March 2016 were subjected to full clinical examination, chest X ray, complete blood picture, sputum and blood culture, PCR for suspected cases of Influenza H1N1 and MERS-COV, treatment, follow up, data collections and statistical analysis. Results The present study included 54 patients 26 males and 28 females with SCAP who were admitted to respiratory care unit of Alhussein, Al-Azhar University Hospital. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The most common presentations were fever, cough, dyspnea and hypoxemia. Two patients developed renal failure and 4 patients developed septic shock. The most common isolated organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, Influenza H1N1, and Staphylococcus aureus. Mortality was 24% and it was common in patients with comorbidity than in patients without comorbidities. Conclusion SCAP occurs more frequently in those with comorbidities. The most frequent isolated causative organism of SCAP is S. pneumoniae, Influenza H1N1 and S. aureus. SCAP is associated with significant mortality, early recognition and prompt treatment may improve outcome.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elshamly, Mousa; Nour, Mohamed O.; Omar, Abdelmaaboud M.M.","journal":"Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de7704fb9138bf720717a411721ced4af22459a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125902.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S042276381630036X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2016.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288129/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S042276381630036X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus pneumoniae","S. pneumoniae","S. aureus"],"organizations":["CAP","Al-Azhar University Hospital","SCAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","Conclusion SCAP","common comorbidities","outcome of severe community","common isolated organism","frequent isolated causative organism of SCAP","respiratory care unit of Alhussein","common presentations","sign of severe community","intensive care unit","suspected cases of Influenza H1N1","Al-Azhar University Hospital","Abstract Background Severe community","significant mortality","blood culture","Streptococcus pneumoniae","prompt treatment","clinical examination","clinical presentation","Staphylococcus aureus","complete blood picture","chest X ray","sputum","PCR","bacteriological profile","admission","early recognition","fever","cough","MERS-COV","symptoms","renal failure","dyspnea","data collections","diabetes mellitus","hypertension","ICU","comorbidity","septic shock","statistical analysis","hypoxemia","present study","females","methods","life-threatening condition","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Two models of game theory are applied to identify nine proposed key factors that constitute the \u201Czero-tour\u201D phenomenon. These involve interactions in both the temporal and spatial dimensions of all of the stakeholders concerned with such tours, from outbound tourists and outbound and inbound operators to local guides and governments both within and beyond the Chinese border.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 251 children upon their admission to hospital because of fever and signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection in order to identify the virus and determine its nasopharyngeal load, and a venous blood sample was taken in order to evaluate viremia. Fifty children (19.9 %) had RV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs, six (12 %) of whom also had RV viremia: RV-C in four cases (66.6 %), and RV-A and RV-B in one case each. The RV nasopharyngeal load was significantly higher in the children with RV viremia (p \u003C 0.001), who also had a higher respiratory rate (p = 0.02), white blood cell counts (p = 0.008) and C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.006), lower blood O(2) saturation levels (P = 0.005), and more often required O(2) therapy (p = 0.009).

Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced. METHODS: We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages), bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence. RESULTS: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains.

In the present study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates. The entire S genes of all isolates were found to be nine nucleotides longer in length than other PEDV reference strains. This size difference was due to the combined presence of notable 15bp insertion and 6bp deletion within the N-terminal region of the S1 domain of the Korean isolates. In addition, the largest number of amino acid variations was accumulated in the S1 N-terminal region, leading to the presence of hypervariability in the isolates. Sequence comparisons at the peptide level of the S proteins revealed that all seven Korean isolates shared diverse similarities ranging from a 93.6% to 99.6% identity with each other but exhibited a 92.2% to 93.7% identity with other reference strains. Collectively, the sequence analysis data indicate the diversity of the PEDV isolates currently prevalent in Korea that represents a heterogeneous group. Phylogenetic analyses showed two separate clusters, in which all Korean field isolates were grouped together in the second cluster (group 2). The results indicate that prevailing isolates in Korea are phylogenetically more closely related to each other rather than other reference strains. Interestingly, the tree topology based on the nucleotide sequences representing the S1 domain or the S1 N-terminal region most nearly resembled the full S gene-based phylogenetic tree. Therefore, our data implicates a potential usefulness of the partial S protein gene including the N-terminal region in unveiling genetic relatedness of PEDV isolates.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Dong-Kyu; Park, Choi-Kyu; Kim, Seong-Hee; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daa7cfa2ea8efff041b0ad3f9f488beca8cc78fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114470.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210000419; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.01.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20132850/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210000419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["Korean isolates","Korean PEDV isolates","prevailing isolates","Korean field isolates","S1 N-terminal region","genetic relatedness of PEDV isolates","PEDV reference strains","S1 domain","S proteins","entire S genes","partial S protein gene","phylogenetic tree","identity","complete nucleotide sequences","sequence analysis data","bp insertion","bp deletion","glycoprotein genes","presence of hypervariability","Sequence comparisons","Phylogenetic analyses","tree topology","heterogeneous group","combined presence of notable","significant economic impacts","spike","diversity","domestic swine industry","potential usefulness","largest number of amino acid variations","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","peptide level","pig production","separate clusters","length","addition","results","diverse similarities","nucleotides","present study","size difference"],"language":"en"},

Overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 29%. History of ischemic cardiac disease, fever, older age (over age 70) and dyspnea at presentation were associated with the risk of developing ARDS whereas fever, cough and a C-reactive protein higher than 50 mg/l at disease presentation were associated with the risk of death.

C. burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in cattle, sheep and goats, and cases of abortion have been observed in dogs and cats. Moreover, several outbreaks of C. burnetii infection in humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens, and some of these animals experienced abortion. Leptospira interrogans sensu lato is able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens. The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the identification of possible infectious agents. One hundred and fifty-one specimens were tested using PCR assays and found negative for C. burnetii and Leptospira DNA. However, in 49 samples (47.6%) other infectious causes of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were identified. These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths in dogs. However, given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of these agents, surveillance of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation of these events.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stefanetti, Valentina; Compagnone, Agnese; Sordini, Chiara; Passamonti, Fabrizio; Rampacci, Elisa; Moscati, Livia; Marenzoni, Maria Luisa","journal":"Topics in Companion Animal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f78b051ab35efcfb25e72166844b19f8c886bc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104966.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193897361830059X; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2018.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502862/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193897361830059X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of abortion","feline abortion","neonatal mortality","stillbirth","Abstract Abortion","infectious causes of abortion","Leptospira DNA","cases of canine","Coxiella burnetii","burnetii infection","zoonotic agents","neonatal deaths","animals experienced abortion","queens","common abortigenic agents","abortigenic role","surveillance of canine","zoonotic role","identification of possible infectious agents","Leptospira interrogans sensu lato","events","feline pregnancies","Unusual abortigenic","breeding bitches","dogs","known cause","reproductive disorders","cattle","sheep","goats","retrospective series","animal species","humans","PCR assays","systematic investigation","potential abortigentic","outbreaks of","specimens","study","results","aim","cats","samples"],"language":"en"},

Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50\u201360 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70\u201380 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents.","publish_time":"1976-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doughri, A.

OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during \u2018colds\u2019, viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship. Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation. Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence. Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced inflammation.","publish_time":"2014-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; DeDiego, Marta L.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c36bbbb2505c7eefacad040c39bd5b167969ad2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4133396.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122212/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004320","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM","MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV E protein PBM","protein-protein interactions","SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV virulence","Cellular protein syntenin","SARS-CoVs","Elimination of SARS","SARS-CoV infected cells","E protein PDZ-binding motif","p38 MAPK activation","p38 MAPK inhibitor","Active p38 MAPK","parental virus","virus attenuation","mediator of p38 MAPK induced inflammation","virulence domain","Silencing of syntenin","major determinant of virulence","overexpression of inflammatory cytokines","lungs of mice","mice survival","decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines","hybrid","recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation","increase","reverse genetics","viruses","yeast","complementary strategies","confocal microscopy assays","deleterious exacerbation","immune response","reduction","cell cytoplasm","nucleus","siRNAs","immunopathology","pathway","relevance","envelope","administration","functional relationship"],"language":"en"},

To address the critical need for evidence regarding the global burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs, we assessed the burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs through a systematic review of the published literature. METHODS: We identified articles published between April 1964 and March 2019 through searches of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Experimental and observational studies published in English that included adults aged \u226560 residing in LTCFs who were unvaccinated (to identify the natural infection burden), and that reported measures of occurrence for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or pneumonia were included. Disagreements about article inclusion were discussed and articles were included based on consensus. Data on study design, population, and findings were extracted from each article. Findings were synthesized qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 1451 articles were screened for eligibility, 345 were selected for full-text review, and 26 were included. Study population mean ages ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years. Three (12%) studies reported influenza estimates, 7 (27%) RSV, and 16 (62%) pneumonia. Eighteen (69%) studies reported incidence estimates, 7 (27%) prevalence estimates, and 1 (4%) both. Seven (27%) studies reported outbreaks. Respiratory infection incidence estimates ranged from 1.1 to 85.2% and prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4 to 55.8%. Influenza incidences ranged from 5.9 to 85.2%. RSV incidence proportions ranged from 1.1 to 13.5%. Pneumonia prevalence proportions ranged from 1.4 to 55.8% while incidence proportions ranged from 4.8 to 41.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The reported incidence and prevalence estimates of respiratory infections among older LTCF residents varied widely between published studies. The wide range of estimates offers little useful guidance for decision-making to decrease respiratory infection burden. Large, well-designed epidemiologic studies are therefore still necessary to credibly quantify the burden of respiratory infections among older adults in LTCFs, which will ultimately help inform future surveillance and intervention efforts.

Few cases of severe pulmonary disease following primary infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were reported. Objectives To investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of parvovirus B19 in the lower respiratory tract. Study design The prevalence of parvovirus B19-DNA was evaluated by Real-Time PCR in 264 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from 189 adult patients over a full-year period and related to demographic characteristics, underlying pathologies, immune status, admission to intensive care unit, mortality within 28 days, and discharge diagnosis. Results Parvovirus B19-DNA was detected in 7/189 (3.7%) patients, without significant association to demographic characteristics, immune status, transplant versus non-transplant status, admission to intensive care unit, presence of haematological conditions. In two lung transplant recipients surveillance specimens were positive to B19. Four of the remaining five patients presented respiratory insufficiency. A significant association to mortality was found, as 3/7 (42.9%) positive patients died within 28 days. No patient presented serological evidence of recent or acute infection and viremia. Conclusions Parvovirus B19 may be detected at low frequency in BAL specimens from patients with different pathological backgrounds. This finding could be due to chronic infection with virus persistence in the lower respiratory tract, also in the absence of symptoms unequivocally attributable to B19. The high rate of mortality warrants the need for further studies to evaluate the opportunity to consider parvovirus B19 in the diagnostic work-up of lower respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa, Cristina; Terlizzi, Maria Elena; Solidoro, Paolo; Libertucci, Daniela; Bergallo, Massimiliano; Cavallo, Rossana","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6930ebb3a5c134feec4e430de34f2977ef5a2040.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172881.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.06.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632147/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusions Parvovirus B19","prevalence of parvovirus B19-DNA","Results Parvovirus B19-DNA","clinical impact of parvovirus B19","positive patients","Abstract Background Human parvovirus B19 infection","adult patients","immunocompromised patients","primary infection","acute infection","chronic infection","persistent infection","lower respiratory tract infections","immune status","respiratory insufficiency","non-transplant status","admission","intensive care unit","demographic characteristics","BAL specimens","significant association","days","high rate of mortality","lung transplant recipients surveillance specimens","cases of severe pulmonary disease","underlying pathologies","virus persistence","serological evidence of recent","self-limiting course","low frequency","diagnostic work","Real-Time PCR","presence of haematological conditions","different pathological backgrounds","bronchoalveolar lavages","year period","need","absence of symptoms","viral clearance","studies","viremia","opportunity","Study","discharge diagnosis","Objectives","finding"],"language":"en"},

Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable \u201Creal-time\u201D monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaari, Lotfi; Golubnitschaja, Olga","journal":"EPMA J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/169dfee7f1e122f4a0ad22d736964ca90b28f76d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182506.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00207-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tunisia","China","Europe","Sfax"],"keyphrases":["pandemic scenario","pandemic wave","current pandemic situation","infection distribution","country regions","protective measures","preventive measures","infection evolution","epidemic scenario","large number of undetected Covid","post-containment pandemic rebound","world","Tunisia","countries","low numbers of Covid","exponential phase","lessons","optimal predictive strategy","context of advanced predictive","sub-populations","under-protection","lack of tests","minor number of new cases","potential protective strategies","randomised laboratory tests","unnecessary over-protection","mortality rate analysis","long-term economic recession","quantitative comparative analysis","main economic partner","incorrect political decisions","conclusion","Europe","monitoring","effective evidence","heterogeneous picture","significant delay","vaccination issues","prediction","infected individuals","medical approach","research teams","societies","China","model","contrast","disease","Sfax","Recommendations","paper"],"language":"en"},

To find a valid plan for these services, an optimization problem called the home healthcare routing and scheduling problem is motivated to perform the logistics of the home care services. Although most studies mainly focus on minimizing the total cost of logistics activities, no study, as far as we know, has treated the patients\u2019 satisfaction as an objective function under uncertainty. To make this problem more practical, this study proposes a bi-objective optimization methodology to model a multi-period and multi-depot home healthcare routing and scheduling problem in a fuzzy environment. With regards to a group of uncertain parameters such as the time of travel and services as well as patients\u2019 satisfaction, a fuzzy approach named as the Jimenez\u2019s method, is also utilized. To address the proposed home healthcare problem, new and well-established metaheuristics are obtained. Although the social engineering optimizer (SEO) has been applied to several optimization problems, it has not yet been applied in the healthcare routing and scheduling area. Another innovation is to develop a new modified multi-objective version of SEO by using an adaptive memory strategy, so-called AMSEO. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided by comparing the algorithms based on multi-objective metrics and sensitivity analyses. The practicality and efficiency of the AMSEO in this context lends weight to the development and application of the approach more broadly.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fathollahi-Fard, Amir Mohammad; Ahmadi, Abbas; Goodarzian, Fariba; Cheikhrouhou, Naoufel","journal":"Appl Soft Comput","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6516c8a685b4513b68dc25098d84fe1bcaf7d32d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c2287c2f3786a12df8d9bd719e8bcd54e98f274b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395097/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106385; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494620303252; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620303252?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jimenez"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed home healthcare problem","scheduling problem","multi-depot home healthcare routing","Home care services","healthcare costs","healthcare practitioners","multi-objective metrics","multi-period","objective function","new modified multi-objective version of SEO","bi-objective optimization methodology","scheduling area","fuzzy approach","study","patients\u2019 satisfaction","optimization problems","so-called AMSEO","fuzzy environment","total cost of logistics activities","adaptive memory strategy","hospitalization","alternative answer","well-established metaheuristics","group of uncertain parameters","context","weight","development","time of travel","important role","algorithms","sensitivity analyses","governments","regards","efficiency","application","social engineering optimizer","Jimenez\u2019s method","uncertainty","valid plan","practicality","innovation","comprehensive discussion","studies"],"language":"en"},

Over its 41-year existence, 21 persons exposed to highly hazardous infectious diseases were admitted to the Slammer, but none ever contracted the disease to which they had been exposed.

This concern notwithstanding, Emory University and the University of Nebraska opened HLCC units in civilian academic medical centers in 2004 and 2005, respectively. These units, distinct from conventional infectious disease isolation wards found in most major medical centers, proved their worth during the West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014\u20132015.

Although cholesterol is known to affect the replication of a broad range of viruses in vitro, its significance and role in porcine nidovirus infection remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether cellular or/and viral cholesterol levels play a role in porcine nidovirus infection. Our results showed that depletion of cellular cholesterol by treating cells with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) dose-dependently suppressed the replication of both nidoviruses. Conversely, cholesterol depletion from the viral envelope had no inhibitory effect on porcine nidovirus production. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to M\u03B2CD-treated cells moderately restored the infectivity of porcine nidoviruses, indicating that the presence of cholesterol in the target cell membrane is critical for viral replication. The antiviral activity of M\u03B2CD on porcine nidovirus infection was found to be predominantly exerted when used as a treatment pre-infection or prior to the viral entry process. Furthermore, pharmacological sequestration of cellular cholesterol efficiently blocked both virus attachment and internalization and, accordingly, markedly affected subsequent post-entry steps of the replication cycle, including viral RNA and protein biosynthesis and progeny virus production. Taken together, our data indicate that cell membrane cholesterol is required for porcine nidovirus entry into cells, and pharmacological drugs that hamper cholesterol-dependent virus entry may have antiviral potential against porcine nidoviruses.","publish_time":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeon, Ji Hyun; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43388d14facad76667109348d5f287d7fb7c5dbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884395/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3545-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine nidovirus entry","porcine nidovirus infection","porcine nidovirus production","cholesterol depletion","viral cholesterol levels","viral replication","presence of cholesterol","infectivity of porcine nidoviruses","cholesterol-dependent virus entry","depletion of cellular cholesterol","cell membrane cholesterol","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pharmacological sequestration of cellular cholesterol","viral entry process","addition of exogenous cholesterol","viral RNA","viral envelope","virus attachment","progeny virus production","viral pathogens of pigs","replication cycle","respiratory syndrome virus","M\u03B2CD-treated cells","role","antiviral activity of M\u03B2CD","treatment pre-infection","subsequent post-entry steps","target cell membrane","antiviral potential","pharmacological drugs","PRRSV","protein biosynthesis","significant economic threat","significance","inhibitory effect","PEDV","methyl-\u03B2","cyclodextrin","global pork industry","broad range of viruses","dose","data","results","internalization","present study"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Despite the frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorder must be understood as an autonomous pathology due to its own determinants, semiology and possibilities of evolution, either spontaneous or under treatment. The ease of access to multiple synthetic products via the Internet combined with the creativity of chemists are contributing to the emergence of novel practices ranging from chemsex to purple drank. Addictive behaviours result from a combination of individual factors (biological and psychological vulnerability) and contextual factors (availability and triviality of the toxicant in the environment). Other mental disorders are factors of vulnerability to addictive pathology as well as the addictive behaviours can reveal an emotional or psychotic pathology. The physician needs to hear the patient powerlessness hidden behind the craving and propose a therapy that may be chemical (including substitution treatment) and psychological. Most of the time, social support is necessary to correct the desocializing effects of substance use disorder or addictive behaviours.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucet, C.; Oli\u00E9, J.

Methods: We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and differential screening analysis to profile the mRNA expression patterns of children with CD and age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results: Sequence analysis of 1000 clones enriched by SSH identified 75 functionally annotated human genes, represented by 430 clones. The 75 genes have potential involvement in gene networks, such as antigen presentation, inflammation, infection mechanism, connective tissue development, cell cycle and cancer. Twenty\u2010eight genes were previously described in association with CD, while 47 were new genes not previously reported in the context of IBD. Additionally, 29 of the 75 genes have been previously implicated in bacterial and viral infections. Quantitative real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on ileal\u2010derived RNA from 13 CD and nine non\u2010IBD patients confirmed the upregulation of extracellular matrix gene MMP2 (P = 0.001), and cell proliferation gene REG1A (P = 0.063) in our pediatric CD cohort. Conclusion: The retrieval of 28 genes previously reported in association with adult CD emphasizes the importance of these genes in the pediatric setting. The observed upregulation of REG1A and MMP2, and their known impact on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, agrees with the clinical behavior of the disease. Moreover, the expressions of bacterial\u2010 and virus\u2010related genes in our CD\u2010patient tissues support the concept that microbial agents are important in the etiopathogenesis of CD.","publish_time":"2012-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sim, Winnie H; Wagner, Josef; Cameron, Donald J; Catto\u2010Smith, Anthony G; Bishop, Ruth F; Kirkwood, Carl D","journal":"J Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09461361d3f3f756b5c49eb5f1ec3de748ca0a0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167032.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098497/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2011.06973.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSH","IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus\u2010related genes","new genes","etiopathogenesis of CD","adult CD","pediatric CD cohort","annotated human genes","Expression profiling of genes specific","disease cause","pediatric Crohn\u0027s Disease","disease onset","cell proliferation gene REG1A","inflammatory bowel disease","upregulation of extracellular matrix gene MMP2","cell cycle","SSH","gene networks","non\u2010IBD patients","pediatric setting","clones","context of IBD","association","extracellular matrix remodeling","observed upregulation of REG1A","Sequence analysis","expressions of bacterial","differential screening analysis","mRNA expression patterns of children","infection mechanism","connective tissue development","Quantitative real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","matched controls","inflammation","antigen presentation","concept","sex","patient tissues","known impact","microbial agents","suppressive subtractive hybridization","derived RNA","Aim","importance","molecular mechanisms","cancer","potential involvement","clinical behavior","Methods","Background","Results","viral infections","Conclusion","retrieval"],"language":"en"},

Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. A total of 1141 ACO patients aged \u226565 years during 2005\u20132011 were observed and followed for 2 years. The Bice and Boxerman COC index (COCI) was used to evaluate COC by considering ambulatory care visits duo to COPD or asthma in the first year; ED visits and hospitalization for COPD or asthma were identified in the subsequent year, respectively. The COCI was divided into three levels (COCI \u003C 0.3= low, 0.3 \u2264 COCI\u003C1=medium, COCI = 1=high). The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ED visits and hospital admissions due to COPD or asthma. Results The average COCI was 0.55. 21.3% patients received outpatient care from a single physician. Compared to patients with high COC, those with low and medium COC had a higher risk of ED visits (aHR = 2.80 and 2.69, P \u003C .01) and admissions (aHR = 1.80 and 1.72, P \u003C .05). Conclusion Increasing COC is beneficial for elderly patients with ACO in disease management. Policymakers could create effective pay-for-performance programs for the elderly ACO population to enhance COC and improve care outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, Yu-Hsiang; Tseng, Tung-Sung; Ng, Yee-Yung; Wu, Shiao-Chi","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02612805eaebdc70fd7dc11ff6e091c0ca9dfdac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114593.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466799/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851018306432; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851018306432","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED","Cox"],"organizations":["COC","COPD","COCI","ACO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medium COC","high COC","ACO patients","asthma-COPD overlap","elderly patients","average COCI","Boxerman COC index","higher risk of ED visits","ambulatory care visits duo","elderly ACO population","continuity of care","outpatient care","care outcomes","elderly adults","hospitalization","aHR","years","disease management","hospital admissions","subsequent year","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","performance programs","Taiwan National Health Insurance research database","emergency department","associations","retrospective cohort study","effective pay","hazard ratio","Bice","single physician","Methods","Abstract Objective","Conclusion","levels","Policymakers","total","Cox model"],"language":"en"},

Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required. The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. KEY FINDINGS: Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, S.; Gardiner, E.","journal":"Radiography (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea210d6645ebbd59703dce661d49a466abc3b322.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164867.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817420300572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327383/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817420300572","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHS","ITU","POC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["lung condition","use of lung ultrasound","adoption of lung ultrasound","recent COVID","diagnosis of COVID","detection of multiple lung pathologies","outbreak","relation","diagnostic tool","chest radiographs","infected wards","current literature","Current events","point of care","NHS workforce","POC setting","pathognomonic findings","KEY FINDINGS","intensive care units","digestible reference guide","ionising radiation","rapid assessment","steep learning curves","ITUs","serial exposure","need","Computed Tomography","number of radiographers","turn","changes","Sonographers","low specificity","potential","PRACTICE","gold standard","time","resolution","bays","article","virus","OBJECTIVES","patients","China","Italy","CONCLUSION","IMPLICATIONS","practitioners","date","conjunction","aim"],"language":"en"},

Their replicative enzymes are translated from their genomic RNA, while their seven structural proteins are encoded by a set of small, partially overlapping genes in the genomic 3\u2032-proximal region. The latter are expressed via synthesis of a set of subgenomic mRNAs that, in general, are functionally monocistronic (except for a bicistronic mRNA encoding the E and GP2 proteins). ORF5, which encodes the major glycoprotein GP5, has been used extensively for phylogenetic analyses. However, an in-depth computational analysis now reveals the arterivirus-wide conservation of an additional AUG-initiated ORF, here termed ORF5a, that overlaps the 5\u2032 end of ORF5. The pattern of substitutions across sequence alignments indicated that ORF5a is subject to functional constraints at the amino acid level, while an analysis of substitutions at synonymous sites in ORF5 revealed a greatly reduced frequency of substitution in the portion of ORF5 that is overlapped by ORF5a. The 43\u201364 aa ORF5a protein and GP5 are probably expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA, via a translation initiation mechanism involving leaky ribosomal scanning. Inactivation of ORF5a expression by reverse genetics yielded a severely crippled EAV mutant, which displayed lower titres and a tiny plaque phenotype. These defects, which could be partially complemented in ORF5a-expressing cells, indicate that the novel protein, which may be the eighth structural protein of arteriviruses, is expressed and important for arterivirus infection.","publish_time":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firth, Andrew E.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Wills, Norma M.; Go, Yun Young; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

Even though multiple vaccines and treatments are under development so far, the disease is only slowing down under extreme social distancing measures that are difficult to maintain. SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store. The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis. Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.

The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.","publish_time":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sadasiv, Eileen C.; Yeh, Tamson T.; Chang, Pei W.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb21d026092146fa953db2a33f6730a4648d11e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016609349190012O; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016609349190012O","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pI of proteins","viral structural proteins","renatured viral proteins","Abstract Viral proteins","basis of variant proteins","alteration of pI","IBV strain Mass","IBV strain Ark","strain-specific variant bands","strain-specific antiserum","persistent strains","protein bands","altered pathogenicity of strains","antigen-antibody complexing","strains of infectious bronchitis virus","viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus","smaller viruses","isoelectric points","protein of greatest serological importance","peplomer tip","tissue affinities","different tissue trophism","function","comparison","serology","difference","SDS-PAGE separations","cross reaction of antisera","Classification"],"language":"en"},

The latter function involves reversing the post-translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with either ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes, but surprisingly, ISG15 is highly divergent among animals. The ramifications of this sequence divergence to the recognition of ISG15 by coronavirus PLPs at a structural and biochemical level are poorly understood. Therefore, the activity of PLPs from SARS-CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus was evaluated against seven ISG15s originating from an assortment of animal species susceptible, and not, to certain coronavirus infections. Excitingly, our kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analysis revealed an array of different preferences among PLPs. Included in these studies is the first insight into a coronavirus PLP\u2019s interface with ISG15 via SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with the principle binding domain of human ISG15 (hISG15) and mouse ISG15s (mISG15s). The first X-ray structure of the full-length mISG15 protein is also reported and highlights a unique, twisted hinge region of ISG15 that is not conserved in hISG15, suggesting a potential role in differential recognition. Taken together, this new information provides a structural and biochemical understanding of the distinct specificities among coronavirus PLPs observed and addresses a critical gap of how PLPs can interact with ISG15s from a wide variety of species.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Dzimianski, John V.; Clasman, Jozlyn R.; Goodwin, Octavia; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Pegan, Scott D.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66a57c2ab4f33de22787725089cb508573481a4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5634334.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438633/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283617301870; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283617301870","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus PLPs","recognition of ISG15","MERS-CoV","activity of PLPs","SARS-CoV PLpro","coronavirus PLP\u2019s interface","certain coronavirus infections","mouse ISG15s","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","twisted hinge region of ISG15","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","principle binding domain of human ISG15","structural analysis","hISG15","biochemical understanding","biochemical level","differential recognition","mouse hepatitis virus","wide variety of species","assortment of animal species susceptible","complex","distinct specificities","post-translational modification of cellular proteins","multifunctional papain","interferon-stimulated gene product","array of different preferences","RNA replication","host","X-ray structure","full-length mISG15 protein","viral polyprotein","potential role","insight","ubiquitin","sequence divergence","new information","critical gap","ability","proteases","mISG15s","immune response","ramifications","animals","eukaryotes","studies"],"language":"en"},

Whole genome sequence analysis of various isolates might provide an indication of potential strain differences of this new virus. Moreover, mutation analysis will help to develop effective vaccines. Methods We sequenced the entire SARS viral genome of cultured isolates from the index case (SIN2500) presenting in Singapore, from three primary contacts (SIN2774, SIN2748, and SIN2677), and one secondary contact (SIN2679). These sequences were compared with the isolates from Canada (TOR2), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1 and HKU39849), Hanoi (URBANI), Guangzhou (GZ01), and Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04). Findings We identified 129 sequence variations among the 14 isolates, with 16 recurrent variant sequences. Common variant sequences at four loci define two distinct genotypes of the SARS virus. One genotype was linked with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong, the second contained isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing with no association with Hotel M (p\u003C0.0001). Moreover, other common sequence variants further distinguished the geographical origins of the isolates, especially between Singapore and Beijing. Interpretation Despite the recent onset of the SARS epidemic, genetic signatures are emerging that partition the worldwide SARS viral isolates into groups on the basis of contact source history and geography. These signatures can be used to trace sources of infection. In addition, a common variant associated with a non-conservative aminoacid change in the S1 region of the spike protein, suggests that immunological pressures might be starting to influence the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations.

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented.

To investigate the current status of health care waste management at different levels of health care facilities (HCF) after the implementation of these regulations, one tertiary hospital, one secondary hospital, and four primary health care centers from Binzhou District were visited and 145 medical staff members and 24 cleaning personnel were interviewed. Generated medical waste totaled 1.22, 0.77, and 1.17kg/bed/day in tertiary, secondary, and primary HCF, respectively. The amount of medical waste generated in primary health care centers was much higher than that in secondary hospitals, which may be attributed to general waste being mixed with medical waste. This study found that the level of the HCF, responsibility for medical waste management in departments and wards, educational background and training experience can be factors that determine medical staff members\u2019 knowledge of health care waste management policy.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy.

The neck domain of these proteins drives multimerization, which is believed to be required for efficient recognition of multivalent ligands. The neck domain of DC-SIGN consists of seven sequence repeats with rare variations. In contrast, the DC-SIGNR neck domain is polymorphic and, in addition to the wild type (wt) allele with seven repeat units, allelic forms with five and six sequence repeats are frequently found. A potential association of the DC-SIGNR genotype and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. Therefore, we investigated if DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units exhibit defects in pathogen capture. Here, we show that wt DC-SIGNR and patient derived alleles with five and six repeats bind viral glycoproteins, augment viral infection and tetramerize with comparable efficiency. Moreover, coexpression of wt DC-SIGNR and alleles with five repeats did not decrease the interaction with pathogens compared to expression of each allele alone, suggesting that potential formation of hetero-oligomers does not appreciably reduce pathogen binding, at least under conditions of high expression. Thus, our results do not provide evidence for diminished pathogen capture by DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units. Albeit, we cannot exclude that subtle, but in vivo relevant differences remained undetected, our analysis suggests that indirect mechanisms could account for the association of polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck region with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2006-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gramberg, Thomas; Zhu, Tuofu; Chaipan, Chawaree; Marzi, Andrea; Liu, Huanliang; Wegele, Anja; Andrus, Thomas; Hofmann, Heike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377676b63e2a2c4571a0a7e56efec38cd733f04d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111803.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205007841; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007841","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC-SIGNR alleles","DC-SIGNR genotype","DC-SIGNR neck domain","DC-SIGNR augment infection","DC-SIGNR neck region","neck domain of DC","coexpression of wt DC-SIGNR","lectins DC-SIGN","viral infection","repeat units","sequence repeats","reduced risk of HIV","patient derived alleles","diminished pathogen capture","pathogen binding","potential association","pathogens","viral glycoproteins","association of polymorphisms","potential formation of hetero","conditions of high expression","human immunodeficiency virus","analysis","oligomers","Ebolavirus","addition","evidence","allelic forms","relevant differences","wild type","defects","indirect mechanisms","efficient recognition of multivalent ligands","EBOV","rare variations","comparable efficiency","multimerization","interaction","contrast","results","debate"],"language":"en"},

Here, a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex real-time SYBR Green RT-PCR assay were developed for accurately differentiating PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens targeting the N gene of TGEV, PEDV, and PDCoV, and the VP7 gene of PoRV. Results showed that the DPO primer allowed a wider annealing temperature range (40\u201365 \u00B0C) and had a higher priming specificity compared to conventional primer, in which more than 3 nucleotides in the 3\u2032- or 5\u2032-segment of DPO primer mismatched with DNA template, PCR amplification efficiency would decrease substantially or extension would not proceed.

The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Hengbo; Wei, Li; Niu, Ping","journal":"Glob Health Res Policy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7050114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00135-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","case detection","detection kit development","major public health","insufficient hospital services","contact tracing","quarantine","information","medical supplies","effective drugs","logistics","Challenges","cities","guidance","international multi-sectoral bodies","provincial governments","deaths","governance concerns","numbers of new infections","continuous efforts","nCoV","central government","travels","series of mandatory actions","solidarity","novel coronavirus","COVID","epidemic","China","world"],"language":"en"}]}

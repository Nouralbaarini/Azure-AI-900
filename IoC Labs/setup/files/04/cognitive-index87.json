Methods: Three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus\u2010negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice, at 21\u2010day intervals, with the vaccine and kept under observation. Two seronegative and virus\u2010negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls. For safety tests, two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed. Faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations. Both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain. Blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge. Results: Virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and PCR. Significantly, the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed. The two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis, and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge (dog 1) and two days postchallenge (dog 2), and by PCR for 23 median days. Clinical Significance: This study showed the efficacy of a high\u2010cell\u2010passage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity.","publish_time":"2007-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratelli, A.","journal":"J Small Anim Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f7c0df011e53936b93f38aabee187cf6f202a99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinated dogs","negative dogs","infection of dogs","additional dogs","virus shedding","virulent virus","unvaccinated control dogs","virus isolation assays","passage canine coronavirus vaccine","field canine coronavirus strain","days postchallenge","Faecal samples","cell cultures","vaccinations","PCR","ability","median days","Blood samples","serological tests","weekly intervals","clinical signs","safety tests","unvaccinated controls","Clinical Significance","day intervals","moderate enteritis","study","efficacy","times","vaccinal dose","reactions","weeks","sterilising immunity","Objectives","observation","Results","Methods","inoculations"],"language":"en"},

However, there have been few reports on suitable gene delivery systems for administration. In this study, we use a cationic emulsion system, which is physically stable and facilitates the transfer of genes in the presence of up to 90% serum, as a mucosal gene carrier. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cationic lipid emulsion was formulated with squalene and 1,2\u2010dioleoyl\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010trimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP) as major components. Emulsions formed stable complexes with DNA and protected and transferred DNA to target cells against DNase I digestion in the presence of mucosal destabilizers such as heparin sulfate (a polysaccharide of the glycosaminoglycan family in mucosa) and Newfectan (a natural lung extract of bovine) in an in vitro system. In contrast, commercial liposomes and counter liposomes, made with an identical lipid composition of emulsions, failed. After in vivo intranasal instillation, the cationic emulsion showed at least 200 times better transfection activity than the liposomal carriers in both nasal tissue and lung. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that cationic emulsions can mediate gene transfection into airway epithelium, making it a good choice for transferring therapeutic genes and for genetic vaccination against an pathogenic infection via an airway route.

We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital\u2010based population. Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n = 48) of all specimens. The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens. After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n = 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n = 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus\u20106 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n = 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C. This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies.

The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of hMPV infections in hospitalized infants \u003C2 years of age and to compare them to those of infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A prospective study was conducted on the clinical characteristics of infants admitted to hospital for respiratory infection through 5 years. Simultaneous detection of influenza A, B, and C viruses, RSV, and adenoviruses was performed in clinical samples by multiple reverse transcription nested\u2010PCR assay. The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples using two separate RT\u2010PCR tests. Some respiratory virus was detected in 70.5% of the 1,322 children included in the study. hMPV was found in 101 of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (10.8%), and was the most common virus after RSV and rhinovirus. Peak incidence was found in March. Over 80% of children were \u003C12 months. The more common diagnoses were bronchiolitis (49.5%) and recurrent wheezing (45.5%). Fifty\u2010four percent of cases required oxygen therapy and, one percent, assisted ventilation. Thirty percent were co\u2010infections, with clinical characteristics indistinguishable from single infections. Seventy\u2010one hMPV single infections were compared to 88 RSV single infections. hMPV infections were significantly more frequent than RSV in infants older than 6 months (P = 0.04). Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed more frequently in hMPV patients (P = 0.001). All other variables tested were similar, in both groups. hMPV was the third most frequent virus after RSV and rhinovirus in infants \u003C2 years of age, hospitalized for respiratory infection, and was associated with bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing. hMPV predominantly occurred in spring.

Here, we explored epidemiologic profile of causative pathogens and possible factors for exacerbation in a single center over a three\u2010year period. METHODS: Hospitalized asthmatic children with attack aged 6 months\u201017 years were recruited between 2012 and 2015 (n = 216). Nasopharyngeal mucosa cell samples were collected from the participants and examined by reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction to detect rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus (EV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and others. Clinical features, laboratory data, asthma exacerbation intensity, and asthma severity were compared among participants. Epidemiologic profile of causative pathogens and possible factors for exacerbation were explored. RESULTS: Viruses and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected in 75% of the participants. Rhinovirus (48%) was the most commonly detected virus in the participants with single infection, followed by RSV (6%). The median age at admission in the RV group was significantly higher than that in the RSV group. Insufficient asthma control and allergen sensitization were significantly related to RV\u2010associated asthma exacerbation. There was no seasonality of pathogen types associated with asthma exacerbation although a sporadic prevalence of EV\u2010D68 was observehinovirud. Rhinovirus were repeatedly detected in multiple admission cases. CONCLUSION: Our three\u2010year analysis revealed that patients with RV infection were significantly prone to repeated RV infection in the subsequent exacerbation and good asthma control could prevent RV\u2010associated asthma development and exacerbation. Multiple\u2010year monitoring allowed us to comprehend the profile of virus\u2010 and/or mycoplasma\u2010induced asthma exacerbation.","publish_time":"2019-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abe, Nozomi; Yasudo, Hiroki; Fukano, Reiji; Nakamura, Tamaki; Okada, Seigo; Wakiguchi, Hiroyuki; Okazaki, Fumiko; Shirabe, Komei; Toda, Shoichi; Okamoto, Reiko; Ouchi, Kazunobu; Ohga, Shouichi; Hasegawa, Shunji","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b259cbee94cece15bf41eb299c8ae82c18b90d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated asthma exacerbation","asthma exacerbation intensity","induced asthma exacerbation","asthma severity","associated asthma development","subsequent exacerbation","RV group","good asthma control","Insufficient asthma control","participants","childhood asthma exacerbations","profile of virus","detected virus","repeated RV infection","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","rhinovirus","single infection","mycoplasma infections","parainfluenza virus","RSV group","respiratory syncytial virus","epidemiologic profile of causative pathogens","possible factors","multiple admission cases","single center","three\u2010year analysis","three\u2010year period","sporadic prevalence of EV","laboratory data","enterovirus","polymerase chain reaction","attack","reverse transcription","patients","PIV","allergen sensitization","Clinical features","months","asthmatic children","D68","BACKGROUND","seasonality of pathogen types","Nasopharyngeal mucosa cell samples","median age","METHODS","observehinovirud","Viruses","year monitoring","years","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To distinguish adverse events related to ribavirin therapy from those attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to determine the rate of potential ribavirin\u2010related adverse events. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Patients. A cohort of 306 patients with confirmed or probable SARS, 183 of whom received ribavirin and 123 of whom did not, between February 23, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Of the 183 treated patients, 155 (85%) received very high\u2010dose ribavirin; the other 28 treated patients received lower\u2010dose regimens. Measurements and Main Results. Data on all patients with SARS admitted to hospitals in Toronto were abstracted from charts and electronic databases onto a standardized form by trained research nurses. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ribavirin use and each adverse event (progressive anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia) after adjusting for SARS\u2010related prognostic factors and corticosteroid use. In the primary logistic regression analysis, ribavirin use was strongly associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.5\u20136.1, p\u003C0.0001), hypomagnesemia (OR 21, 99% CI 5.8\u201373, p\u003C0.0001), and bradycardia (OR 2.3, 99% CI 1.0\u20135.1, p=0.007). Hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia were not associated with ribavirin use. The risk of anemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia attributable to ribavirin use was 27%, 45%, and 17%, respectively. Conclusions. High\u2010dose ribavirin is associated with a high rate of adverse events. The use of high\u2010dose ribavirin is appropriate only for the treatment of infectious diseases for which ribavirin has proven clinical efficacy, or in the context of a clinical trial.

The intein\u2010encoded protein region is removed by an autocatalytic protein\u2010splicing reaction that ligates the host protein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction can also occur in trans with the intein and host protein split in two. After translation of the two genes, the two intein parts ligate their flanking protein parts to each other, producing the mature protein. Naturally split inteins are only known in the DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (polC or dnaE gene) of a few cyanobacteria. Analysing the phylogenetic distribution and probable genetic propagation mode of these split inteins, we conclude that they are genetically fixed in several large cyanobacterial lineages. To test our hypothesis, we sequenced parts of the dnaE genes from five diverse cyanobacteria and found all species to have the same type of split intein. Our results suggest the occurrence of a genetic rearrangement in the ancestor of a large division of cyanobacteria. This event fixed the dnaE gene in a unique two\u2010genes one\u2010protein configuration in the progenitor of many cyanobacteria. Our hypothesis, findings and the cloning procedure that we established allow the identification and acquisition of many naturally split inteins. Having a large and diverse repertoire of these unique inteins will enable studies of their distinct activity and enhance their use in biotechnology.","publish_time":"2003-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caspi, Jonathan; Amitai, Gil; Belenkiy, Olga; Pietrokovski, Shmuel","journal":"Mol Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f67664515fb5ad87e828b47ce36e28778600f8c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host protein split","split inteins","autocatalytic protein","protein configuration","mature protein","host protein flanks","flanking protein parts","intein parts","unique inteins","type of split intein","encoded protein region","dnaE genes","diverse cyanobacteria","large division of cyanobacteria","genetic rearrangement","genetic elements","hypothesis","large cyanobacterial lineages","probable genetic propagation mode","splicing reaction","diverse repertoire","coding regions of different host proteins","alpha subunit","polC","phylogenetic distribution","ancestor","DNA polymerase","distinct activity","studies","peptide bond","cloning procedure","use","findings","occurrence","identification","species","acquisition","progenitor","biotechnology","results","frame","event","translation"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology of MS indicates that it may be triggered by a virus infection before the age of adolescence, but attempts to associate a specific virus with MS have produced equivocal results. Many studies of the aetiology of MS have postulated that a persistent virus infection is involved, but transient virus infection may provide a plausible alternative mechanism that could explain many of the inconsistencies in MS research. The most studied animal model of MS is chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CREAE), which is induced in susceptible animals following injection of myelin components. While CREAE cannot provide information on the initiating factor for MS, it may mimic disease processes occurring after an initial trigger that may involve transient virus infection. The disease process may comprise separate triggering and relapse phases. The triggering phase may involve sensitisation to myelin antigens as a result of damage to oligodendrocytes or molecular mimicry. The relapse phase could be similar to CREAE, or alternatively relapses may be induced by further transient virus infections which may not involve infection of the CNS, but which may involve the recrudescence of anti\u2010myelin autoimmunity. Although current vaccines have a high degree of biosafety, it is suggested that the measles\u2010mumps\u2010rubella vaccine in particular could be modified to obviate any possibility of triggering anti\u2010myelin autoimmunity.

In this work, the expression and function of CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5 and their ligands during a generalized herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV\u20102) infection in mice were studied. Many CCR1 and CCR5 ligands were expressed in infected organs after intraperitoneal infection. In particular, CC chemokine expression in the liver preceded the expression of CCR1 and CCR5, suggesting recruitment of cells bearing these receptors, which correlated with a decrease in viral titres. Administration of Met\u2010RANTES, a CCR1 and CCR5 antagonist, led to impaired antiviral response with significantly higher viral titre in the liver on days 1 and 6 after infection. This observation was accompanied by a decreased and shortened recruitment of natural killer cells to the peritoneum of infected mice treated with the antagonist. Despite this reduced recruitment of antiviral leucocytes in mice receiving Met\u2010RANTES, peritoneal cells from these mice produced markedly enhanced levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, the results suggest that CCR1 and/or CCR5 are important for both viral clearance and eventual control of the immune response.","publish_time":"2004-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00F8rensen, L.

Much can be learned from pathogens that have evolved to take advantage of the complexity of the lipidome to escape the immune system of the host organism and to allow their survival and replication. Different types of pathogens target different lipids as shown in interaction maps, allowing visualization of differences between different types of pathogens. Bacterial and viral pathogens target predominantly structural and signaling lipids to alter the cellular phenotype of the host cell. Fungal and parasitic pathogens have complex lipidomes themselves and target predominantly the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the host cell lipidome, resulting in the generation of eicosanoids by either the host cell or the pathogen. Thus, whereas viruses and bacteria induce predominantly alterations in lipid metabolites at the host cell level, eukaryotic pathogens focus on interference with lipid metabolites affecting systemic inflammatory reactions that are part of the immune system.

A novel human coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in epidemic form in early 2003 in China and spread worldwide in a few months. Every newly emerging human pathogen is of concern for the safety of the blood supply during and after an epidemic crisis. For this purpose, we have evaluated the inactivation of SARS\u2010coronavirus (CoV) in platelet concentrates using an approved pathogen inactivation device, the INTERCEPT Blood System. Apheresis platelet concentrates (APCs) were inoculated with approximately 10(6) pfu mL(\u22121) of either Urbani or HSR1 isolates of SARS\u2010CoV. The inoculated units were mixed with 150 \u00B5m amotosalen and illuminated with 3 J cm(\u22122) UV\u2010A light. The viral titres were determined by plaque formation in Vero E6 cells. Mixing SARS\u2010CoV with APC in the absence of any treatment decreased viral infectivity by approximately 0\u00B75\u20131 log(10). Following photochemical treatment, SARS\u2010CoV was consistently inactivated to the limit of detection in seven independent APC units. No infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one\u2010third of the APC unit was assayed, demonstrating a mean log(10)\u2010reduction of \u003E6\u00B72. Potent inactivation of SARS\u2010CoV therefore extends the capability of the INTERCEPT Blood System in inactivating a broad spectrum of human pathogens including recently emerging respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinna, D.; Sampson\u2010Johannes, A.; Clementi, M.; Poli, G.; Rossini, S.; Lin, L.; Vicenzi, E.","journal":"Transfus Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71bc25e0857abe7928d1cdf03de8def00ea7e6d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["INTERCEPT Blood System","APC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CoV","Mixing SARS","Potent inactivation of SARS","HSR1 isolates of SARS","emerging human pathogen","INTERCEPT Blood System","novel human coronavirus","blood supply","independent APC units","photochemical treatment","inoculated units","approved pathogen inactivation device","emerging respiratory viruses","Apheresis platelet concentrates","broad spectrum of human pathogens","viral infectivity","epidemic form","viral titres","epidemic crisis","mean log","severe acute respiratory syndrome","plaque formation","concern","absence","capability","Vero E6 cells","safety","limit of detection","\u00B5m amotosalen","China","APCs","Urbani","UV","reduction","infectious virus","light","months","purpose","summary","pfu"],"language":"en"},

Cryopreservation of embryos and primordial germ cells (PGC) is not routinely feasible in birds. The project therefore involved semen frozen in optimal safety and traceable conditions. Whole blood samples were also frozen to provide samples of analyses of genomes and health status. The feasibility of using ex situ conservation, i.e., collecting biological material to be stored outside the usual production area of the species (ex situ genetic stock), to preserve and manage rare breeds was tested with 4 subfertile populations: 3 rare experimental lines used for research into energy metabolism (R\u002B), growth (Y33), and immunity (B4/B4), reared under known health status and the oldest endangered patrimonial French breed, the Gauloise dor\u00E9e with an unknown health status. A general infrastructure was set up for the health screening and remediation of diseases, collection and storage of frozen cells and 2 sites were created for the storage of frozen samples. The screening and remediation of diseases of the Gauloise dor\u00E9e, which was contaminated with various Salmonella and Mycoplasma strains, was achieved by successive treatment of parents, incubated eggs and young chicks with Baytril followed by Tiamulin. For each line, 474 to 994 semen straws have been frozen, thawed, and the semen evaluated. Insemination of frozen-thawed semen into females of the same genetic origin or of an egg-type commercial breed produced chicks in every case. For the most subfertile lines, insemination with egg-type females significantly increased the reproductive success. In conclusion, we report on the benefits of a semen and blood cryobanking complex for the management of endangered lines and strains of domestic birds. Current stocks made possible the restoration of more than 96% of the initial genome. This project also provided technical solutions to resolve some of the health problems frequently encountered for gene preservation in poultry.","publish_time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blesbois, E.; Seigneurin, F.; Grasseau, I.; Limouzin, C.; Besnard, J.; Gourichon, D.; Coquerelle, G.; Rault, P.; Tixier-Boichard, M.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health screening","semen preservation","thawed semen","Insemination of frozen","storage of frozen samples","health problems","semen straws","unknown health status","storage of frozen cells","strains of domestic birds","subfertile lines","blood samples","management of endangered lines","Gauloise dor\u00E9e","egg-type females","rare experimental lines","remediation of diseases","ex situ genetic stock","genetic origin","B4","samples of analyses","project","genetic variability of domestic bird livestock","egg-type commercial breed","ex situ conservation","young chicks","Mycoplasma strains","subfertile populations","optimal safety","gene preservation","safety reasons","rare breeds","oldest endangered patrimonial French breed","primordial germ cells","blood cryobanking complex","increasing risk of line extinction","incubated eggs","species","research","reduction","result","collection","successive treatment of parents","PGC","Baytril","energy metabolism","Cryopreservation of embryos","usual production area","growth","Y33","immunity","benefits","sites","genomes","need","various Salmonella","traceable conditions","Current stocks","restoration","biological material","Tiamulin","feasibility","reproductive success","case","technical solutions","poultry","general infrastructure","initial genome","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In this report the process of fusion-from-within (FFWI) for LAC and other members of the California serogroup of Bunyaviruses is characterized. Like fusion-from-without, FFWI is dependent on pH, temperature, and number of virus particles present in the supernatant of fusing cells. Electron micrographs demonstrate that LAC mediated cell membrane fusion is a rapid, multi-point event, and that other than fusion of their plasma membranes, the cells do not show any morphological change. In agreement with theory, lysosomotropic agents were capable of inhibiting La Crosse virus infection. This inhibition was not due to non-specific toxic effects on infected cells. Finally, fusion studies of other California serogroup members revealed minor differences in the pH of fusion induction in some strains. These differences were consistent with the known subtyping within the serogroup.","publish_time":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pobjecky, Nadine; Smith, Jonathan; Gonzalez-Scarano, Francisco","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAC","FFWI"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["fusion studies","process of fusion","pH of fusion induction","capable of inducing membrane fusion","LAC mediated cell membrane fusion","California serogroup members","Crosse virus infection","California serogroup of Bunyaviruses","infected cells","FFWI","supernatant of fusing cells","number of virus particles present","minor differences","known subtyping","temperature","exposure","non-specific toxic effects","lysosomotropic agents","Electron micrographs","mild acid","multi-point event","theory","enveloped viruses","level","biological significance","agreement","strains","plasma membranes","function","inhibition","mouse model","morphological change","report","organism"],"language":"en"},

The increased number and use of antiviral agents, however, has led to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or hematologic malignancy or those who have undergone organ transplantation. For comprehensive reviews on specific viruses, see references 26, 41, 64, 81\u201383, and 102. Clinical situations that favor the development of resistance include long-term suppressive therapy, recurrent intermittent therapy, and the use of less than optimum doses of an antiviral agent. Generally, the emergence and isolation of drug-resistant viruses is associated more so with the therapeutic use of antiviral agents and does not seem to be caused by prophylactic treatment. As more patients fail to respond to appropriate therapy and additional antiviral agents are produced, it will also become important for diagnostic virology laboratories to provide rapid and practical antiviral susceptibility testing to assist physicians in defining drug resistance and choosing appropriate alternative therapies. This review describes the major antiviral agents, their mechanisms of action, and the development of drug resistance following antiviral therapy. A brief overview of the available phenotypic and genotypic susceptibility assays for detecting antiviral resistance is also discussed.","publish_time":"1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hodinka, Richard L.","journal":"Infect Dis Clin North Am","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b92a8d80e9238a7649226aec555ee577f61df262.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral therapy","antiviral resistance","major antiviral agents","additional antiviral agents","therapeutic use of antiviral agents","development of drug resistance","development of resistance","practical antiviral susceptibility testing","expanding array of antiviral drugs","appropriate therapy","resistant viruses","emergence of drug","isolation of drug","specific viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","varicella-zoster virus","human immunodeficiency virus type","long-term suppressive therapy","recurrent intermittent therapy","herpes simplex virus types","HSV","number of viral infections","management of infections","successful treatment","immunocompromised patients","increased number","prophylactic treatment","genotypic susceptibility assays","acquired immunodeficiency syndrome","appropriate alternative therapies","RSV","influenza","physicians","diagnostic virology laboratories","AIDS","HIV","VZV","mechanisms of action","papillomaviruses","hematologic malignancy","hepatitis B","CMV","optimum doses","brief overview","comprehensive reviews","cytomegalovirus","references","significant advances","Clinical situations","decade","organ transplantation"],"language":"en"},

It is a matter of controversy whether acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a distinct clinical entity. This is the first Asian report on acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome to be made outside Japan. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1999, 8,085 patients underwent total colonoscopy at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and colonoscopic files. The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome was made by means of the clinical, histologic, and colonoscopic findings. RESULTS: Among the 8,085 patients, 19 patients (11 males; mean age, 71.2 \u00B1 10.1 years) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome, which accounted for 2.8 percent of the patients with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The duration from hospitalization to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9 \u00B1 3.3) days. Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance were solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s), with round, circumferential, geographical, or Dieulafoy-like lesions located within a mean of 4.7 cm \u00B1 1.5 cm from the dentate line. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, which is considered to be similar to stress-related mucosa injury. Successful hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients with direct therapeutic maneuvers. Prognosis was largely dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSIONS: We assert that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare but important entity and stress that awareness of this clinical entity should lead to a high index of suspicion resulting in early detection, diagnosis, and appropriate therapy.","publish_time":"2004-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Chang-An; Chen, Li-Tzong; Tsai, Kun-Bow; Su, Yu-Chung; Wu, Deng-Chyang; Jan, Chang-Ming; Wang, Wen-Ming; Pan, Yong-Sang","journal":"Dis Colon Rectum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ba728305beeae3e2857f7e6245184f7ea3c9498.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177015.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome","multiple rectal ulcer","patients","massive hemorrhage","onset of massive bleeding","distinct clinical entity","accurate diagnosis","important entity","colonoscopic files","colonoscopic findings","underlying stroma","underlying disorders","percent","lesions","mean age","massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding","Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance","serious underlying illnesses","sudden onset","multiple thrombi","stress-related mucosa injury","early detection","Asian report","epithelium","high index of suspicion","management","vessels","awareness","matter of controversy","PURPOSE","necrosis","denudation","hospitalization","round","males","years","appropriate therapy","Dieulafoy","medical records","Prognosis","total colonoscopy","institution","direct therapeutic maneuvers","Successful hemostasis","Histopathologically","duration","CONCLUSIONS","Japan","dentate line","days","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The supervision and analysis of population migration are necessary for guiding the optimal allocation of urban resources and for attaining the high efficiency development of region. Currently, the explorations of population migration are often restricted by the limitation of data. In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chun; He, Jianhua; Duan, Xingwu","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0a8f3f50f3e29aa83c57f75cfbe572480bf1408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177813.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Baidu"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["analysis of population migration","Rapid population migration","explorations of population migration","population migration inner regions","public migration attention","migration attention indexes","accumulation of cyber search query data","search engines","large-scope search query data","delineation of specific population flow","public attention","cyber MAIs","cyber space","limitation of data","Baidu search engine","intercity-MAI","external-MAI","local-MAI","urban network construction","major urban agglomerations","regional sustainable development","optimal allocation of urban resources","regional phenomena","correlation analysis","geographical space","potential individual actions","high efficiency development of region","case study","China","helpful supplement","critical factor","holistic lens","information era","supervision","problems","Results","possibility","paper"],"language":"en"},

Several reports have described resistance of Tmprss2(\u2212/\u2212) knock-out (KO) mice to IAV infection but IAV of the H2 subtype have not been examined yet. Here, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is able to cleave H2-HA in cell culture and that Tmprss2(\u2212/\u2212) mice are resistant to infection with a re-assorted PR8_HA(H2) virus. Infection of KO mice did not cause major body weight loss or death. Furthermore, no significant increase in lung weights and no virus replication were observed in Tmprss2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Finally, only minor tissue damage and infiltration of immune cells were detected and no virus-positive cells were found in histological sections of Tmprss2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. In summary, our studies indicate that TMPRSS2 is required for H2 IAV spread and pathogenesis in mice. These findings extend previous results pointing towards a central role of TMPRSS2 in IAV infection and validate host proteases as a potential target for antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambertz, Ruth Lydia Olga; Gerhauser, Ingo; Nehlmeier, Inga; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Winkler, Michael; Leist, Sarah Rebecca; Kollmus, Heike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Schughart, Klaus","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/752ef5a274cd1951d1b1d103511a647ba054a9d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV infection","H2 IAV","resistance of Tmprss2","Infection of KO mice","H2-HA","central role of TMPRSS2","histological sections of Tmprss2","host cell protease TMPRSS2","virus replication","H2 subtype","virus-positive cells","host proteases","cell culture","infiltration of immune cells","influenza","re-assorted PR8","major body weight loss","potential target","lung weights","minor tissue damage","previous results","death","hemagglutinin","antiviral therapy","significant increase","knock","pathogenesis","findings","summary","studies","reports"],"language":"en"},

However, JHM virus is assembled intracellularly by budding at surfaces of smooth membranous vacuoles. A comparison of JHMvirus replication in L2 and 17C1-1 cell lines revealed that L2 cells undergo more rapid cytopathology and cease virus production much sooner than 17C1-1 cells. In L2 cells the accumulation of core material appears to continue after the abrupt cessation of virus assembly. This is evident by the massive cytoplasmic accumulation of structures resembling nucleocapsids, which react with hybridoma antibody to the nucleocapsid antigen as demonstrated by the immunoperoxidase procedure.

Our hypothesis was that in primary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) MV would enhance inflammation and edema in the abdomen. METHODS: Thirteen piglets were randomized into two groups (SB and MV) after the induction of ARDS by lung lavage and 1 h of injurious ventilation. 1. SB: continuous positive airway pressure 15 cmH(2)O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) 0.5 and respiratory rate (RR) maintained at about 40 cycles min(\u2212 1) by titrating remifentanil infusion. 2. MV: volume control, tidal volume 6 ml kg(\u2212 1), positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH(2)O, RR 40 cycles min(\u2212 1), FIO(2) 0.5. Main outcomes: abdominal edema, assessed by tissues histopathology and wet-dry weight; abdominal inflammation, assessed by cytokine concentration in tissues, blood and ascites, and tissue histopathology. RESULTS: The groups did not show significant differences in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. Moreover, edema and inflammation in the abdominal organs were similar. However, blood IL6 increased in the MV group in all vascular beds (p \u003C 0.001).

Increased migration levels typically result in increased economic growth indicators, making amenity migration an attractive rural development strategy. But comprehensive econometric analysis focused on amenity migration in the American West has been lacking. To address this, we conducted an econometric analysis of attributes that influenced migration to rural Western counties from 1980 to 2010. Over 20 potential amenity supply categories were collated for 356 rural counties from 11 Western states, with a focus on public lands. Descriptive statistics and OLS regressions were estimated and interpreted. Traditional amenities of climate, water area, and regional access were highly associated with migration levels, while designated natural amenities of Wilderness and National Monuments were the most influential public lands for migration to rural Western counties. Farming and oil and gas dependency were negatively associated with migration levels. Increasing the amount of protected areas, and branding campaigns based on natural amenities, can be a critical development strategy for rural communities.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hjerpe, Evan; Hussain, Anwar; Holmes, Thomas","journal":"Environ Manage","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b82f5f95c6b8667d5848277cc8c3d9b46d03252.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OLS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rural amenity migration","rural counties","Increased migration levels","rural Western counties","rural communities","attractive rural development strategy","certain regional amenities","natural amenities of Wilderness","Traditional amenities of climate","Western states","migrants","American West","potential amenity supply categories","influential public lands","critical development strategy","econometric analysis of attributes","comprehensive econometric analysis","regional access","increased economic growth indicators","National Monuments","water area","relocation","branding campaigns","considerable influence","quality of life purposes","gas dependency","focus","monetary enhancement","Descriptive statistics","OLS regressions","Farming","oil","protected areas","places","phenomenon","Researchers","decades"],"language":"en"},

It occurs worldwide, creating a very heavy burden in many developing countries, including Nepal. Dogs are the principle vector for the transmission of this disease in urban areas. Vaccination is the most important preventive measure in areas where dogs are the principle source of infection. This study was conducted with the aim of detecting virus-neutralising antibodies and associated factors against rabies in vaccinated household dogs of Kathmandu valley. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 110 vaccinated pet dogs in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur districts of Nepal. The samples were taken to the laboratory of the National Zoonosis and Food Hygiene Research Center where serum was separated. An indirect immune-enzymatic assay (Platelia(TM) Rabies II kit ad usum Veterinarium, Biorad, China) was used for the detection of rabies virus anti-glycoprotein antibodies in the dog serum samples following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and instructions. Optical density values for unknown samples were compared with the positive sera titers in quantification tests obtained after a direct reading on the standard curve. Results were expressed as equivalent units per ml (EU/ml). FINDINGS: Of the total samples, 89.09% exceeded the required seroconversion level (\u2265 0.5 EU/ml); another 9.09% did not reach the seroconversion level (0.125\u20130.5 EU/ml); and 1.81% had undetectable seroconversion levels (\u003C0.125 EU/ml) suggesting that the animal had not seroconverted according to the PLATELIA(\u2122) RABIES II test. Only one factor, the condition under which the dog was kept, was significantly associated with the antibody titer level. No association was found for any of the other factors included in the study.

This paper describes the reflective practice of a nurse manager in Hong Kong in supporting frontline nurses to overcome the crisis of SARS. Background. SARS infection was a crisis for everyone in endemic areas because of its threat to physical and emotional health. Hong Kong was the second leading endemic area in the world. Inadequate supplies of protective devices and the death of a nurse infected with SARS triggered nurses\u2019 negative emotions. Methods. A model of structured reflection was adopted to examine one\u0027s practice. A problem\u2010solving model for crisis intervention was integrated into the reflective stage of structured reflection. Results. Promotion of nurses\u2019 safety and emotional stability were the major goals in handling the crisis. Strategies were employed including self\u2010awareness, empowerment and team building, information sharing, provision of personal protective equipment and emotional support for frontline nurses. Conclusions. SARS infection threatens the physical and emotional health of nurses. From a positive perspective, such a crisis created an opportunity to learn and grow in terms of ethical, personal and aesthetic arenas. Relevance to clinical practice. SARS epidemic raised worldwide attention and challenged the Hong Kong\u0027s health care system. Reflective practice is useful to guide and examine nurses\u2019 professional action during the crisis, and to put the experience into a learning perspective.","publish_time":"2005-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Pui Yi; Chan, Carmen WH","journal":"J Clin Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d534a8bc2e73ffc28367ff3ac5bd73cac2f68a29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["crisis of SARS","crisis intervention","reflective practice","SARS infection","emotional health of nurses","SARS epidemic","emotional stability","emotional support","frontline nurses","clinical practice","reflective stage of structured reflection","model of structured reflection","Hong Kong\u0027s health care system","Promotion of nurses\u2019 safety","nurses\u2019 professional action","nurses\u2019 negative emotions","provision of personal protective equipment","nurse manager","endemic areas","problem\u2010solving model","learning perspective","positive perspective","leading endemic area","Inadequate supplies of protective devices","information sharing","empowerment","team building","worldwide attention","death","threat","major goals","self\u2010awareness","terms of ethical","aesthetic arenas","experience","Strategies","Relevance","opportunity","paper","objectives","Background","Conclusions","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

We analysed histological changes induced by coronavirus MHV\u2010JHM infection in Lewis rats. Besides an acute disease (AE), chronic panencephalitis (CPE) and subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) were induced. These disease types were differentiated by the incubation period, the localization of lesions, the type of tissue damage and distribution of virus antigen. In AE and CPE, virus antigen was detected in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whereas in SDE neurons lacked virus antigen. Viral nucleocapsid protein (N) was present in the cytoplasm and the spike protein (S) was displayed on the surface of infected neural cells. However, expression of S protein relative to N protein was severely impaired in SDE lesions. Quantitative analysis of infiltrating inflammatory cells revealed that the number of macrophages and T cells were similar in lesions of AE, CPE and SDE. In contrast to that, SDE lesions contained a significantly higher number of IgG\u2020 B cells and plasma cells. In addition active demyelinating SDE lesions displayed an enhanced IgG content and deposits of complement C9. These results indicate that virus induced primary demyelination could be a consequence of antibody mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of cells producing spike protein in the chronic forms of the disease indicates down\u2010regulation of this protein, possibly mediated by anti\u2010S antibodies.","publish_time":"2008-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"ZIMPRICH, F.; WINTER, J.; WEGE, H.; LASSMANN, H.","journal":"Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2f9b1e0882eb3c6ac0f57f309f38b48e92da562.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["AE","SDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of cells","N protein","lesions of AE","spike protein","SDE neurons","B cells","T cells","plasma cells","addition active demyelinating SDE lesions","localization of lesions","CPE","expression of S protein relative","Viral nucleocapsid protein","distribution of virus antigen","surface of infected neural cells","higher number of IgG","Coronavirus MHV","number of macrophages","Quantitative analysis of infiltrating inflammatory cells","subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis","disease types","acute disease","JHM infection of rodents","anti\u2010S antibodies","chronic panencephalitis","chronic forms","enhanced IgG content","consequence of antibody mediated cytotoxicity","type of tissue damage","cytoplasm","deposits of complement C9","primary demyelination","incubation period","Lewis rats","oligodendrocytes","astrocytes","histological changes","results","regulation","reduction","contrast"],"language":"en"},

We sequenced and analyzed two new PRVC strains, RV0104 (G3), and RV0143 (G6) and compared their pathogenesis with that of the historic strain Cowden (G1) in gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Near complete genome sequence analysis confirmed that these two strains were distinct from one another and the Cowden strain. VP1, VP2, VP6, NSP1-NSP3, and NSP5 genes were more similar between Cowden and RV0143, whereas VP3, VP7, and NSP4 shared higher nucleotide identity between Cowden and RV0104. Three-day-old and 3-week-old Gn piglets were inoculated with 10(5) FFU/piglet of Cowden, RV0104 or RV0143, or mock. All 3-day-old piglets developed severe diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy, with mean PRVC fecal shedding titers peaking and numerically higher in RV0104 and RV0143 piglets on post infection day (PID) 2. Histopathological examination of the small intestine revealed that the 3-day-old Cowden and RV0104 inoculated piglets were mildly affected, while significant destruction of small intestinal villi was observed in the RV0143 inoculated piglets. Consistent with the highest degree of pathological changes in the small intestines, the RV0143 inoculated piglets had numerically higher levels of serum IL-17 and IFN-\u03B1 cytokines and numerically lower PRVC IgA geometric mean antibody titers. Milder pathological changes and overall higher titers of PRVC IgA antibodies were observed in 3-week-old vs. 3-day-old piglets. Additionally, diarrhea was only observed in RV0104 and RV0143 (but not Cowden) inoculated 3-week-old piglets, while levels of serum IL-10 and PRVC IgA antibodies were higher in Cowden inoculated pigs, consistent with the lack of diarrhea. Thus, we confirmed that these current, genetically heterogeneous PRVC strains possess distinct pathobiological characteristics that may contribute to the increased prevalence of PRVC diarrhea in neonatal suckling piglets.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chepngeno, Juliet; Takanashi, Sayaka; Diaz, Annika; Michael, Husheem; Paim, Francine C.; Rahe, Michael C.; Hayes, Jeffrey R.; Baker, Courtney; Marthaler, Douglas; Saif, Linda J.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5938d8f94a0ddb2495908832870025867868a892.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197332.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRVC","PRVC IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV0143 piglets","RV0143 inoculated piglets","RV0104 inoculated piglets","week-old piglets","day-old piglets","day-old Cowden","distinct PRVC strains","Cowden inoculated pigs","new PRVC strains","Cowden strain","week-old Gn piglets","heterogeneous PRVC strains","piglet of Cowden","higher titers of PRVC IgA antibodies","neonatal suckling piglets","increased prevalence of PRVC diarrhea","historic strain Cowden","mean PRVC fecal shedding titers","lower PRVC IgA geometric mean antibody titers","higher levels of serum IL","severe diarrhea","lack of diarrhea","higher nucleotide identity","small intestines","Milder pathological changes","distinct pathobiological characteristics","significant destruction of small intestinal villi","emergence of new","highest degree of pathological changes","increased prevalence of porcine group C rotavirus","post infection day","associated significant economic losses","lethargy","NSP4","anorexia","G3","NSP1-NSP3","IFN-\u03B1 cytokines","NSP5 genes","G1","VP7","gnotobiotic","VP2","VP6","PID","VP3","complete genome sequence analysis","VP1","pathogenesis","Histopathological examination","G6","FFU","swine industry","mock"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: To study the importance of abdominal sonograms in neonatal foals suffering from gastrointestinal conditions and to describe the clinical features of necrotising gastrointestinal disease. Hypothesis: There is a subgroup of neonates with sonographically detectable pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), reflecting a necrotising disease. Methods: Records of foals aged \u22647 days hospitalised from 2005 to 2009 with signs of gastrointestinal disease were evaluated (n = 89). The association of sonographic, clinical and clinicopathological signs with necrotising gastrointestinal disease and outcome was determined. Results: PI was imaged in 19 foals. Twenty\u2010seven foals were classified as having necrotising gastrointestinal disease based on the presence of gastrointestinal signs (colic, diarrhoea, gastric reflux or abdominal distension) and sonographic PI (n = 19), surgical (n = 2) or pathological (n = 6) evidence of gastrointestinal necrosis. There was a difference between survival rate in foals with and without necrotising disease (33.3 and 69.4%, respectively, P = 0.005) or foals with and without PI detected sonographically (36.8 and 72.1%, respectively, P = 0.023). PI was the only sonographic finding associated with outcome. Prematurity, the presence of blood in the faeces, gastric reflux, abdominal distension, abnormal echogenicity of the colon and the lowest white blood cell count during hospitalisation were associated with necrotising gastrointestinal disease (P\u003C0.05). Conclusions and potential relevance: Abdominal sonograms have prognostic value in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. PI and the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease were common and associated with a poor prognosis.","publish_time":"2012-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"NAVAS de SOLIS, C.; PALMER, J.

RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L contains 2 attenuating elements: (1) deletion of the interferon antagonist NS2 gene and (2) deletion of codon 1313 of the RSV polymerase gene and the stabilizing missense mutation I1314L. This live vaccine candidate was temperature-sensitive, genetically stable, replication restricted, and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. METHODS: A single intranasal dose of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (vaccine-placebo ratio, 2:1) at 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) in 15 RSV-seropositive children and at 10(5) and 10(6) PFU in 21 and 30 RSV-seronegative children, respectively. RESULTS: In RSV-seronegative children, the 10(5) PFU dose was overattenuated, but the 10(6) PFU dose was well tolerated, infectious (RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L replication detected in 90% of vaccinees), and immunogenic (geometric mean serum RSV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titer, 1:64). After the RSV season, 9 of 20 vaccinees had increases in the RSV titer that were significantly greater than those in 8 of 10 placebo recipients (1:955 vs 1:69, respectively), indicating that the vaccine primed for anamnestic responses after natural RSV exposure. CONCLUSION: Rational design yielded a genetically stable candidate RSV vaccine that is attenuated yet immunogenic in RSV-seronegative children, warranting further evaluation.

Tadham Moor in Somerset, England, is an exceptionally rich wetland site which has been mown for hay for many years, with stock grazing the aftermath, but with no history of any fertilizer use. A randomized blocks field experiment (1986\u20131989) was used to study the effects of five levels of nitrogen input treatments: 0 = control, 25, 50, 100 and 200 kg of N fertilizer per ha per yr. In Phase II of the experiment (1990\u20131993), each plot was split into two subplots. The allocated fertilizer treatment for the plot was continued in one, randomly selected, subplot but the treatment was discontinued in the other subplot. The experiment not only identified and quantified the changes occurring in the vegetation of hay meadows under different levels of N input, it also provided valuable insight into the dynamics of the sward upon the discontinuance of the treatments. The data for Phase II were used to estimate the time required by the changed vegetation (under different nitrogen treatments) to revert to a state comparable to that prevailing in the control plots. A method for estimating reversion times is described. The main difficulties in estimating the reversion times are identified, the choice of robust vegetation variables being critical. Reversion time estimation methods are presented and used to obtain working estimates for the four nitrogen treatments, applied for 5 yr. These estimates are 3, 5, 7 and 9 yr respectively. The validity of the estimates of 3 yr for the lowest nitrogen input treatment (25 kg /ha/yr) was checked using the available post cessation data.","publish_time":"2009-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mountford, J.O.; Lakhani, K.H.; Holland, R.J.","journal":"J Veg Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ee9ea343b915c3d719e2059386bdd63c477135b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tadham Moor"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different nitrogen treatments","levels of nitrogen input treatments","yr","lowest nitrogen input treatment","N fertilizer","allocated fertilizer treatment","estimating reversion times","different levels of N input","vegetation of hay meadows","changed vegetation","fertilizer use","working estimates","Phase","Reversion time estimation methods","choice of robust vegetation variables","randomized blocks field experiment","control plots","available post cessation data","England","dynamics","sward","valuable insight","aftermath","Tadham Moor","Somerset","rich wetland site","years","stock","history","discontinuance","main difficulties","effects","state comparable","changes","validity","subplots"],"language":"en"},

We desired minimal inconvenience for participants in residential indoor environmental quality and health studies. Accuracy, precision, and method detection limits (MDLs) were investigated. Overall, MDLs ranged from 0.6 to 25 cell/cm(2) on sampled floors. Overall measurement precisions expressed as the coefficient of variation because of sample processing and qPCR ranged 6\u201363%. Median and maximum fungal concentrations in house dust in study homes in Visalia, Tulare County, California, were 110 and 2500 cell/cm(2), respectively, with universal fungal primers (allergenic and nonallergenic species). The field study indicated samplings in multiple seasons were necessary to characterize representative whole\u2010year fungal concentrations in residential microenvironments. This was because significant temporal variations were observed within study homes. Combined field and laboratory results suggested this modified new wipe sampling method, in conjunction with growth\u2010independent qPCR, shows potential to improve human exposure and health studies for fungal pathogens and allergens in dust in homes of susceptible, vulnerable population subgroups.

Reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat. We tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an RNA virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host. We subjected four populations of the RNA bacteriophage \u03C66 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host. Although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment, three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts. In the most extreme case, one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild\u2010type \u03C66. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change, highlighting the ease with which an emerging RNA virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor. Our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations. Furthermore, our data confirm the biological credibility of simple \u201Cno\u2010gene\u201D mechanisms of assortative mating, in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation.","publish_time":"2007-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duffy, Siobain; Burch, Christina L.; Turner, Paul E.","journal":"Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/750dfd866153a109c1a461338a8542dad382a37f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of reproductive isolation","resulting reproductive isolation","laboratory populations","host range","novel host","emerging RNA virus","allopatric experimental populations","RNA bacteriophage \u03C66","multiple virus genotypes","mechanisms of assortative mating","ecological adaptation","type \u03C66","hosts infectible","alternative hosts","Ecological speciation hypotheses","ease","genetic exchange","pleiotropic effect of genes responsible","generations of","evolutionary fate","phytophagous insects","biological credibility of simple","consequence of divergent","single nucleotide change","genome sequencing","species","data","direct selection","important traits","habitats","ancestor","ability","extreme case","expectation","results"],"language":"en"},

We investigate the role of dynamical correlations on the 2SCP on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks using pairwise mean-field theory. This approach is compared with the ordinary one-site theory and stochastic simulations. We show that our approach significantly outperforms the one-site theory. In particular, the stationary state of the 2SCP model on random regular networks is very accurately reproduced by the pairwise mean-field, even for relatively small values of vertex degree, where expressive deviations of the standard mean-field are observed. The pairwise approach is also able to capture the transition points accurately for heterogeneous networks and provides rich phase diagrams with transitions not predicted by the one-site method.

We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables.

All surgically treated patients with CDE or Bochdalek type CDH between 2000 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Demographics, CDH-characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcome were evaluated. In total, 200 patients were included. Patients with an eventration or hernia sac had no significant differences and were compared as patients without a true defect to patients with a true defect. The 1-year survival of patients with a true defect was significantly lower than patients with no true defect (76% versus 97%, p = 0.001). CDH with no true defect had significantly better short-term outcomes than CDH with true defect requiring patch repair.

However, the recurrence rate and duration of oxygen supplementation at 30 days are higher than CDH patients with a true defect.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heiwegen, Kim; van Heijst, Arno FJ; Daniels-Scharbatke, Horst; van Peperstraten, Michelle CP; de Blaauw, Ivo; Botden, Sanne MBI","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45c01cfea1d298f03cb97a81d0687ec22244efed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["true defect","CDH patients","hernia sac patients","treated patients","year survival of patients","CDH-characteristics","congenital diaphragmatic hernia","Bochdalek type CDH","Congenital diaphragmatic eventration","CDE","better survival","days","higher recurrence rate","different types of congenital diaphragmatic malformations","duration of oxygen supplementation","similar clinical outcome","better short-term outcomes","treatment","significant differences","patch repair","Demographics","study","Conclusion","retrospective analysis","total"],"language":"en"},

The severity of gambling in Australia is characterised by unprecedented gambling expenditures and losses representing the highest gambling rates in the world, which has led to renewed interests in understanding the factors influencing gambling behaviours. We contribute to the debate on the determinants of gambling by providing the first study that examines the impact of ethnic diversity on gambling. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that ethnic diversity is positively associated with gambling. This result is robust to alternative estimation approaches, alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and irrespective of whether gambling is measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index, gambling expenditures or number of gambling activities. Our results also suggest stronger effects of ethnic diversity for problem gamblers compared to gamblers in other risk categories. These results support the need for policies that promote social capital in diverse communities to reduce the risks of social isolation, which is an important motivator of gambling behaviour.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Awaworyi Churchill, Sefa; Farrell, Lisa","journal":"J Gambl Stud","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2e67ae1c423f12170d2c425afddb4464edce387.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222045.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Labour Dynamics"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["severity of gambling","determinants of gambling","gambling behaviours","unprecedented gambling expenditures","highest gambling rates","number of gambling activities","Problem Gambling Severity Index","important motivator of gambling behaviour","impact of ethnic diversity","stronger effects of ethnic diversity","problem gamblers","Australia survey","results","alternative ways","social capital","alternative estimation approaches","risks of social isolation","Income","losses","significant public health issue","diverse communities","Labour Dynamics","policies","popular leisure activity","Household","need","factors","world","renewed interests","study","risk categories","data","debate"],"language":"en"},

Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to reduce morbidity and mortality by 90 and 95%, respectively, between 2015 and 2035. Although diagnostics, therapeutics, and a vaccine are available, it is beyond doubt that better intervention measures are needed to accomplish this ambitious goal. The vaccine bacille Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin (BCG) partially protects infants against TB, but it is virtually ineffective against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults. The efficacy of this vaccine, however, has not yet been fully exploited. In addition, new vaccine candidates are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Because a quarter of all people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), new vaccines must be applied not only prior to infection (pre-exposure vaccination) but also after infection (postexposure vaccination). Prevention of infection, prevention of disease, and prevention of recurrence are currently assessed as clinical endpoints. Because protection against TB is primarily mediated by T lymphocytes, TB vaccine development focuses on protective T cell responses. Protein adjuvant formulations, viral vectors, and killed and live bacterial vaccines are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination is clinically tested, notably in adjunct to canonical drug therapy to multiresistant TB. It is likely that a single vaccine cannot accomplish the various indications and that different vaccination strategies are required.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaufmann, Stefan H.

Subperiosteal bone formation and generalized osteosclerosis are the most common radiological findings. Here we present a new case with RS. A 9-month-old male patient on a home-type ventilator was referred for hypophosphatemia. He was born with a weight of 3800 g to non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal ultrasound had demonstrated nasal bone agenesis. A large anterior fontanel, frontal bossing, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose, high arched palate, low set ears, triangular mouth, and corneal opacification were detected on physical examination. Serial skeletal X-rays revealed diffuse osteosclerosis at birth which was gradually decreased by the age of 5 months with subperiosteal undermineralized bone formation and medullary space of long bone could be distinguishable with bone-within-a-bone appearance. At 9 months of age, hand X-ray revealed cupping of the ulna with loose radial bone margin with minimal fraying and osteopenia. Cranial computed tomography scan showed bilateral periventricular calcification and hydrocephalus in progress. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological examinations were consistent with RS. Molecular analyses revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in FAM20C gene (a known pathogenic mutation, c.1645C \u003E T, p.Arg549Trp; and a novel c.863 \u002B 5 G \u003E C variant). The patient died due to respiratory failure at 17 months of age. This case allowed us to demonstrate natural progression of skeletal features in RS. Furthermore, we have described a novel FAM20C variant causing RS. Previous literature on RS is also reviewed.

Last summer, two patients with C. Auris infections were admitted at University of Chicago Medicine (UCM). Environmental samples were collected to assess environmental contamination before and after cleaning. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected using 3M Sponge Sticks with neutralizing Buffer during one patient\u00D5s stay, weeks after another patient\u00D5s stay, and after enhanced terminal cleaning. Samples were cultured directly and yeast was identified using MALDI. The following surfaces were sampled: Bathroom sink drain, bedside table, bedrail, mattress, chair and window ledge. Routine terminal cleaning includes 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied high touch surfaces of both room and bathroom. The enhanced terminal cleaning process used for these rooms included: (1) 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied to all high touch surfaces and walls; (2) privacy curtains removed and replaced; (3) supervision by environmental services manager; and (4) single UV disinfection cycle in room and bathroom. RESULTS: Because of delay in identification of C auris for the first patient, pre-clean samples were taken \u003E2 weeks after the patient had been discharged. During the intervening weeks, multiple patients had occupied the room and there had been \u003E3 routine terminal cleanings. None of these samples were positive for C auris. Pre-clean, in-residence samples indicated C auris contamination of multiple surfaces for the second patient. Because of transfers within the institution, there are three sets of post-cleaning cultures for the second patient. All post-clean environmental cultures were negative for both patients. Results are shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: Candida auris can contaminate environmental surfaces. While routine terminal cleaning may have been effective in removing C auris from surfaces in one patient\u00D5s room, the enhanced terminal cleaning strategy used here was effective in our facility.

The Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance program monitors hospitalizations due to acute respiratory illness and conducts systematic testing for several respiratory pathogens. We assessed viruses detected by the hospital and additional detections identified by expanded testing. METHODS: Residual upper respiratory specimens collected from patients hospitalized for suspected respiratory illness for routine diagnostic testing at three hospitals, including one children\u2019s hospital, were submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Specimens were tested for 18 respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Clinical and hospital test data were collected through medical record review. RESULTS: From September 2015 to August 2016, 2,351 hospitalized SARI patients were reported, with the following age distribution: 57% \u003C5 years, 13% 5\u201317 years, 30% \u226518 years. Among all SARI patients, 97% (2,273) had hospital-based, clinician-directed testing for viral pathogens. Viruses were detected among 47% (1,077) of tested patients, among which testing methods included PCR (85%), rapid antigen (13%), and culture (2%); 74% were tested on the day of admission. Most common viruses detected by clinical testing included respiratory syncytial virus (41%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (31%), and influenza (15%) (Figure 1). Systematic RT\u2013PCR testing at MDH identified 1,600 (68%) patients positive for \u22651 respiratory virus, identifying previously unknown detections among 35% (820) of SARI patients (Figure 2). Of 1,272 patients with no virus identified at the hospital, 46% (586) had a viral detection at MDH. Patients aged \u003C18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged \u226518 years (P \u003C 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

Symptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Adenovirus Upper Respiratory Tract Infections Increase the Risk of Invasive Aspergillosis After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy209.055","pmcid":"PMC6252578","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious infectious complication following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Few studies have reported respiratory viral infections (RVIs) as a risk factor for developing IA, and data regarding specific viruses is sparse. We examined whether specific respiratory viruses were associated with increased risk of developing IA post-HCT. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of RVIs among allogeneic HCT recipients conducted 2005\u20132010, weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100, then every 3 months, and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred through 1 year post-HCT. Nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were tested by multiplex PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV)1\u20134, influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus (ADV), and human rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Only respiratory virus detections with symptoms were counted as RVI. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine adjusted associations between each RVI and the development of first proven/probable IA by 1-year post-HCT. RESULTS: Among 437 patients who survived \u003E28 days following HCT, 39 patients developed IA by 1-year post-HCT (median 87 days, range 5\u2013283). After adjusting for age at HCT, neutropenia, high-grade CMV viremia, and HLA status (matched related vs. others) or severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD Grade 0\u20132 vs. 3\u20134), RSV and ADV upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) were associated with increased risk of developing IA (figure). Detection of any respiratory virus in the BAL was associated with IA (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: RSV and ADV URTI are significant risk factors for development of IA post-HCT; the association between PIV URTI and development of IA approached statistical significance. Viral lower respiratory tract infection was associated with IA. Our data provide a rationale to assess IA as an endpoint in preventive studies of novel agents for respiratory viruses and further emphasize the importance of effective infection prevention practices for RVIs after HCT.

More recent research in landscape ecology has produced an expanded view of ecotones and elaboration of their characteristics and functions in ecosystems. Parallel research on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and the causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission, spread, and adaptation suggests a correspondence between ecotonal processes and the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for zoonotic and vector-borne emerging infections. A review of the literature suggests that ecotones play a role in a number of the most important EIDs. Yet these are the only diseases for which specific landscape ecological information exists in the literature or disease reports. However, the similar disease ecologies of these with about half of the approximately 130 zoonotic EIDs suggests ecotones, particularly their anthropogenic origination or modification, may be generally associated with ecotones and the global trend of increasing EIDs.","publish_time":"2006-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Despommier, Dickson; Ellis, Brett R.; Wilcox, Bruce A.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1161cb8edcaa66b012416fafc188a462ed847aff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic EIDs","zoonotic disease research","ecological sciences","ecological systems","important EIDs","specific landscape ecological information","expanded view of ecotones","Parallel research","literature","recent research","disease reports","global trend of increasing EIDs","emerging infectious diseases","similar disease ecologies","ecotonal processes","landscape ecology","emerging infections","evolutionary processes responsible","vector","causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission","adaptation","elaboration","characteristics","significance","boundary","long history","correspondence","number","half","anthropogenic origination","functions","role","ecosystems","modification","Recognition","review"],"language":"en"},

(ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Further evaluation of the potential of flow cytometry in rapid viral diagnosis is warranted.","publish_time":"2002-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnston, S.L.; Dalal, A.; Mason, S.; Wilson, J.W.; Robinson, B.S.; Holgate, S.T.","journal":"Clin Diagn Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of flow cytometry","rapid viral diagnosis","diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection","negative predictive values of flow cytometry","virus infected","established techniques of viral isolation","rapid detection of respiratory viral antigens","common respiratory viral pathogens","rapid diagnostic techniques","routine virological diagnosis","negative clinical samples","combined established techniques","non-infected cells","models of positive","populations of infected","study design","uninfected cultured cells","immunofluorescent microscopy","method","naso-pharyngeal aspirates","children","virology laboratory","specificity","identification","sensitivity","evaluation","Objectives","Hypotheses","definitions","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

In retroviruses, synthesis of pol gene products necessitates either readthrough of a stop codon or frameshifting. Here we present an experimental system that permits quantification of translational errors in vivo. It consists of a family of expression vectors carrying different mutated versions of the luc gene as reporter. Mutations include both an in-frame stop codon and 1-base-pair deletions that require readthough or frameshift, respectively, to give rise to an active product. This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in mammalian cells. In addition, one of the vectors contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of interest. This latter vector was used to analyse the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level slippage at the gag-pol junction of HIV. The effect of paromomycin and kasugamycin, two antibiotics known to influence translational ambiguity, was also tested in cultured cells. The results indicate that paromomycin diversely affects readthrough and frameshifting, while kasugamycin had no effect. This family of vectors can be used to analyse the influence of structural and external factors on translational ambiguity in both mammalian cells and bacteria.","publish_time":"2002-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cassan, M.; Berteaux, V.; Angrand, P.-O.; Rousset, J.-P.","journal":"Res Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translational ambiguity","quantification of translational errors","gene expression","mammalian cells","family of vectors","effect of paromomycin","family of expression vectors","readthrough","luc gene","background errors","frameshifting","kasugamycin","stop codon","cultured cells","synthesis of pol gene products","experimental system","influence of structural","gag-pol junction of HIV","different mutated versions","external factors","target of high level slippage","base-pair deletions","readthough","unique cloning sites","retroviruses","antibiotics","rise","reporter","various organisms","bacteria","DNA fragment","active product","results","Mutations","sequence","addition"],"language":"en"},

Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K(i) = 4.0 nM). The simulations indicate that, after the cleavage of the ester, the carboxylic acid leaves the active site and re-binds to the enzyme in an orientation that allows the formation of a very stable \u03C0-complex between the catalytic dyad (Cys-25/His-162) of rhodesain and the electrophilic aromatic moiety. The reversible inhibition mode results because the S(N)Ar reaction, which is found in an alkaline solvent containing a low molecular weight thiol, is hindered within the enzyme due to the presence of the positively charged imidazolium ring of His-162. Comparisons between measured and calculated NMR shifts support this interpretation.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, Philipp; Johe, Patrick; Wagner, Annika; Jung, Sascha; K\u00FChlborn, Jonas; Barthels, Fabian; Tenzer, Stefan; Distler, Ute; Waigel, Waldemar; Engels, Bernd; Hellmich, Ute A.; Opatz, Till; Schirmeister, Tanja","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3de2d665c98144d8667e88e520575c751a5208c7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb317870f3ed36f9a5c3e87d76e0f6e4d821bfa0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7145299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enzyme kinetics","design of enzyme inhibitors","active site","active inhibitors of disease","potent inhibitor of rhodesain","arenes","weakly active prodrug inhibitor","liberated carboxylic acid","peptidic recognition sequence","trypanosomal protease rhodesain","electrophilic aromatic moiety","NMR spectroscopy","Ar addition","elimination reactions","ester function","Ar reaction","calculated NMR shifts","stable \u03C0-complex","unexpected mode of action","various types of simulations","reversible inhibition mode results","mass spectrometry","low molecular weight thiol","re-binds","alkaline solvent","catalytic dyad","Meisenheimer","complexes","Comparisons","products","relevant proteases","nucleophiles","Cys","formation","interpretation","presence","orientation","combination","cleavage","imidazolium ring","hydrolysis","building blocks"],"language":"en"},

We propose to use the difference between accurately predicted and observed retention times for each peptide as a metric to evaluate different quality control methods. To this end, we develop AutoRT, a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy in retention time prediction. Analysis of three cancer data sets with a total of 287 tumor samples using different quality control strategies results in substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides and putative neoantigens. Our systematic evaluation, using the proposed retention time metric, provides insights and practical guidance on the selection of quality control strategies. We implement the recommended strategy in a computational workflow named NeoFlow to support proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization, enabling more sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Bo; Li, Kai; Zhang, Yun; Zhang, Bing","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6726c162b4f4584114ad508ebfb14a3726ff2837.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7145864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145864/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different quality control strategies results","performance of different quality control methods","selection of quality control strategies","different numbers","proposed retention time metric","retention time prediction","retention times","proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization","Genomics-based neoantigen discovery","sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens","variant peptide identification","variant peptides","high accuracy","insights","tumor samples","deep learning algorithm","total","NeoFlow","practical guidance","computational workflow","cancer data sets","AutoRT","recommended strategy","lack of consensus","systematic evaluation","Analysis","proteomic evidence","difference"],"language":"en"},

We have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding RVFV glycoproteins (rMVAGnGc) was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal RVFV challenge. Protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific CD8\u002B cells, with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies. In this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after MVA vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy. Thus, we tested the efficacy and immune responses in BALB/c mice of recombinant MVA viruses expressing either glycoprotein Gn (rMVAGn) or Gc (rMVAGc). In the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies, our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the RVFV challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against Gc epitopes. The involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rMVA based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against Gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn immune serum. Thus, Gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in BALB/c mice, contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Gil, Elena; Moreno, Sandra; Ortego, Javier; Borrego, Bel\u00E9n; Lorenzo, Gema; Brun, Alejandro","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c982fd0a6ca458268cea2b31cc6e01ab82c10de4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157666/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protection of mice","protection of vaccinated mice","suboptimal humoral immune responses","protective immune response","rMVAGn immune serum","virus challenge","lethal RVFV challenge","neutralizing antibodies","activation of cellular responses","c mice of recombinant MVA viruses","MVA vaccination","glycoprotein Gn","glycoprotein antigen","RVFV glycoproteins","Gc-specific cellular immunity","role of humoral responses","subneutralizing antibody immune response","Gn antigen","BALB","presence of rMVAGnGc","presence of glycoprotein specific CD8","involvement of cellular immunity","Gc epitopes","protective efficacy","data","single dose vaccination","absence of serum","single inoculation of sucrose","elimination of infected cells","Rift Valley fever virus","deleterious effect","modified vaccinia Ankara","disease","morbidity","mortality","important component","low-level detection of","infection","contribution","fact","observations","rMVAGc","work"],"language":"en"},

Vitamin E, a lipid\u2010soluble antioxidant vitamin, is important for normal function of the immune cells. The elderly are at a greater risk for vitamin E intake that is lower than recommended levels. Vitamin E supplementation above currently recommended levels has been shown to improve immune functions in the aged including delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity skin response and antibody production in response to vaccination, which was shown to be mediated through increased production of interleukin (IL)\u20102, leading to enhanced proliferation of T cells, and through reduced production of prostaglandin E(2), a T\u2010cell suppressive factor, as a result of a decreased peroxynitrite formation.

In future, increases in the number of ICU beds relative to bed numbers in other hospital wards will probably be contemplated, even in a scenario of decreasing costs; clinical protocols will be computerized and/or nurse-driven; more multicenter and international trials will be performed; and organizational strategies will concentrate ICU personnel in a few large units, to promote the flexible management of these healthcare workers. Moreover, extracorporeal organ support technologies will be improved; technology informatics will cover all the bureaucratic aspects of healthcare work, aiding the staff in workload assessment; and critical care multidisciplinary rounds and follow-up services for post-ICU patients will be implemented. Lastly, a better continuum of care between the pre-hospital phase, the emergency care phase, the ICU phase, and the post-ICU phase should be achieved. Also, policies should be drafted to manage sudden large demands for critical care beds in mega-emergencies.

In regions with high adversity of infectious diseases, human cultures are characterized by high collectivism, whereas in regions of low parasite stress cultures are highly individualistic. The prediction from the parasite-stress theory of values that infectious disease transmissible among humans (nonzoonotics) will be more important in predicting collectivism\u2013individualism than those that humans can contract only from nonhuman animals (zoonotics) was supported. Evidence in human movement patterns for nations, states of the USA, and indigenous societies supports the hypothesis that the absence of dispersal (high philopatry) is a defense against contact with novel parasites in out-groups and their habitats. We show that human cultures with high degrees of collectivism have high degrees of cooperative breeding, and propose that the parasite-stress theory of sociality offers a general theory of family structure across humans as well as nonhuman animal taxa. We propose that a major context for the evolution of human reciprocity was in gaining benefits from out-group interactions during periods of relatively low disease threat. The parasite-stress theory of values offers a novel perspective to explain the evolution of reciprocity and human unique cognitive abilities.

Overall, 25\u201350% of pediatric HSCT patients will develop pulmonary complications. Thus, prevention, early detection, and intervention are key to minimizing the sequelae from HSCT-associated pulmonary complications. HSCT-associated pulmonary complications can be classified as infectious or noninfectious, and they often follow a predictable timeline, occurring during discrete phases of HSCT (pre-engraftment, early post-engraftment, late post-engraftment). However, certain post-HSCT pulmonary complications span the entire post-HSCT course. The most common causes of noninfectious pulmonary complications are related to the conditioning regimen used which can result in varying degrees of acute or delayed lung injury, the degree of recipient\u2013donor HLA histoincompatibility, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source, the degree of graft manipulation, and the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), both acute and chronic. Infectious etiologies can be caused by any class of pathogen including bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan. They usually occur during periods of profound and/or prolonged neutropenia and/or impaired or delayed cellular and humoral immune recovery. Immunosuppression used to prevent or treat GvHD also places a HSCT recipient at high risk for developing pulmonary infections that can be life-threatening. This chapter discusses the most common pulmonary complications associated with HSCT by time period post-HSCT.","publish_time":"2017-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapadia, Malika; Shapiro, Terry Wikle","journal":"Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for the Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b15a8201eecaedb2e6ee9ea78193b8e46c2d42e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123319.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allogeneic HSCT","HSCT recipient","certain post-HSCT pulmonary complications","common pulmonary complications","pediatric HSCT patients","entire post-HSCT course","time period post-HSCT","pulmonary infections","discrete phases of HSCT","common causes of noninfectious pulmonary complications","early post-engraftment","late post-engraftment","pre-engraftment","degree of recipient","GvHD","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","degree of graft manipulation","early detection","development of graft","Infectious etiologies","delayed lung injury","varying degrees of acute","source","donor HLA histoincompatibility","intervention","leading cause of morbidity","high risk","sequelae","humoral immune recovery","years","class of pathogen","prolonged neutropenia","host disease","predictable timeline","mortality","prevention","outcomes","conditioning regimen","chapter","periods of profound","protozoan","Immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

Especially surfaces close to the patients\u2019 environment may be touched at high frequencies, allowing transmission from animated sources to others via contaminated inanimate surfaces. Therefore, the knowledge on the survival of bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa on surfaces, and hence, in a broader sense, in the human environment, is important for implementing tactics for prevention of Healthcare-acquired Infections (HAI). This chapter will elaborate the role of surfaces in the transmission of pathogens. Particular emphasis is laid on the current knowledge of the survival time and conditions favouring survival of the pathogens. Finally, mechanisms of transmission from inanimate surfaces to patients are highlighted. Within the multi-barrier strategy of the prevention of HAI, environmental disinfection policies should be based on risk assessments for surfaces with different risks for cross contamination such as high- and low-touched surfaces with appropriate standards for adequate disinfection measures under consideration of the persistence and infectious dose of the pathogens. As a result, surface disinfection is indicated in the following situations: Frequently touched surfaces adjacent to patients. Surfaces with assumed or visible contamination. Terminal disinfection in rooms or areas where infected or colonized patients with easily transferable nosocomial pathogens are cared for, and in outbreak situations. Furthermore, the knowledge of the persistence of pathogens will also support ensuring the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories, food-handling settings, and for hygienic behaviour in the everyday life to prevent transmission of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2014-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kramer, Axel; Assadian, Ojan","journal":"Use of Biocidal Surfaces for Reduction of Healthcare Acquired Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dc911a926a1167ff2ccee52953fdf41cb01a3f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare-acquired Infections"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of surfaces","transmission of pathogens","contaminated inanimate surfaces","touched surfaces adjacent","persistence of pathogens","healthcare settings microbial contaminated surfaces","mechanisms of transmission","transmission of infectious diseases","surface disinfection","Terminal disinfection","indirect transmission of infection","transferable nosocomial pathogens","important role","adequate disinfection measures","environmental disinfection policies","prevention of HAI","prevention of Healthcare","colonized patients","survival of bacteria","survival time","current knowledge","high frequencies","cross contamination","human environment","patients\u2019 environment","infectious dose","visible contamination","following situations","outbreak situations","food-handling settings","consideration","different risks","appropriate standards","biomedical laboratories","areas","animated sources","everyday life","risk assessments","hygienic behaviour","rooms","fungi","viruses","conditions","biosafety","protozoa","tactics","multi-barrier strategy","broader sense","Infections","Particular emphasis","result","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In the general population, the incidence and mortality associated with ARDS over the last two decades have steadily declined in parallel with optimized approaches to pneumonia and other underlying causes of ARDS as well as increased utilization of multimodal treatment strategies that include lung-protective ventilation. In the cancer settings, significant declines in the incidence and mortality of ARDS over the past two decades have also been reported, although these rates remain significantly higher than those in the general population. Epidemiologic studies identify infection, including disseminated fungal pneumonias, as a major underlying cause of ARDS in the cancer setting. More than half of cancer patients who develop ARDS will not survive to hospital discharge. Those who do survive often face a protracted and often incomplete recovery, resulting in significant long-term physical, psychological, and cognitive sequelae. The residual organ dysfunction and poor functional status after ARDS may delay or preclude subsequent cancer treatments. As such, close collaboration between the critical care physicians and oncology team is essential in identifying and reversing the underlying causes and optimizing treatments for cancer patients with ARDS. This chapter reviews the diagnosis and common causes of ARDS in cancer and gives an update on the general management principles for cancer patients with ARDS in the ICU.","publish_time":"2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, Alisha Y.; Shannon, Vickie R.","journal":"Oncologic Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40587edcf5303a1a18aa4ea19784c65b8644ebf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality of ARDS","underlying causes of ARDS","common causes of ARDS","cancer settings","major underlying cause of ARDS","half of cancer patients","subsequent cancer treatments","general population","incidence","decades","general management principles","significant declines","diffuse lung injury","significant long-term physical","heterogeneous form of acute","lung-protective ventilation","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","increased utilization of multimodal treatment strategies","critical care physicians","alveolar-capillary interface permeability","disseminated fungal pneumonias","poor functional status","residual organ dysfunction","non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema","infection","oncology team","dysregulated inflammation","update","incomplete recovery","optimized approaches","close collaboration","diagnosis","Epidemiologic studies","cognitive sequelae","chapter","ICU","hospital discharge","rates"],"language":"en"},

Defined as cells equipped with diverse pattern recognition molecules capable of detecting MAMPs and DAMPs, they encompass cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. Located at the body surfaces, epithelial cells represent the first line of innate immune defense against invading microbial pathogens. They are significant contributors to innate mucosal immunity and generate various antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Also, epithelial cells critically contribute to tissue repair via the phenomenon of re-epithelialization. Fibroblasts operate as classical sentinel cells of the innate immune system dedicated to responding to MAMPs and DAMPs emitted upon any tissue injury. Typically, fibroblasts synthesize most of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, thereby playing a crucial role in tissue repair processes. Vascular cells of the innate immune system represent an evolutionarily developed first-line defense against any inciting insult hitting the vessel walls from the luminal side including bacteria, viruses, microbial toxins, and chemical noxa such as nicotine. Upon such insults and following recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs, vascular cells react with an innate immune response to create an acute inflammatory milieu in the vessel wall aimed at curing the vascular injury concerned. Chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts represent other vital cells of the skeletal system acting as cells of the innate immune system in its wider sense. These cells mediate injury-promoted DAMP-induced inflammatory and regenerative processes specific for the skeletal systems. Finally, adipocytes are regarded as highly active cells of the innate immune system. As white, brown, and beige adipocytes, they operate as a dynamic metabolic organ that can secrete certain bioactive molecules which have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions.","publish_time":"2018-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Land, Walter Gottlieb","journal":"Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0a67559ec7b7ae4c99839059634b5e0754e50f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vascular cells","epithelial cells","vital cells","sessile cells","active cells","innate immune system","classical sentinel cells","innate immune response","line of innate immune defense","vascular injury","fibroblasts","DAMPs","tissue injury","recognition of MAMPs","line defense","tissue repair processes","osteoblasts","chondrocytes","beige adipocytes","vessel walls","microbial toxins","various antimicrobial defense mechanisms","microbial pathogens","skeletal systems","diverse pattern recognition molecules capable","certain bioactive molecules","acute inflammatory milieu","regenerative processes specific","mucosal immunity","endocrine","crucial role","viruses","bacteria","inciting insult","chemical noxa","dynamic metabolic organ","extracellular matrix of connective tissues","osteoclasts","wider sense","phenomenon of re-epithelialization","autocrine actions","significant contributors","brown","body surfaces","chapter","nicotine","insults"],"language":"en"},

Environmental health has emerged as an important part of medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 24% of global disease burden and 23% of all deaths can be attributed to environmental factors. Deaths from heart disease, cancer, respiratory disorders and many vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and cholera have increased due to changes in climate, especially in developing countries. Besides limited attention to sanitation, hygiene, as well as quality of food and drinking water, factors such as deforestation, increasing vehicular traffic, migration from rural to urban areas, decreasing water resources and inadequate drainage systems contribute to increase incidence of diseases. The need of the hour is to sensitize ourselves about the way our ecology is being degraded and the health effects it is causing. A holistic view is needed to address the problem of environmental health where agriculture, animal husbandry, public health, water safety and air pollution need to be looked at in a combined manner for education, planning and resource allocation.

Depending upon the intensity of transmission and severity of disease, pandemic influenza may cause as many as 350 million deaths and result in economic losses topping $1 trillion \u2013 an impact great enough to create a worldwide recession. We then reviewed 100 papers primarily from more than a dozen countries which studied the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children, adults, and the elderly. These studies demonstrate that influenza vaccination is quite cost-effective among children 6 months to 18 years old, in health care workers and pregnant women, and in high-risk individuals. Remarkably, compared with the other recently introduced vaccines for children, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal polysaccharide, vaccinating children and school attendees results in societal cost savings because it obviates lost productivity and wages among infected individuals and their caretakers. Vaccination for children is recommended in the USA and in Canada, but public health policy makers in Europe have undervalued this vaccine and not recommended it so widely.","publish_time":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Julia A.; Maher, Cyrus","journal":"Influenza Vaccines for the Future","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54bdbca58345fa738a36332d3df23ebbdf7b93e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["France","Europe"],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","influenza vaccination","cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine","vaccinating children","Seasonal influenza costs Germany","current economic estimates of influenza","economic costs of human seasonal","economic losses","USA","vaccines","infected individuals","high-risk individuals","health care workers","public health policy makers","school attendees results","societal cost savings","lost productivity","pregnant women","years old","pneumococcal polysaccharide","rotavirus","wages","Canada","Europe","severity of disease","France","months","adults","intensity of transmission","published assessments","impact great","caretakers","deaths","dozen countries","worldwide recession","elderly","studies","objective","chapter","papers"],"language":"en"},

HSA is a monomeric multidomain macromolecule, representing the main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure and the main modulator of fluid distribution between body compartments. HSA displays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA is the most important antioxidant capacity of human plasma, in addition to its ability to protect the body from the harmful effects of heavy metals such as iron and copper and reduce their ability to produce reactive oxygen radicals. HSA is the main depot for nitric oxide (NO) transport in the blood. HSA represents the main carrier for fatty acids, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, and provides the metabolic modification of some drugs and displays pseudo-enzymatic properties. HSA has been widely used successfully for more than 50 years in many settings of perioperative medicine including hypovolemia, shock, burns, surgical blood loss, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the use of HSA has shown a promising neuroprotective effect in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most recent evidence-based functions and uses of HSA in the perioperative period are reviewed in this chapter.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farag, Ehab; Ebrahim, Zeyd Y.","journal":"Perioperative Fluid Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b847d808761705ef2550dc3bb6edeffe67da8731.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of HSA","main carrier","main depot","main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure","drugs","ability","main modulator of fluid distribution","abundant plasma proteins","important antioxidant capacity of human plasma","body compartments","perioperative period","surgical blood loss","settings of perioperative medicine","Human serum albumin","sepsis","shock","promising neuroprotective effect","acute respiratory distress syndrome","patients","harmful effects of heavy metals","iron","hypovolemia","fatty acids","predominant product of hepatic protein synthesis","subarachnoid hemorrhage","monomeric multidomain macromolecule","nitric oxide","integrity","ARDS","copper","pharmacokinetics","addition","recent evidence-based functions","metabolic modification","pseudo-enzymatic properties","reactive oxygen radicals","transport","years","essential role","vascular barrier","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In addition, in some jurisdictions, medical practitioners have associated statutory obligations and powers, related to the examination of a patient directed for assessment by the public health authority, the furnishing of reports of such examinations, the role of the practitioner in ordering a patient into isolation, and responsibilities of medical practitioners in public health emergencies.

Viruses must continuously adapt to the conditions of their host or their host populations, so selection mechanisms are accessible to experimental approaches. In this context, different criteria play an important role, such as the antigenic diversity, the extent of virus excretion, and the degree of virulence. The complete adaptation of a virus to its host, which leads to a minimization of virulence of the infectious agent, is for both parties the desirable consequence: i.e. a problem-free coexistence and survival. For example, hepatitis G virus (GB virus C) which was initially isolated from patients with liver inflammation, seems to persist in many people without causing illnesses. A similar situation is observed with torque teno viruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). Spumaviruses are also found in many animal species and humans without causing symptomatic infections (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). For many viruses, the maximum exploitation of genetic variability is not always useful. Viruses reach a limit at which a greater variance is no longer advantageous: the proportion of non-infectious virus variants among the progeny becomes too high, whereby the potentially possible error limit is reached.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0c7ae6a86739294e2a19a38c4eb5a0654c06d2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123911.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123911/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatitis G virus","GB virus C","extent of virus excretion","torque teno viruses","proportion of non-infectious virus variants","host populations","minimization of virulence","degree of virulence","high numbers of offspring","possible error limit","short generation time","evolutionary processes","selection mechanisms","important role","antigenic diversity","maximum exploitation of genetic variability","animal species","problem-free coexistence","humans","parties","different criteria","experimental approaches","infectious agent","ideal objects","example","progeny","symptomatic infections","desirable consequence","similar situation","patients","liver inflammation","survival","context","greater variance","conditions","complete adaptation","simple structure","people","illnesses","Spumaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Hypoventilation due to pain and insufficient cough is the reason for postoperative pneumonia after thoracic surgery. There is a risk index developed from preoperative patients and operation-specific risk factors. The risk index may be useful for high-risk patients; therefore giving these patient groups more attention in the perioperative period and taking preventive measures may reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Postoperative period composed of pulmonary rehabilitation and analgesia includes breathing exercise, cough training, self-management education, and psychosocial support, and they have been shown to decrease complications. According to some new studies, paravertebral block has similar analgesic effects with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). Although paravertebral block has fewer adverse effects, TEA is still the gold standard for pain relief after thoracotomies.

The culprit was determined to be a coronavirus of animal origin [SARS-CoV]. The discovery of the SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of \u003E8000 people in \u003E30 countries with fatality of about 10%, resulted in intense search for novel coronaviruses with potentially high pathogenicity. Ten years later after the SARS pandemic, another novel coronavirus crossed the species barrier from bats to humans through an intermediate camel host, to produce a severe lower respiratory infection labeled the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]. A novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV] was first identified in September 2012, from patients who resided or traveled to Saudi Arabia. The MERS-CoV spread through contacts with camel and subsequently from human to human via droplet transmission. MERS cases occurred in several other countries including in Europe and the United States, mainly from residence or travel to the Arabian Peninsula, but was not of pandemic potential. However, in the spring of 2015, a MERS outbreak started in South Korea which was initiated by a returning traveler from Saudi Arabia, and subsequently secondary infection of over 186 local residents occurred. Recent estimate in May 2015 indicates that the MERS-CoV have afflicted 1167 patients with MERS worldwide with 479 deaths [41% fatality]. Thus MERS is more deadly than SARS but appears to be less contagious. However, unlike SARS which has not reappeared since 2002\u20132003, MERS-CoV have the potential to cause sporadic or local outbreaks for many years as the virus may now be entrenched endemically in dromedary camels of the Middle East.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong, I.

Its incidence has substantially increased over the past decades and overall mortality has declined during this period of time. It was reported that sepsis incidence increased from 82.7 to 240.4 per 100,000 population between 1979\u20132000. At the same time, sepsis global mortality decreased from 27.8 to 17.9% [1\u20133]. However, the absolute number of deaths significantly increased from 21.9 to 43.9 per 100,000 population. Male gender, some chronic diseases like diabetes, immunosuppressive states, human immunodeficiency virus infections, and malignancies are factors that increase the risk for sepsis. Some particular conditions like progressive number of organ dysfunctions, in-hospital-acquired infections and increasing age are associated with higher risk of death [1,4]. On the other hand, septic shock mortality only diminished from 61.6 to 53.1% [5]. This slight decline in mortality observed during recent decades could be attributable to improvements in supportive care and/or avoidance of iatrogenic complications. For example, the instrumentation of early goal resuscitation protocols not aiming at supranormal targets for cardiac output and oxygen delivery, and the use of lung protective strategies could explain at least in part this favorable change. Other strategies directed to treat the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the septic process like recombinant human-activated protein-C (rhAPC), have also contributed to improve survival. However, mortality remains unacceptably high and further improvement in sepsis management is needed.","publish_time":"2009-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurtado, F.

Initial studies focused on the use of the chemokine ligands, or altered derivatives, of CXCR4 and CCR5 to prevent the entrance of HIV-1 into immune cells (Schols 2006). While these studies showed some initial promise, there was evidence of significant caveats to their use, including selection of alternative coreceptor utilizing strains (Marechal et al. 1999; Mosier et al. 1999) and the potential to cause inflammatory side effects. These data prompted the development and study of small molecule inhibitors of CXCR4 and CCR5, which have also been used to examine the roles of these molecules in a variety of inflammatory and infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2009-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, Robyn S.; McCandless, Erin E.","journal":"Chemokine Receptors and NeuroAIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0cb6be65543aa28485b22aae2886f423327a896.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Feng","Deng"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCR5","entrance of HIV","use","increasing resistance of HIV","chemokine receptors CXCR4","molecules","Initial studies","development of alternative therapeutics","variety of inflammatory","chemokine ligands","initial promise","study of small molecule inhibitors of CXCR4","selection of alternative coreceptor","strains","altered derivatives","evidence of significant caveats","Marechal","coreceptors","discovery","Bleul","time","immune cells","Mosier","potential","infectious diseases","emphasis","Deng","leukocytes","antiretroviral therapies","entry","infected individuals","Nagasawa","Feng","Schols","effects","roles","data","Oberlin","Alkhatib","Dragic","years"],"language":"en"},

The identification of many novel peptidases from genome sequencing programmes has suggested potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several well characterised peptidases were recently shown to possess new and unexpected biological roles in neuroinflammation, cancer and angiogenesis, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegeneration. This chapter will briefly characterize the main classes of metallopeptidases and their roles in health and disease. Particular attention will be paid to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neprilysin (NEP) and adamalysin (ADAM) families of proteases and their pathophysiological roles with a particular emphasis on cancer and neurodegeneration. The roles and mechanisms of protein shedding which primarily involve the ADAMs family of metallopeptidases will be explained using amyloid protein precursor (APP) processing cascades as a well characterized example.

Of all high frequency ventilation techniques, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is the most well studied and is the most commonly utilized in clinical practice today. In HFOV, small volume oscillatory vibrations are superimposed on continuous distending pressure in a manner that allows efficient CO(2) elimination during continuous alveolar recruitment. By preserving end-expiratory lung volume, minimizing cyclic stretch, and avoiding alveolar overdistension at end-inspiration, HFOV is uniquely capable of providing the ultimate \u201Copen lung\u201D strategy of ventilation. Over the past decade, a growing evidence base implicating phasic alveolar stretch in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung injury in patients with respiratory failure has driven the iterative refinement of HFOV management protocols for infants, children, and adults. The next step toward applying HFOV in a manner that takes into account the heterogeneity of parenchymal involvement in diseases such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome will require the development of non-invasive bedside technologies capable of identifying regional changes in lung volume and lung mechanics. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising technique that could play a supporting role in the conduct of future clinical trials seeking to identify HFOV strategies that are maximally lung protective.","publish_time":"2014-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ventre, Kathleen M.; Arnold, John H.","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ad4f1fde755925c3684f892ee965442dfdf7684.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","HFOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["open lung","lung mechanics","lung protective","HFOV strategies","end-expiratory lung volume","high frequency oscillatory ventilation","chronic lung injury","high frequency ventilation techniques","reliable ventilation","strategy of ventilation","alveolar overdistension","iterative refinement of HFOV management protocols","continuous alveolar recruitment","high frequencies","manner","small volume oscillatory vibrations","pathogenesis of acute","cyclic stretch","respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","end-inspiration","clinical practice","growing evidence base implicating phasic alveolar stretch","continuous distending pressure","conduct of future clinical trials","development of non-invasive bedside technologies capable","regional changes","diseases","infants","patients","supporting role","physiologic dead space","children","heterogeneity of parenchymal involvement","past decade","promising technique","account","elimination","tidal volumes","Electrical impedance tomography","investigators","adults","step","years"],"language":"en"},

The essence of this technology is a sequential solution (with the use of the information obtained on the previous steps) of the QSAR paradigm by a series of enhanced models based on molecular structure description (in a specific order from 1D to 4D). Actually, it\u2019s a system of permanently improved solutions. Different approaches for domain applicability estimation are implemented in HiT QSAR. In the SiRMS approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality, and symmetry). The level of simplex descriptors detailed increases consecutively from the 1D to 4D representation of the molecular structure. The advantages of the approach presented are an ability to solve QSAR/QSPR tasks for mixtures of compounds, the absence of the \u201Cmolecular alignment\u201D problem, consideration of different physical\u2013chemical properties of atoms (e.g., charge, lipophilicity), and the high adequacy and good interpretability of obtained models and clear ways for molecular design. The efficiency of HiT QSAR was demonstrated by its comparison with the most popular modern QSAR approaches on two representative examination sets. The examples of successful application of the HiT QSAR for various QSAR/QSPR investigations on the different levels (1D\u20134D) of the molecular structure description are also highlighted. The reliability of developed QSAR models as the predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic, biological, etc. experiments. The HiT QSAR is realized as the suite of computer programs termed the \u201CHiT QSAR\u201D software that so includes powerful statistical capabilities and a number of useful utilities.","publish_time":"2009-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuz\u2019min, Victor E.; Artemenko, A.G.; Muratov, Eugene N.; Polischuk, P.G.; Ognichenko, L.N.; Liahovsky, A.V.; Hromov, A.I.; Varlamova, E.V.","journal":"Recent Advances in QSAR Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98e910dd909a432e0e0684625f5a7f4178cea8b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QSAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different QSAR","QSAR paradigm","various QSAR","efficiency of HiT QSAR","hierarchical QSAR technology","reliability of developed QSAR models","molecular structure description","popular modern QSAR approaches","molecular design","D representation","simplex representation of molecular structure","Different approaches","molecular alignment","different levels","system of different simplexes","QSPR tasks","consideration of different physical","QSPR investigations","SiRMS","good interpretability of obtained models","series of enhanced models","examples of successful application","basis of directed drug design","level of simplex descriptors detailed increases","tetratomic fragments","fixed composition","clear ways","predictive virtual screening tools","chemical properties of atoms","subsequent synthetic","high adequacy","domain applicability estimation","powerful statistical capabilities","representative examination sets","problem","specific order","comparison","mixtures of compounds","number of useful utilities","lipophilicity","chirality","absence","previous steps","software","sequential solution","suite of computer programs","information","experiments","charge","improved solutions","essence","molecule","symmetry","chapter","advantages"],"language":"en"},

Immunosenescence plays an important role in not only rendering these seniors susceptible in infection, particularly viral respiratory infection, but also interferes with protection.

This chapter is a succinct review of recent studies in this field.","publish_time":"2018-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelleg, Amir; Polosa, Riccardo","journal":"The Adenosine Receptors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/337fb579e2509cb0a3b1badbacf169d44746737f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Extracellular Ado acts","source of extracellular Ado","rapid degradation of extracellular adenosine","pulmonary mast cells","important role","numerous studies","various pulmonary pathologies","succinct review of recent studies","ubiquitous adenine nucleoside adenosine","immune-mediated histamine release","activation of G protein","paracrine agent","Ado\u2019s signal transductions","cell surface receptors","asthma","COPD","cellular energetics","triphosphate","chapter","GPCRs","pathophysiologic conditions","ATP","field","ectoenzymes","data","decades"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we present a detailed analysis of four key episodes of the scientific inquiries during the SARS epidemic, namely, (1) the identification of the transmission mode, (2) the hunt for the causative agent of SARS, (3) the search for the natural host of the SARS-related coronavirus, and (4) the explanation of the mysterious infection pattern in the tragic outbreak at Amoy Gardens (a residential complex), to highlight the important roles and characteristics of models, modeling, and multiple levels of representations of science. We also describe how these scientific models developed were intricately related to social, cultural, and political environments.

Of these the most important are (1) maintaining pH through regulation of acid/base levels and (2) excreting end products of metabolism. As for most organ-systems, these functions are especially important for healing following trauma and/or surgery and decline with age. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is one of the common forms of organ failures seen in the ICU and elderly patients are more prone to it. The causes maybe classified as Prerenal (inadequate perfusion), renal (inherent kidney disease) and post-renal (urinary obstruction). Preventing AKI should be an important concern in all critically ill patients but especially important in the elderly patients since the development of AKI can significantly increase in-hospital mortality. Once AKI has set in a systematic and step-wise approach of diagnosis and management is key to avoiding adverse outcomes.","publish_time":"2017-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malhotra, Ajai","journal":"Geriatric Trauma and Acute Care Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aa702e5b54381c2c72c4efe97f6dfa8c1c25471.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elderly patients","important concern","development of AKI","ill patients","organ-systems","inherent kidney disease","multitude of essential functions","Acute Kidney Injury","common forms of organ failures","management","step-wise approach of diagnosis","inadequate perfusion","ICU","base levels","regulation of acid","pH","healing","human body","urinary obstruction","surgery","adverse outcomes","Kidneys","trauma","end products of metabolism","causes","hospital mortality"],"language":"en"},

The analysis is based primarily on children\u2019s drawings, interviews with children and observations on them, and literature review. The subjects of this study were 16 children from incomplete families, who participated in weekly drawing activities. In addition to the drawings by the children, data in the form of verbal descriptions and non-verbal expressions were collected throughout the drawing sessions via notes-taking, audio-taping, and photo-taking. The data were analysed to provide an understanding of the children\u2019s definitions of the family, the functions of the family, the roles of the parents, what constitutes a \u201Cfamily member\u201D in the minds of the children, the relationships and affection among family members, and the children\u2019s expectations of the family. With such an analysis, it is hoped to explore the children\u2019s perception of their family life, their feelings and emotions, and their outlook for the future. The children had many expectations and hopes concerning their family, home, family members including themselves, and society at large. They also had many dissatisfactions, even complaints. While the children had not discussed much about the functions of the family, they placed much importance on its emotional aspects, and they had expressed emotional needs for parents. In the eyes of the children from incomplete families, \u201CChildren\u2019s Home\u201D is a place that satisfies their daily living needs, but it is not family as it lacks affection. In sum, by letting the children speak their minds through their own drawings and interpretations, this study provides a fresh perspective from children on their views of family, family members, as well as the reality and fantasy of life.","publish_time":"2012-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Man-ching, Ada Lee","journal":"International Handbook of Chinese Families","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98eaa75ba4ac81c8189c3fc5edc67e0580e52790.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["family members","family life","views of family","opinions of children","children\u2019s drawings","Children\u2019s Home","children\u2019s expectations","children\u2019s definitions","study","children\u2019s perception","incomplete families","minds","data","emotional needs","parents","functions","affection","analysis","drawing sessions","fantasy of life","emotional aspects","weekly drawing activities","daily living needs","non-verbal expressions","form of verbal descriptions","place","observations","relationships","fresh perspective","notes","feelings","emotions","interpretations","interviews","audio-taping","outlook","reality","understanding","importance","perceptions","eyes","roles","photo","literature review","subjects","addition","society","dissatisfactions","complaints","future","sum"],"language":"en"},

Initial neuroimaging has to rule out infectious foci of the skull base such as purulent sinusitis or mastoiditis. In patients with focal deficits or seizures, MRI is the tool of choice to diagnose vascular or septic complications. Neoplastic, viral, or fungal infections of the CNS may present with similar changes of the meninges; however, fungal meningitis normally causes a thicker and more nodular enhancement. In case of basal accentuation of the leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and conspicuous signal changes in the basal cisterns, one has to consider tuberculous meningitis for differential diagnosis, especially in patients with HIV infection.

It acts to keep alveoli from collapsing during the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. After its secretion, lung surfactant forms a lattice structure on the alveolar surface, known as tubular myelin. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A, B, C and D make up to 10% of the total surfactant. SP-B and SPC are relatively small hydrophobic proteins, and are involved in the reduction of surface-tension at the air-liquid interface. SP-A and SP-D, on the other hand, are large oligomeric, hydrophilic proteins that belong to the collagenous Ca(2\u002B)-dependent C-type lectin family (known as \u201CCollectins\u201D), and play an important role in host defense and in the recycling and transport of lung surfactant (Awasthi 2010) (Fig. 43.1). In particular, there is increasing evidence that surfactant-associated proteins A and -D (SP-A and SP-D, respectively) contribute to the host defense against inhaled microorganisms (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_24 and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_25). Based on their ability to recognize pathogens and to regulate the host defense, SP-A and SP-D have been recently categorized as \u201CSecretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors\u201D. While SP-A and SP-D were first identified in the lung; the expression of these proteins has also been observed at other mucosal surfaces, such as lacrimal glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, genitourinary epithelium and periodontal surfaces. SP-A is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. This chapter gives an overview on the understanding of role of SP-A and SP-D in for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research to further elucidate the role of these molecules in adult lung diseases. As an outlook, it will become an issue of pulmonary pathology which might provide promising perspectives for applications in research, diagnosis and therapy (Awasthi 2010).","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Anita","journal":"Animal Lectins: Form, Function and Clinical Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9709452f6906f212ef90d83e77f32c46c9dd5a84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Clara"],"organizations":["SPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SP-D","SP-B","expression of SP","Surfactant proteins","surfactant-associated proteins","pulmonary host defense","pulmonary surfactant-system","hydrophilic proteins","transport of lung surfactant","total surfactant","small hydrophobic proteins","issue of pulmonary pathology","human pulmonary disorders","pulmonary cytokine-network","alveolar type","alveolar surface","understanding of role","important role","adult lung diseases","Awasthi","pathology-orientated research","epithelial cells","periodontal surfaces","mucosal surfaces","reduction of surface","dependent C-type lectin family","bronchiolar Clara cells","gastrointestinal mucosa","lacrimal glands","genitourinary epithelium","promising perspectives","lattice structure","tension","applications","diagnosis","importance","SPC","recycling","complex mixture of lipids","major player","expiratory phase","therapy","hand","molecules","evidence","air-liquid interface","Secretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors","respiratory cycle","overview","tubular myelin","collagenous Ca","pathogens","inhaled microorganisms","secretion","chromosomal level","alveoli","chapter","Collectins","outlook","ability"],"language":"en"},

Some saponins are also important pharmaceuticals, and the underexplored biodiversity of plant saponins is likely to prove to be a vital resource for future drug discovery. The biological activity of saponins is normally attributed to the amphipathic properties of these molecules, which consist of a hydrophobic triterpene or sterol backbone and a hydrophilic carbohydrate chain, although some saponins are known to have potent biological activities that are dependent on other aspects of their structure. This chapter will focus on the biological activity and the synthesis of some of the best-studied examples of plant saponins and on recent developments in the identification of the genes and enzymes responsible for saponin synthesis.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mugford, Sam T.; Osbourn, Anne","journal":"Isoprenoid Synthesis in Plants and Microorganisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd67a3630a2612b0a7adee9e4000c0314a4f37dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["examples of plant saponins","biological activity of saponins","underexplored biodiversity of plant saponins","plant defence","potent biological activities","diverse groups of plant natural products","saponin synthesis","sterol backbone","genes","disease","allelopathic agents","hydrophilic carbohydrate chain","identification","enzymes responsible","herbivores","recent developments","range of ecological roles","vital resource","future drug discovery","competitive interactions","plants","hydrophobic triterpene","important pharmaceuticals","best","molecules","aspects","amphipathic properties","structure","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Adequate resuscitation of blast-injured patients is critical, as both under- and over-resuscitation can result in a number of fatal complications. Consideration must be given to the choice of resuscitative fluid, the volume of resuscitation, the timing of resuscitation relative to definitive surgical management, and the determination of endpoints at which resuscitation can be stopped. This chapter explores resuscitation of blast-injured patients, beginning in the prehospital phase with initial choice of fluid and continuing through definitive resuscitation at a higher echelon of care. Particular consideration is given to the effect of resuscitation on the unique physiologic derangements seen following blast injury. Drawing upon the enormous amount of literature on resuscitation from the recent coalition experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, we advocate for the use of early hemostatic resuscitation with a high ratio of plasma, platelets, and packed red blood cells, with a transition to resuscitation guided by viscoelastic testing or coagulation status immediately following definitive control of hemorrhage.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kemp Bohan, Phillip; Schreiber, Martin A.","journal":"Managing Dismounted Complex Blast Injuries in Military \u0026 Civilian Settings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4f656c5235f4553079e1f3097a29eaf96529808.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iraq"],"keyphrases":["definitive resuscitation","effect of resuscitation","volume of resuscitation","over-resuscitation","Adequate resuscitation of blast","timing of resuscitation relative","use of early hemostatic resuscitation","following blast injury","Blast injuries","injured patients","definitive surgical management","definitive control of hemorrhage","initial choice of fluid","choice of resuscitative fluid","Particular consideration","complex patterns of injury","platelets","unique physiologic derangements","transition","high ratio of plasma","coagulation status","recent coalition experiences","packed red blood cells","viscoelastic testing","prehospital phase","Afghanistan","Iraq","literature","determination of endpoints","higher echelon of care","chapter","number of fatal complications","hemorrhagic shock"],"language":"en"},

T lymphocytes first identified in the chordate lineage and constitute a highly sophisticated branch of adaptive immune system. Apart from B cells, it is the only cell type that exhibits antigenic specificities; achieved by gene rearrangement. T cells are unique with respect to diversity of their subsets, which have distinct effector specificities, proliferative abilities, memory generation, and life span. T cells are impactful in viral infections by virtue of their capability to combat intracellular pathogens. The effector functions of T cells are mediated through cytokines/chemokines and by direct cytotoxicity of infected cells. T cell response can be beneficial or detrimental to host; prognosis depending on qualitative and quantitative differences in the response. Persistent viral infections are associated with functionally suboptimal, exhausted T cell responses, which are unable to clear virus. Specific subsets such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) dampen antiviral responses; thereby favouring viral persistence. However, Tregs protect the host from immunopathology by limiting perpetual inflammation. Certain other subsets such as Th17 cells may contribute to autoimmune component of viral infections. The importance of T cells is highlighted by the fact that modern vaccination and therapeutic approaches focus on modulating T cell frequencies and effector functions. This chapter emphasises the understanding how T cells influence outcomes of viral infections, modern vaccination and therapeutic strategies with thrust on T cell biology.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jagadeesh, Achanta; Prathyusha, A.

If you did not include a short abstract for the online version when you submitted the manuscript, the first paragraph or the first 10 lines of the chapter will be displayed here. If possible, please provide us with an informative abstract. Avian infectious bronchitis virus is the prototype of the gammacoronavirus, which is responsible for highly contagious disease in chicken. It continues to be one of the most common diseases in chicken and probably endemic in all countries that raise chicken. The virus infection causes considerable economic losses in both commercial meat- and egg-type birds. The virus tropism includes respiratory tract, proventriculus, cecal tonsils, oviduct and kidney. Infections mainly cause respiratory distress in young chickens. In broiler chicken,the virus causes respiratory distress but some strains produce interstitial nephritis while others cause proventriculitis. In laying hens, the virus causes considerable decrease in egg production and quality. Antigen detection and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are commonly used methods for rapid virus diagnosis. RT-PCR and direct gene sequence of the S1 gene or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are used for virus genotyping. The control strategy against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is conducted by live attenuated vaccine. To date, more than 65 genotypes and variants are characterized worldwide with poor cross protection. In addition, recombination could increase the variety of strains since live attenuated IBV vaccine viruses may recombine with virulent wild-type strains, and the resultant viruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease and production problems in chicken flocks.","publish_time":"2016-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S.","journal":"Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of Livestock","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cb9245da953670a5d642906fdb48a9e49d300c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","virus tropism","virus genotyping","rapid virus diagnosis","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","respiratory distress","chicken flocks","broiler chicken","respiratory tract","outbreaks of respiratory disease","RT-PCR","variety of strains","egg production","attenuated IBV vaccine viruses","live attenuated vaccine","short abstract","informative abstract","virulent wild-type strains","egg-type birds","S1 gene","considerable decrease","resultant viruses","production problems","contagious disease","used methods","online version","direct gene sequence","considerable economic losses","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","proventriculus","commercial meat","restriction fragment length polymorphism","cecal tonsils","RFLP","prototype","Antigen detection","interstitial nephritis","control strategy","oviduct","quality","young chickens","laying hens","variants","kidney","manuscript","recombination","common diseases","gammacoronavirus","Infections","countries","poor cross protection","lines","genotypes","paragraph","addition","proventriculitis","chapter","date"],"language":"en"},

Complications of acute coalescent mastoiditis are typically the subperiosteal abscess, due to the cortical bony necrosis of the mastoid and its septa, or the intracranial spread of the infection (meningitis, intracranial abscesses and venous sinus thrombosis). The general concept of management is exposed, with emphasis on the antimicrobial treatment and the different surgical options.","publish_time":"2018-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansour, Salah; Magnan, Jacques; Nicolas, Karen; Haidar, Hassan","journal":"Middle Ear Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51a50584b02c04e99a884224a8ddc39169e036b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122426/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complications of acute otitis media","Complications of acute coalescent mastoiditis","pathogenesis of coalescent acute mastoiditis","frequent manifestation of otitis media","risk factors","microbiological agents","intracranial abscesses","intracranial spread","antimicrobial treatment","General concepts","differential diagnosis","clinical manifestations","differential diagnoses","clinical features","multifactorial pathogenesis","different actual guidelines","different surgical options","general concept of management","meningitis","epidemiology","infection","subperiosteal abscess","venous sinus thrombosis","cortical bony necrosis","septa","common suppurative complication of AOM","chapter","emphasis","early childhood","specific imaging findings","efficient preventive measures","main issue"],"language":"en"},

Although efforts have been made so that the spread of future infectious diseases will be contained through early intervention, the actors in charge anticipate that the extant measures will fail to some degree. They believe it is simply impossible to prevent all pandemics from happening. But steps can and should be taken to lessen the impact of an unavoidable pandemic through emergency preparation. This chapter deals with organizations and organizational networks as key actors in these processes of emergency planning.

Although molecular methods are replacing many older methods of viral diagnosis, there is still a significant role for immunological methods to guide patient care and in the performance of epidemiologic studies. Identification of viral antigens in clinical samples can be accomplished rapidly through the use of point-of-care lateral immunoassays or through the use of more traditional immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays in the virology laboratory. Serological assays are also a valuable tool for the clinician and epidemiologist. Many of the available diagnostic assays have enzyme immunoassay formats, but functional assays such as hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralizing antibody tests are also available. In some instances, virus infection can be diagnosed with a single serum sample (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C virus infections) while in other instances paired sera are needed (e.g., those caused by common respiratory viruses). Point-of-care antibody assays are also available for testing blood and saliva samples for some viruses.

Sporadic cases and outbreaks have been reported with increased frequency since 2010 from Japan, the USA, and more recently from Europe. A feco-oral transmission route is suspected, and clinical or asymptomatic infected horses appear to be responsible for direct and indirect transmission of ECoV. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of ECoV infection may be suggested by clinical presentation and hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia due to lymphopenia and/or neutropenia. Confirmation of ECoV infection is provided by specific ECoV nucleic acid detection in feces by quantitative PCR or demonstration of coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy in intestinal biopsy material obtained ante- or postmortem. The disease is generally self-limiting and horses typically recover with symptomatic supportive care. Complications associated with disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier have been reported in some infected horses and include endotoxemia, septicemia, and hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy.

These viruses are endemic to specific geographic locations and typically cause relatively infrequent, self-limiting, but often devastating human disease outbreaks (e.g. Ebola virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Lassa virus). The overall rarity of disease outbreaks with the associated lack of clinical data and the requirement for research on Risk Group 4 pathogens to be performed in maximum (biosafety level 4) containment necessarily impede progress in medical countermeasure development. Next-generation technologies may aid to bridge the current gaps of knowledge by increasing the amount of useful data that can be gleaned from individual diagnostic samples, possibly even at point-of-care; enable personalized medicine approaches through genomic virus characterization in the clinic; refine our comprehension of pathogenesis by using ex vivo technologies such as organs-on-chips or organoids; identify novel correlates of protection or disease survival that could inform novel medical countermeasure development; or support patient and treatment response monitoring through non-invasive techniques such as medical imaging.

Due to their high infectiousness and easy person-to-person transmission, flu viruses repeatedly lead to pandemics (approx. 3 pandemics per century.). In contrast to an epidemic, a pandemic is not restricted to one area. The mortality of an influenza pandemic is greater than the seasonal flu wave, and is not restricted to the classical risk groups: high rates of infection can occur in all age groups, with peaks frequently occurring amongst young adults. The specific virological characteristics of the influenza virus represent a great challenge for the health system. In principle, any influenza virus which has never before \u2014 or at least not for a long time \u2014 circulated within the population can develop into a pandemic virus. One possible candidate amongst others appears to be the influenza virus A-H5N1. Influenza pandemics usually occur at intervals of 11 to 39 years, and 30 years have now passed since the last pandemic. At the moment, the national and international pandemic plans have in most cases not yet been completely worked out. The co-operation between the individual countries should be intensified, and in Germany in particular, efforts should be made \u2014 in view of the different concepts of the individual federal states \u2014 to arrive at a uniform action plan. The consequences of a pandemic affect both the economic and the social sphere. Hospitals, practicing doctors and public health services must jointly develop action plans in order to be able to care for large numbers of patients within a very short time. Occupational medical specialists should form a link between health services, companies and doctors and hospitals, and already be developing plans and their communication for the companies under their care.","publish_time":"2014-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wicker, Sabine; Dickmann, Petra; Rabenau, Holger F.; Gottschalk, Ren\u00E9","journal":"Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a54552ee49cea77f0fc58a7b720f518f27b92d7f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["pandemic virus","influenza virus","international pandemic plans","pandemic affect","Influenza pandemics","term pandemic","action plans","public health services","health system","companies","doctors","Hospitals","short time","long time","years","care","easy person","person transmission","flu viruses","age groups","high infectiousness","individual countries","high rates of infection","classical risk groups","seasonal flu wave","individual federal states","uniform action plan","link","different concepts","great challenge","infectious disease","worldwide outbreak","peaks","specific virological characteristics","population","large numbers of patients","Occupational medical specialists","efforts","view","order","moment","communication","mortality","intervals","cases","social sphere","Germany","young adults","co-operation","contrast","epidemic","consequences","century","principle","H5N1","possible candidate","area"],"language":"en"},

During the SARS crisis, China and the World Health Organization (WHO) entered a norm conflict over the precedence of sovereignty or global health security. Both resorted to behavioural, not discursive contestation: while the WHO practically but not rhetorically challenged the sovereignty norm by acting according to the norm of global health security, China\u2014without openly acknowledging it\u2014contravened the basic principles of global health security by acting according to the overlapping sovereignty norm. Why and with what consequences do actors choose to contest norms through actions rather than words? The article accounts for the resort to behavioural contestation by pointing to the strategic advantages it offers for furthering a contentious norm understanding without facing the social costs of making it explicit. It furthermore highlights that behavioural contestation may feed back into and change the odds of discursive contestation as its practical effects provide rhetorical resources to (de-)legitimate one or the other position.

NA1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter, had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml(\u22121).

NA1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 by SPIEM.

The unique characteristics in the tropical ecosystem along with the prevailing socioeconomic circumstances in the region make AKI in the tropics different regarding etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Community-acquired AKI caused by infections; animal, plant, or chemical toxins; and obstetric complications are common in the tropics, compared to predominantly hospital-acquired AKI from sepsis and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions elsewhere. It is possible to discern certain distinct \u201CAKI syndromes\u201D in the tropics, like febrile illness with AKI, envenomation-related AKI, and obstetric AKI, where the patients develop AKI along with a typical constellation of clinical features, allowing more specific and quick diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Changes in disease epidemiology and ongoing socioeconomic transitions in the tropics are reflected in changing epidemiology of tropical AKI. While the incidence of obstetric AKI has shown a steady decline, HIV-associated AKI emerged as a significant entity in regions where HIV was endemic in the past few decades. There is better recognition of scrub typhus as a significant contributor to AKI with availability of better diagnostic techniques, and it is well recognized that the epidemiology of AKI associated with post-infectious glomerulonephritis is different in the tropics. Rapid urbanization has made large swaths of population susceptible to emerging infections like dengue fever, with increased incidence of AKI. Climate change and scarcity of potable water are expected to pose significant challenges to kidney health in the tropics in the future. However, community-acquired AKI in the tropics also presents a unique opportunity for prevention of AKI, and attendant morbidity and mortality as most of the contributing factors can be addressed by public health interventions and innovative strategies to deliver healthcare.","publish_time":"2018-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parameswaran, Sreejith; Jha, Vivekanand","journal":"Core Concepts in Acute Kidney Injury","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c17bed187fe0f6156e7e7b0cbec91efeb9a9e5a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119979.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of AKI","characteristics of AKI","prevention of AKI","AKI syndromes","incidence of obstetric AKI","HIV-associated AKI","increased incidence of AKI","envenomation-related AKI","changing epidemiology of tropical AKI","tropics different","clinical characteristics","unique characteristics","significant contributor","significant entity","significant challenges","infections","obstetric complications","disease epidemiology","quick diagnostic","therapeutic interventions","Community","availability of better diagnostic techniques","public health interventions","kidney health","tropical ecosystem","therapeutic approach","unique opportunity","ongoing socioeconomic transitions","prevailing socioeconomic circumstances","typical constellation of clinical features","better recognition of scrub typhus","dengue fever","large swaths of population susceptible","etiology","steady decline","chemical toxins","post-infectious glomerulonephritis","scarcity of potable water","innovative strategies","mortality","animal","sepsis","febrile illness","Climate change","plant","regions","Changes","attendant morbidity","patients","Rapid urbanization","contributing factors","past","healthcare","outcomes","hospital","decades","future","setting"],"language":"en"},

Although surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens for liver transplantation have improved significantly over the past 20 years, infectious complications continue to contribute to the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. The use of standardized screening protocols for both donors and recipients, coupled with targeted prophylaxis against specific pathogens, has helped to mitigate the risk of infection in liver transplant recipients. Patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis have immunological deficits that place them at increased risk for infection while awaiting liver transplantation. The patient undergoing liver transplantation is prone to develop healthcare-acquired infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms that could potentially affect patient outcomes after transplantation. The complex nature of liver transplant surgery that involves multiple vascular and hepatobiliary anastomoses further increases the risk of infection after liver transplantation. During the early post-transplantation period, healthcare-acquired bacterial and fungal infections are the most common types of infection encountered in liver transplant recipients. The period of maximal immunosuppression that occurs at 1\u20136 months after transplantation can be complicated by opportunistic infections due to both primary infection and reactivation of latent infection. Severe community-acquired infections can complicate the course of liver transplantation beyond 12 months after transplant surgery. This chapter provides an overview of liver transplantation including indications, donor-recipient selection criteria, surgical procedures, and immunosuppressive therapies. A focus on infections in patients with chronic liver disease/cirrhosis and an overview of the specific infectious complications in liver transplant recipients are presented.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohanraj, B.

New genetic knowledge and technology have quickly developed over the past 30 years, particularly within the past decade, and have made many optimistic about our ability to explain autism. Among these advances include the sequencing of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001) and the identification of common genetic variants via the HapMap project (International HapMap Consortium, 2005), and the development of cost-efficient genotyping and analysis technologies (Losh, Sullivan, Trembath, \u0026 Piven, 2008). Improvement in technology has led to improved visualization of chromosomal abnormality down to the molecular level. The four most common syndromes associated with autism include fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, 15q duplications, and untreated phenylketonuria (PKU; Costa e Silva, 2008). FXS and 15q duplications are discussed within the context of cytogenetics. TSC is illustrated within the description of linkage analysis.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sokol, Deborah K.; Lahiri, Debomoy K.","journal":"International Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2706bb9d4f3806e6f1bbd18849aa021d223d234b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sullivan"],"organizations":["FXS","TSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["q duplications","genetics of autism accessible","technology","HapMap project","analysis technologies","identification of common genetic variants","common syndromes","past decade","International HapMap Consortium","New genetic knowledge","description of linkage analysis","untreated phenylketonuria","tuberous sclerosis","fragile X syndrome","Losh","PKU","Sullivan","practitioners","improved visualization of chromosomal abnormality","Costa e Silva","development of cost-efficient genotyping","sequencing","Trembath","field","human genome","Lander","molecular level","children","years","advances","Piven","context of cytogenetics","Improvement","ability","FXS","chapter","TSC"],"language":"en"},

Tobacco smoke and emissions from combustion of fossil fuel and biomass fuel are the major airborne pollutants affecting human lung health. Oxidative stress is the dominant driving force by which the airborne pollutants exert their toxicity in lungs and cause respiratory diseases. Most airborne pollutants are associated with intrinsic oxidative potential and, additionally, stimulate endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Elevated ROS and RNS in lungs modulate redox signals and cause irreversible damage to critical biomolecules (lipids, proteins and DNA) and initiate various pathogenic cellular process. This chapter provides an insight into oxidative stress-linked pathogenic cellular process such as lipid peroxidation, inflammation, cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, epigenetic changes, profibrotic signals and mucus hypersecretion, which drive the development and progression of lung diseases. Lungs are associated with robust enzymatic and non-enzymatic (GSH, ascorbic acid, uric acid, vitamin E) antioxidant defences. However, sustained production of free radicals due to continuous exposures to airborne pollutants overwhelms lung antioxidant defences and causes oxidative injury. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the critical roles and therapeutic potential of upregulating lung antioxidants for intervention of respiratory diseases; however, so far clinical benefits in antioxidant supplementation trials have been minimal and conflicting. Antioxidants alone may not be effective in treatment of respiratory diseases; however it could be a promising adjunctive therapy.","publish_time":"2019-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thimmulappa, Rajesh K.; Chattopadhyay, Indranil; Rajasekaran, Subbiah","journal":"Oxidative Stress in Lung Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c75f4e2f629bd48b8bc9fa568e514b538e2f18b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Oxidative stress","major airborne pollutants","progression of lung diseases","intervention of respiratory diseases","treatment of respiratory diseases","lung antioxidant defences","lungs","oxidative injury","intrinsic oxidative potential","therapeutic potential of upregulating lung antioxidants","human lung health","RNS","major cause of disability","various pathogenic cellular process","endoplasmic reticulum stress","antioxidant supplementation trials","reactive nitrogen species","endogenous production of reactive oxygen species","ascorbic acid","uric acid","biomass fuel","critical roles","profibrotic signals","critical biomolecules","redox signals","Elevated ROS","combustion of fossil fuel","sustained production of free radicals","epigenetic changes","GSH","cell death","mitochondrial dysfunction","inflammation","lipid peroxidation","continuous exposures","irreversible damage","vitamin E","lipids","DNA","mucus hypersecretion","dominant driving force","emissions","proteins","development","toxicity","clinical benefits","insight","Tobacco smoke","Preclinical studies","mortality","chapter","poor quality of air","promising adjunctive therapy","developing countries"],"language":"en"},

In the past the diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make a diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, (c) indirect detection of virus-specific antibodies. While being important tools in the diagnostic virology today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific tools such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, purified antigens. In the past decade the number of new molecular-based methods grew rapidly and gained more popularity in diagnostic labs. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in ref. [1]). The most nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speed, sensitive and specific and thus meet the gold four-S-standard for their application in any diagnostic laboratories. The methods are simple and speed because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are needed in a lab setting and identification of a viral pathogen takes within few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patients\u2019 materials to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and even to identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time.

Previously, we have studied the bacterial, fungal, and allergen aerosol inactivation by direct microwave irradiation. Here, we further investigated its effects on airborne viruses. MS2 coliphage used as a human model virus was aerosolized and exposed to the direct microwave irradiation for ~2 min at three different power levels (700, 385, and 119 W). In addition to the survival rate, the viral genes before and after the microwave treatments were also examined using PCR and gel electrophoresis. Direct exposure of airborne MS2 viruses to the microwave irradiation at 700 W for less than 2 min was shown to result in more than 90 % inactivation efficiency, about 65 % at medium power level (385 W), and 50 % at the lowest level (119 W). The aerosol inactivation rate followed a linear relationship with the microwave exposure time (R (2) = 0.9889). Scanning electron images revealed visible damages to the viral surface after the exposure. Damages were also observed to the viral RNA genes coding for coat proteins, among which the A protein gene was completely destroyed. This study demonstrated that even without the filtration the direct microwave irradiation could also achieve rapid inactivation of viral aerosols. The information obtained can provide useful guidance on the development of microwave-based viral threat mitigation solutions in a closed or semi-closed space.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yan; Yao, Maosheng","journal":"Chin Sci Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1dba37d029616f493bad86f326925169b7d2d88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["direct microwave irradiation","development of microwave","microwave treatments","microwave exposure time","viral genes","viral surface","rapid inactivation of viral aerosols","aerosol inactivation rate","Direct exposure of airborne MS2 viruses","inactivation efficiency","allergen aerosol inactivation","viral RNA genes coding","viral threat mitigation solutions","airborne viruses","medium power level","MS2 coliphage","survival rate","visible damages","lowest level","semi-closed space","human model virus","different power levels","linear relationship","coat proteins","tremendous costs","PCR","useful guidance","filtration","Infectious diseases","electron images","economy","gel electrophoresis","information","addition","effects","protein gene","study"],"language":"en"},

The first aim of study was to determine the difference in frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes (FNEs) according to months and seasons. The second aim was to document isolated pathogens, as well as demographical and clinical characteristics of patients. METHODS: In the study, 194 FNEs of 105 patients who have been followed with hematological malignancies between June 2013 and May 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Although the number of FNEs increased in autumn, there was no significant difference in frequency of FNEs between months (p = 0.564) and seasons (p = 0.345). There was no isolated pathogen in 54.6% of FNEs. In 45.4% of 194 FNEs, pathogens were isolated. Of all pathogens, 50.4% were gram negative bacteria, 29.2% were gram positive bacteria, 13.3% were viruses, 5.3% were fungi, and 1.8% were parasites. CONCLUS\u0130ONS: The frequency of FEN does not change according to months or seasons. Also, the relative proportions of different pathogens in the cause of FEN do not vary according to seasons.","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6zdemir, Seray Karag\u00F6z; Iltar, Utku; Salim, Ozan; Y\u00FCcel, Orhan Kemal; Erdem, Ramazan; Turhan, \u00D6zge; Undar, Levent","journal":"Memo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3752cbe86c5d6f79eb3a63f09e462c3e711f856b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasons","frequency of FNEs","number of FNEs","isolated pathogens","frequency of FEN","neutropenic patients","months","cause of FEN","risk of febrile neutropenia","frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes","hematological malignancies","clinical characteristics of patients","aim of study","change","relative proportions of different pathogens","gram positive bacteria","gram negative bacteria","significant difference","important cause of mortality","Various risk factors","severe infection","frequent complication","autumn","viruses","BACKGROUND","fungi","RESULTS","CONCLUS\u0130ONS","best","knowledge","parasites","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

MHV-3 nucleocapsid gene transcripts were identified in multiple organs including lungs, spleen etc. As a representative proinflammatory gene, mfgl2 prothrombinase expression was evident in terminal and respiratory bronchioles, alveolar epithelia and infiltrated cells in the lungs associated with fibrin deposition and micro-vascular thrombosis. In summary, the established murine SARS model could mimic the pathologic characteristics of lungs in patients with SARS. Besides the physical damages due to virus replication in organs, the up-regulation of novel gene mfgl2 in lungs may play a vital role in the development of SARS associated lung damage.","publish_time":"2008-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei-ming, Yan; Jia-quan, Huang; Xiao-ping, Luo; Qin, Ning","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65b7f07b1e4fa3e1c53d7b3f5097592073a16488.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["established murine SARS model","development of SARS","Murine hepatitis virus","role of murine fibrinogen","regulation of novel gene mfgl2","pathologic characteristics of lungs","MHV","presence of micro-vascular thrombosis","mfgl2 prothrombinase expression","representative proinflammatory gene","nucleocapsid gene transcripts","respiratory bronchioles","lung impairment","multiple organs","lung damage","virus replication","vital role","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","terminal","extensive hyaline membranes formation","alveoli","alveolar epithelia","interstitial pneumonia","infiltrated cells","fibroleukin","spleen","fibrin deposition","protein","animals","pulmonary vessels","patients","summary","physical damages","trachea"],"language":"en"},

Although CMV reactivation often becomes a serious problem in immunocompromised patients, the prevalence of CMV reactivation caused by methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy has yet to be determined. METHOD: Among 175 consecutive patients with thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection at Akita University Hospital between 2007 and 2010, 11 patients (6.3 %) diagnosed with ARDS during the acute phase of esophagectomy were enrolled and treated with steroid pulse therapy, high-dose (15\u201320 mg/kg/day) administration and tapering in this retrospective study. RESULTS: Seven of the 11 patients (63.6 %) were diagnosed with CMV reactivation based on CMV antigenemia assayed 19.1 days after the start of methylprednisolone administration and were treated with ganciclovir for 39.6 days. Six of the 7 patients (85.7 %) diagnosed with CMV reactivation were administered a total methylprednisolone dose of more than 4,000 mg. Though there was no significant difference between patients with and without CMV reactivation, there was a tendency that patients with CMV reactivation showed a lower minimum number of lymphocytes during the acute phase of esophagectomy (p = 0.051, Student\u2019s t test, average 223.3 and 298.0/\u03BCl, respectively). CONCLUSION: Though the number of study patients is small, the prevalence of CMV reactivation caused by high-dose methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy is remarkably high. This result strikes a note of warning concerning the management of these patients and suggests the importance of screenings for CMV reactivation so as to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate treatment in a timely manner.","publish_time":"2012-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Yusuke; Motoyama, Satoru; Maruyama, Kiyotomi; Yoshino, Key; Sasaki, Tomohiko; Wakita, Akiyuki; Ogawa, Jun-ichi","journal":"Esophagus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6edc625743325bf825f4172dcec8f8711039d9af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV","ARDS","Akita University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of CMV reactivation","CMV antigenemia","consecutive patients","immunocompromised patients","number of study patients","high-dose methylprednisolone therapy","acute phase of esophagectomy","ARDS","total methylprednisolone dose","start of methylprednisolone administration","days","steroid pulse therapy","retrospective study","lower minimum number of lymphocytes","extensive lymph node dissection","thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancer","Akita University Hospital","serious problem","initiate treatment","tendency","Student\u2019s t test","accurate diagnosis","Cytomegalovirus","infection","importance of screenings","timely manner","note of warning","management","BACKGROUND","ganciclovir","significant difference","CONCLUSION","METHOD","\u03BCl","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In response, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene carried out a series of unannounced \u201CMystery Patient Drills\u201D to assess Emergency Departments (ED) ability to identify and safely respond to patients with communicable diseases of public health concern. METHODS: All 911-receiving hospitals participating in the NYC Hospital Preparedness Program were recruited to participate. Scenarios utilized an actor presenting to an ED describing symptoms and history consistent with measles or MERS-CoV. An exercise evaluation guide captured performance measures to analyze 1) compliance with key infection control measures; 2) association between screening interventions (e.g., travel history) and implementation of infection control measures; 3) times from patient entry to triage, donning a mask, and placement into isolation. Post-drill report narratives were reviewed to identify additional strengths and challenges. RESULTS: Among 50 eligible hospitals, 49 participated in 2 drills (N = 98) during December 2015\u2013May 2016. Three pilot drills were excluded from the analysis. The patient was masked and isolated in 78% of drills; 61% of hospitals completed this process in both drills. Masking and isolation was observed in a higher proportion of drills when travel history was obtained, compared with drills when travel history was not obtained (88% vs. 21%; P \u003C 0.0001). The median time from patient entry to masking was 1 minute and 9 minutes to placement into isolation. Overall, 36% of staff practiced hand hygiene and 77% entered the isolation room wearing Personal Protective Equipment. Identified best practices include the use of triage questionnaires to identify high-risk patients and algorithms to guide masking and isolation procedures. CONCLUSION: ED staff\u2019s ability to identify potentially infectious patients and implement recommended control measures varied. Drill findings were used to inform hospital improvement planning and will guide citywide efforts to improve healthcare system readiness for communicable diseases through addressing identified gaps and supporting implementation of best practice recommendations.

METHODS: Healthy adults admitted to the NIH Clinical Center (Day -1) underwent a 9 day inpatient quarantine after intranasal challenge with H1N1pdm (Day 0). Participants completed the 32 item FLU-PRO diary twice daily for 14 days to assess presence and severity of symptoms across six body systems. Secondary analyses included descriptive statistics to examine FLU-PRO scores over the course of illness and analysis of variance to compare severity scores on Day 3 post-challenge by viral shedding, and pre-challenge hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition (HAI and NAI) titers. RESULTS: 61 of 65 subjects reported symptoms (Days: Median 5, Mean 6 \u00B1 7), of which 37 (61%) had viral shedding. Pre-challenge, 39 (64%) and 10 (16%) subjects had low (\u003C40) HAI and NAI titers, respectively. Mean daily FLU-PRO symptom severity domain and total scores are shown in Figure 1. Symptoms were present across all FLU-PRO domains from Day 1 post-challenge. Nose, throat, body, and GI symptoms reached peak severity at Day 3, followed by chest and eye symptoms at Day 4. Subjects with viral shedding had significantly higher mean FLU-PRO scores compared with those without, except for Eye and GI domains (P \u003C .05); mean FLU-PRO scores were significantly higher for subjects with low NAI titer (P \u003C .05) across all domains. No significant differences were observed between HAI titer groups. FLU-PRO scores of the low HAI-low NAI group (n = 10) were significantly higher (more severe) than the other two groups (P \u003C .05) ((high HAI-low NAI (n = 22), low HAI-high NAI (n = 29)). CONCLUSION: The FLU-PRO can be used to track symptom onset, severity, and recovery from influenza infection in clinical research. In this challenge study, scores were responsive to change even in mild disease and distinguished known clinical subgroups. The use of NAI as an independent predictor of influenza disease severity was also supported.

Healthcare professionals use tools such as FluView to help identify local pathogen circulation; however, these tools are limited to syndromic surveillance, and track a limited set of pathogens. Understanding respiratory disease dynamics requires 1) a large, pathogen rich data set 2) geographically dispersed data sources, and 3) fine temporal resolution. Here we utilize FilmArray\u00AE Trend, a research epidemiology system containing exported data from FilmArray\u00AE Respiratory Panel (RP) tests, to investigate geographic patterns of 20 common pathogens. METHODS: Over 6,000,000 individual pathogen assays from 19 clinical sites were exported to the Trend database from 2013 to present. Trend data were smoothed and normalized to produce the time series of pathogen incidence. A cross-correlation analysis was performed to compare sites to one another and determine offset of pathogen incidence. The results were plotted on a map of the US with visual indicators of correlation strength and directional movement as defined by cross-correlation lag values. RESULTS: The respiratory pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test show a diverse set of spatial and temporal behaviors Most striking was the spread of the virus Coronavirus OC43, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with RSV traveling from east coast sites to west coast sites across the US over 20 days. In contrast Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) shows a small cross-correlation lag across all of the Trend sites during the regular summer season, indicating near simultaneous onset of detection nationwide. A localized cluster of PIV3 in the winter of 2016 was observed in the midwest and west, identifying the significance of localized regional trends. CONCLUSION: FilmArray Trend shows great promise in deciphering spatiotemporal dynamics of these common respiratory pathogens. This system can identify localized outbreaks and directional movement of pathogens over time. Future work with finer geographic distribution of contributing sites will aide in making conclusions regarding spatial dynamics of all 20 RP pathogens. Other pathogen transmission models may also be explored using this data set. DISCLOSURES: C. Cook, BioFire Diagnostics: Employee, Salary. A. Wallin, BioFire Defense: Employee, Salary. A.

{"cord_uid":"15dcbib0","sha":null,"source_x":"PMC","title":"Long-term Respiratory Complication in Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 1-year Follow-up After the 2015 Outbreak in South Korea","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofx163.1508","pmcid":"PMC7107210","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are few data about long-term respiratory complications following Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. This study aimed to evaluate respiratory functions and radiologic sequelae according to the severity of infection one year after the patients experienced MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: A total of 73 patients undergoing MERS-CoV infection during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea were enrolled in this prospective multicenter study. Pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walking tests were performed 1 year after infection. Radiologic sequelae was defined as fibrosis or atelectasis on chest computer tomography and severe pneumonia was defined as that requiring oxygen therapy. Multivariate linear regression tests were used to evaluate the effect of infection severity on respiratory function. RESULTS: At the time of MERS-CoV infection, 18 patients had no pneumonia, 35 experienced mild pneumonia, and 20 did severe pneumonia. The median age was not different between groups (P = 0.942). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was 102.6%, 94.9%, and 88.7% in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia group, respectively (P = 0.010) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 105.3%, 95.7%, and 91.7% (P = 0.057). Diffusing capacity (DLCO) was significantly lower in the severe pneumonia group than in the no or mild pneumonia group (78.3% vs. 89.4% or 88.6%, P = 0.035). In multivariate analyses, FVC and DLCO were significantly correlated with infection severity after adjustment with age, sex, underlying lung disease, and smoking. There was no difference in the walking distance of 6 minute tests between groups. Radiologic sequelae were shown in 18.8%, 65.6%, and 100% in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia group, respectively (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: The patients with more severe pneumonia by MERS-CoV had more impaired respiratory function in one year follow-up, which was compatible with radiologic sequelae.

Meanwhile corporate interest in serious gaming in business has rapidly grown internationally. However the level of awareness and adoption of serious gaming among South African corporates in business is still unclear. This interpretive study explores South African corporate awareness of serious gaming in business and the barriers to its adoption. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from managers in Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies. Eight participants were interviewed across four different industries. Data analysis was guided by the general inductive approach. The absence of serious gaming adopters among the participants, and the general lack of awareness of serious gaming in business were identified as the most salient features. The analysis suggests that corporates currently use technologies related to serious games (e-learning, collaborative tools, and simulation tools), and that there is a demand for the greater promotion and use of serious gaming. While the findings provide new insights into the level of serious gaming awareness, caution should be exercised when attempting to generalize these findings due to the small sample and the scarcity of prior research.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amod, Shiraz; Roodt, Sumarie","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16502c47ce3389b7080a36132066ca42e5e2ff15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134228.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South"],"keyphrases":["adoption of serious gaming","level of serious gaming awareness","serious games","absence of serious gaming adopters","South African corporate awareness of serious gaming","business","level of awareness","general lack of awareness","South African corporates","participants","Data analysis","findings","qualitative data","collaborative tools","simulation tools","general inductive approach","managers","military","e-learning","Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies","interpretive study","technologies","small sample","new insights","healthcare","greater promotion","scarcity of prior research","barriers","caution","education sectors","Semi-structured interviews","demand","different industries","salient features"],"language":"en"},

We theorize that the diffusion of particular content on Twitter can be driven by a sequence of nouns, adjectives, adverbs forming a sentence. We exhibit that the proposed approach is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of tweets to a common choice of words while constructing a sentence to express an opinion or sentiment. Through this paper, we propose a Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) to study the degree of diffusion of content (retweet on Twitter). Our framework first extracts the words, create a matrix of these words using the sequences in the tweet text. To this sequence matrix we further multiply custom weights basis the presence index in a sentence wherein higher weights are given if the impactful class of tokens/words like nouns, adjectives are used at the beginning of the sentence than at last. We then try to predict the possibility of diffusion of information using Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network architecture, which in turn is further optimized on the accuracy and training execution time by a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The results of the proposed CWWE are compared to a pre-trained glove word embedding. For experimentation, we created a corpus of size 230,000 tweets posted by more than 45,000 users in 6 months. Research experimentations reveal that using the proposed framework of Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) from the tweet there is a significant improvement in the overall accuracy of Deep Learning framework model in predicting information diffusion through tweets.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kushwaha, Amit Kumar; Kar, Arpan Kumar; Vigneswara Ilavarasan, P.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab762ff2378fd3628198dfc187c9ad1205de8415.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Custom Weighted","Convolutional Neural Network","CWWE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sentence","diffusion rate","degree of diffusion","proposed CWWE","possibility of diffusion","proposed framework of Custom Weighted Word","predicting information diffusion","diffusion of particular content","presence of certain words","common choice of words","custom weights basis","proposed approach","adjectives","sequence of nouns","Twitter","sequence matrix","tweet text","Convolutional Neural Network architecture","overall accuracy of Deep Learning framework model","intrinsic disposition of tweets","Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network architecture","presence index","higher weights","pre-trained glove word","sentiment analysis","training execution time","impactful class of tokens","various drivers","significant improvement","turn","retweet","sequences","adverbs","corpus of size","Research experimentations","Researchers","users","paper","opinion","beginning","results","months"],"language":"en"},

We conduct an experiment with 23 experienced users in online shopping, capture gaze behavior and through employing machine learning we examine how fast we can accurately predict their ratings. The findings show that after 25 s we can predict ratings with an error rate ranging from 9% to 11% depending on which facet of visual aesthetic is examined. Furthermore, within the first 15 s we can have a good and sufficient prediction for simplicity and colorfulness, with error rates 11% and 12% respectively. For diversity and craftsmanship, 20 s are needed to get a good and sufficient prediction similar to the one from 25 s.

However, studies have shown that mobile learning (m-learning) can be used to mitigate the challenges of STEM education. Despite, the benefits of mobile learning to rural STEM learners, its full potential has not been realized because the adoption of m-learning depends on users\u2019 acceptance. Prior studies focused on teachers\u2019 and learners\u2019 acceptance of mobile learning. However, little is known about parents\u2019 acceptance of m-learning, especially in rural areas. This study explores the acceptance of m-learning by parents of rural high school STEM learners. The study proposes the parents\u2019 acceptance of m-learning model, which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing perceived social influence and perceived resources. Stratified random sampling was used to select 200 parents in the survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PSL-SEM) was used to analyze data from 129 valid questionnaires. The proposed model explained 41% of the variance in parents\u2019 acceptance of mobile learning. Attitude towards the use was found to be the best predictor and the only factor that have a direct effect on behavioral intention to use mobile learning. However, all other factors have an indirect influence on behavioral intention. The findings revealed that for mobile learning to be successfully implemented in rural areas, resources need to be provided.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mutambara, David; Bayaga, Anass","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/903faad7a921392d6e9ebe13bd4101a13cbf1554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["learning model","parents\u2019 acceptance of mobile learning","learners\u2019 acceptance of mobile learning","benefits of mobile learning","technology acceptance model","users\u2019 acceptance","rural STEM learners","rural areas","challenges of STEM education","parents of rural high school STEM learners","behavioral intention","perceived resources","proposed model","study","perceived social influence","indirect influence","Prior studies","learners\u2019 poor performance","South African\u2019s high schools","matriculation level","Science","emphasis","infancy","Engineering","squares structural equation modeling","teachers\u2019","PSL-SEM","Mathematics","variance","direct effect","data","factors","potential","best predictor","valid questionnaires","findings","random sampling","Attitude","survey","adoption"],"language":"en"},

We provide examples of changes company-level, industry-level as well as societal changes where cryptocurrencies have played a central role. On a company level, cryptocurrencies provide a cost-efficient means for cross-border money transfer and thus pose a significant threat to the existing intermediary-based business models. On an industry level, many central banks are experimenting with crypto- or digital currencies. On a societal level, cryptocurrencies play an important role in particularly when the traditional institutions and societal structures collapse. For example, in Venezuela\u2019s recent political and economic crisis, cryptocurrencies contributed to the development of a parallel financial system when the bolivar practically lost its value.

Not surprisingly, organizations are increasingly adopting data governance as a means to ensure that the quality of data entering the data lake is and remains of sufficient quality, and to ensure the organization remains legally compliant. The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. For this, a case study regarding the governance of data in a data lake in the asset management domain is analyzed to test three propositions contributing to the success of using data science. The results show that unambiguous ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of standard and specific compliance requirements are important factors for maintaining data quality and compliance and building trust in data science products.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brous, Paul; Janssen, Marijn; Krans, Rutger","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/543300ae579c6d2b470c51dd8395e7d897cce3ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134294.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of data","data quality","governance of data","big data","data lakes","data science initiatives","data science models","data science products","role of data governance","nature data intensive","sufficient quality","asset management organizations","asset management domain","trust","case study","success factor","decision-outcomes","decision-makers","specific compliance requirements","important factors","controlled overview of standard","assets","predictive maintenance","bridges","variety of architectures","dykes","railways","technologies","anomaly detection","roads","unambiguous ownership","means","results","propositions","objective"],"language":"en"},

We explore this claim and other consequences for knowledge workers using data from a sequential quantitative-qualitative, mixed-method study in Norway. 88 RPA users from different sectors and industries where first surveyed to identify differences in utilization and effects from RPA. Then, differences were explored in 24 in-depth interviews in the public and private sectors, including financial industry, manufacturing, and oil and gas. Results indicate that RPA is used to either layoff or not reemploy knowledge workers, but also to empower knowledge workers with more interesting tasks. Private sector was different from public sector in that private, financial companies have experienced the strongest reduction in the need for employment. RPA often lead to layoffs indirectly, and to reduced need for consultants, especially in financial companies. In contrast, public companies use RPA more for innovations in their service production from increased quality in data registration, handling of invoices, and data migration between systems. We conclude that RPA is maturing as a management tool motivated by cost reductions from reduced employment, and we suggest propositions for further research.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eikebrokk, Tom Roar; Olsen, Dag H\u00E5kon","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff61001476757ed242faa71a4d977012dd6640d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPA"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["RPA users","financial companies","public companies","free knowledge workers","private sectors","public sector","data registration","data migration","different sectors","financial industry","interesting tasks","differences","reduced employment","need","mundane tasks","tenacious claim","interesting work","literature","increased quality","handling of invoices","service production","sequential quantitative-qualitative","industries","innovations","robotic process automation","mixed-method study","cost reductions","manufacturing","strongest reduction","management tool","in-depth interviews","oil","utilization","consequences","Norway","systems","propositions","effects","consultants","contrast","paper","gas","layoffs","research","Results"],"language":"en"},

A Quantitative methodological approach was adopted which relied on the Partial Least Square approach to Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) for the statistical analysis. Seemingly, FOFL and FORD constructs were not seen to be a significant direct predictor of online purchase intention. However, the mediating effect of OSPCON for both FOFL and FORD towards online purchase intention in the Ghanaian context was found to be significant, hence the mediated-hypotheses were supported. Nonetheless, we have highlighted the need for additional and further research taking a cue from the study\u2019s limitations. The study contributes to our knowledge of how online identity theft practices lead to the unwillingness of online customers to embark on online transactions in an emerging economy, given the rampant outburst of online transactions in the developed world.

In this chapter we describe some of our latest investigations into the structure and function of two such accessory proteins: ORF3a and 9b. The ORF3a accessory protein is the largest accessory protein in SARS-CoV and is a unique membrane protein consisting of three transmembrane domains. It colocalizes on the cell membrane and host Golgi networks and may be involved in ion channel formation during infection. Similarly the ORF9b accessory protein is 98 amino acids, associates with the spike and nucleocapsid proteins and has unusual membrane binding properties. In this chapter we have suggested possible new roles for these two accessory proteins which may in the long run contain answers to many unanswered questions and also give us new ideas for drugs and vaccine design.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Wei; Xu, Ke; Sun, Bing","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123986.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123986/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accessory proteins","ORF3a accessory protein","largest accessory protein","ORF9b accessory protein","nucleocapsid proteins","unique membrane protein","SARS-CoV","cell membrane","chapter","new ideas","unusual membrane binding properties","SARS coronavirus","possible new roles","host Golgi networks","positive-stranded RNA viral genome","open reading frames","spike","amino acids","associates","unanswered questions","long run","function","answers","drugs","vaccine design","structure","latest investigations","ion channel formation","transmembrane domains","infection","ORFs","colocalizes","virulence"],"language":"en"},

It stabilizes critical derangements of oxygenation and ventilation, allowing time to diagnose, treat, and recover from the underlying cause of organ failure. The extracorporeal circuit has three main components: large-bore cannulae and circuit tubing to provide access to the native circulation, an artificial membrane lung to provide gas exchange, and an active pump to facilitate perfusion. Multiple clinical studies have evaluated this technology, the strongest evidence to date supporting its use being the Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial, which showed survival advantage when patients were treated with a protocol that included ECMO. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) is similar in concept to ECMO, but has a lower flow rate and does not significantly oxygenate the patient. It is a primary treatment for hypercarbic respiratory failure or is an adjunct to reduce potentially injurious levels of mechanical ventilator support in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Complications are common occurrences on both types of therapy. Strong institutional commitment and a team approach are critical to successful implementation.

These diseases are commonly encountered in the tropical regions of the world. However, parasitic lung diseases are increasingly being reported from other parts of the world due to an increase in the occurrence of immunosuppression (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, organ transplantations, the use of immunosuppressive drugs) and transcontinental travel. The lung diseases that may result from these infections range from asymptomatic phase to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome. These diseases can also mimic common respiratory diseases such as bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchial asthma, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of parasitic lung diseases is a challenge to physicians, if they are not aware of the entity or these diseases are not investigated properly. The diagnosis of these diseases is based on the identification of the causative organism in the stool, sputum, other body fluids, or tissue specimens. Radiological imaging studies of the thorax including chest radiographs, high-resolution computerized tomograms, and ultrasonograms may aid in the diagnosis. In certain situations, invasive investigations such as fiberoptic bronchoscopic evaluation (transbronchial lung biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage studies) and thoracic surgical procedures (thoracoscopy and open lung biopsy) may be required for a diagnosis and also to exclude other lung diseases. Serologic and molecular diagnostic methods are being developed for accurate diagnosis of the parasitic diseases.","publish_time":"2013-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijayan, Vannan K.","journal":"Parasitic Diseases of the Lungs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a88a67726672d93e4b3a2807791c0e64499ee029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of parasitic lung diseases","parasitic diseases","common respiratory diseases","lung cancer","transbronchial lung biopsies","interstitial lung disease","open lung biopsy","accurate diagnosis","respiratory tract","world","life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome","pulmonary tuberculosis","immunodeficiency syndrome","gastrointestinal tract","pulmonary hypertension","common habitats","helminthic parasites","bronchoalveolar lavage studies","Radiological imaging studies","fiberoptic bronchoscopic evaluation","thoracic surgical procedures","bronchial asthma","bacterial pneumonias","thorax","chest radiographs","asymptomatic phase","invasive investigations","organ transplantations","thoracoscopy","high-resolution computerized tomograms","use of immunosuppressive drugs","body fluids","stool","sputum","life cycles","occurrence of immunosuppression","causative organism","molecular diagnostic methods","blood","ultrasonograms","infections","physicians","challenge","transcontinental travel","certain situations","lymphatic circulations","tissue specimens","increase","identification","tropical regions","entity","parts"],"language":"en"},

Throughout the tropics, the staggering pace of deforestation, logging, and conversion of forested habitat to other land uses has created highly fragmented landscapes that are increasingly dominated by human-modified habitats and degraded forests. In this chapter, we review the responses of tropical bats to a range of land-use change scenarios, focusing on the effects of habitat fragmentation, logging, and conversion of tropical forest to various forms of agricultural production. Recent landscape-scale studies have considerably advanced our understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat fragmentation and disturbance at the population, ensemble, and assemblage level. This research emphasizes that responses of bats are often species and ensemble specific, sensitive to spatial scale, and strongly molded by the characteristics of the prevailing landscape matrix. Nonetheless, substantial knowledge gaps exist concerning other types of response by bats. Few studies have assessed responses at the genetic, behavioral, or physiological level, with regard to disease prevalence, or the extent to which human disturbance erodes the capacity of tropical bats to provide key ecosystem services. A strong geographic bias, with Asia and, most notably, Africa, being strongly understudied, precludes a comprehensive understanding of the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on tropical bats. We strongly encourage increased research in the Paleotropics and emphasize the need for long-term studies, approaches designed to integrate multiple scales, and answering questions that are key to conserving tropical bats in an era of environmental change and dominance of modified habitats (i.e., the Anthropocene).","publish_time":"2015-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Christoph F.

Students were assessed for their scientific inquiry ability at the beginning and the end of the learning process using five instruments: experimental skill test, students\u2019 laboratory reports, students\u2019 science projects, semi-structured interview and classroom observation. The results showed that the STS-based learning unit on biological control helped students gain significant improvement in scientific inquiry. They were able to apply and integrate the scientific knowledge learned in both classroom and field studies to help solve agricultural problems in their own communities.

One segment can recombine with another in regions that share little sequence similarity. Although the recombination is therefore heterologous, the crossover points usually consist of two to six identical nucleotides. The frequency of recombinants is enhanced by conditions that prevent or hinder the minus strand synthesis of a single plus strand segment. Recombination serves as a repair system as well as a means of changing the genetic structure of the virus. The reaction can be studied in an in-vitro packaging and replication system involving purified procapsids and ssRNA. Although there are striking differences in the mechanisms of recombination in RNA viruses, there are also strong similarities. All seem to use a copy-choice template switching action for recombination. The \u03A66 system is a useful model for the recombination of other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses such as the Reoviridae.","publish_time":"2005-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mindich, Leonard","journal":"Semin","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of recombination","\u03A66 system","segmented double-stranded RNA viruses","replication system","repair system","single plus strand segment","minus strand synthesis","unique segments of double","genome of bacteriophage \u03A66","purified procapsids","vitro packaging","useful model","regions","means","ssRNA","copy-choice template","conditions","genetic structure","little sequence similarity","striking differences","Reoviridae","crossover points","strong similarities","frequency of recombinants","identical nucleotides","reaction"],"language":"en"},

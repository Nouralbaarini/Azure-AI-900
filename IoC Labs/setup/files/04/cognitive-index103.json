The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite for all strategies aiming to contain the virus.

However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2, which alleviates the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples and the ability to detect as little as three viral genome equivalents is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuiper, J.

We aimed to investigate the disease status, concerns about management, and psychological stress in SAPHO patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. Method A structured questionnaire was distributed online to patients with SAPHO syndrome enrolled in a Chinese cohort study on March 3rd, 2020. Patients were ask about the current treatments, disease status, and concerns about disease management during the epidemic. Psychologic stress (scored from 0 to 10 points) and psychological problems were reported by the patients. Results A total of 157 patients (mean age 38.4 {\u002B/-} 12.3 years, 66.9% females) were included in the study. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Sixty-five (41.4%) patients worried about their disease conditions during the epidemic with concerns including medication shortage (73.8%), delay of consultation (46.2%), and disease aggravation (61.5%). Sixty-seven (42.7%) patients had medication withdrawal or dose reduction due to lack of drugs, irregular daily schedule or subjective reasons. The most common psychological problems reported was little interest or pleasure in doing things (66.2%).

The Legionella genome codes more than 300 effector proteins able to modulate host-pathogen interactions during infection. Among them are also enzymes altering the host-ubiquitination system including bacterial ligases and deubiquitinases. In this study, based on homology-detection screening on 305 Legionella effector proteins, we identified two Legionella OTU-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529), LotA (Lpg2248/Lem21) is already known). A crystal structure of LotC catalytic core (LotC14-310) was determined at 2.4 \u00C5 and compared with other OTU deubiquitinases, including LotB. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the structures of Legionella OTU-family (LotB and LotC) shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which define a novel class of OTU-deubiquitinase. Despite structural differences in their helical lobes, both LotB and LotC interact with ubiquitin. LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1\u2019) enabling specific cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of catalytically inactive LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-substrates for these two related DUBs. Together, our results provide new structural insights of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles of bacterial deubiquitinases in host-pathogen interactions.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Donghyuk; Bhattacharya, Anshu; Cheng, Yi-Lin; Alonso, Marta Campos; Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Ovaa, Huib; Hummer, Gerhard; Dikic, Ivan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1632e4e7b51e9401b93cdfd9bbdf300b78b8035c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.060954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structures of Legionella OTU-family","inactive LotB","new structural insights of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases","Legionella effector proteins","Legionella pneumophila","classical OTU-family","host-pathogen interactions","novel class of OTU","distinct roles of bacterial deubiquitinases","different categories of host","Legionella genome codes","different species of ubiquitin chains","bacterial ligases","host-ubiquitination system","S1 site","crystal structure of LotC catalytic core","additional ubiquitin binding site","linked poly-ubiquitin chains","effector proteins able","Cys-loop","helical lobes","variable loop","structural differences","extended helical lobe","gram-negative pathogenic bacterium","specific cleavage of Lys63","substrates","homology-detection screening","Ceg23","Lpg1621","Legionaries\u2019 disease","LotA","Lpg2529","LotC14","results","MS analysis","Lpg2248","enzymes","infection","related DUBs","Lem21","study","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Community-adquired respiratory viral infection is the most common cause of febrile infection in children, and an important cause of infection to consider in children with cancer. Nevertheless, there are few well-designed, controlled studies in this population, which makes it difficult to understand the importance, behaviour and management of these viruses in immunocompromised children. New diagnostic techniques in PCR-based microbiology, could provide many opportunities for early diagnosis, preventing the spread of the virus and to implement the correct therapy. It is important to design appropriate prospective studies to assess these types of infections in children with cancer. In this review we analyse the main studies published in the literature, evaluating the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of children with cancer and respiratory viral infection.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saavedra-Lozano, Jes\u00FAs; Garrido, Carmen; Catal\u00E1n, Pilar; Gonz\u00E1lez, Felipe","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc282aba7265e2890098d250fcbd4cc84afcc288.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X10003903; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X10003903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection in children","in PCR","preventing the spread of the virus and","in immunocompromised children","published in the literature","of infections in children with cancer","consider in children with cancer","diagnosis and management of children with cancer and respiratory viral infection","manejo de ni\u00F1os","evaluating the epidemiology","the most common","understand the importance","behaviour and management of these","ni\u00F1os inmunocomprometidos","c\u00E1ncer","implement the correct therapy","and an important","virus respiratorios adquirida","review we analyse the main","adquired respiratory viral infection","diagn\u00F3stico precoz","infecci\u00F3n febril","causa importante","estudios prospectivos","nuevas t\u00E9cnicas de diagn\u00F3stico","principales estudios publicados","assess these","it difficult","for early diagnosis","could provide many","based microbiology","microbiolog\u00EDa basadas","which","design appropriate prospective","m\u00FAltiples oportunidades","designed","controlled","population","few well","literatura","Abstract Community","comunidad","New diagnostic","tipo de infecciones","there","diseminaci\u00F3n","comportamiento","epidemiolog\u00EDa","cuenta","aplicaci\u00F3n de medidas terap\u00E9uticas correctas","Nevertheless","revisi\u00F3n","poblaci\u00F3n","importancia"],"language":"es"},

We analyze seven recent publications on the impact of BCG vaccinations on the development of COVID19 illness and extend presented findings using the latest data from April 10, 2020. We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID-19-related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID-19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country. Therefore, we show that there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that inclusion of BCG vaccination in national immunization program (NIP) has any impact of COVID 19 infections (cases) or mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shivendu, Shivendu; Chakraborty, Saurav; Onuchowska, Agnieszka; Srivastava, Arpit; Patidar, Ankita","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58dbc45845f27e33789d77bd2e9f9aa0dc18c519.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20071142v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inclusion of BCG vaccination","BCG vaccination inclusion","national immunization program","impact of COVID","dimension of COVID","relationship","dimension of testing","impact of BCG vaccinations","related testing","mandatory BCG policy","death incidences conditional","analyzed countries","country","attributable case","latest data","development of COVID19 illness","NIP","presented findings","caseload","assertion","infections","cases","recent publications","existing models","statistical evidence","mortality","paper","prior studies","disease pattern","goal","consideration"],"language":"en"},

Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for more than 100 years. Methods: Patients (n=25) with severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma obtained from donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had been symptom free for 14 days. The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 post-transfusion. Clinical improvement was assessed based on a modified World Health Organization 6-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters. Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains. Results: At baseline, all patients were receiving supportive care, including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral treatments, and all patients were on oxygen support. At day 7 post-transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged. By day 14 post-transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical status and 11 were discharged. No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed.

Conclusions: The data indicate that administration of convalescent plasma is a safe treatment option for those with severe COVID-19 disease.

Summary Background Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. With its high economic burden, it is considered a disease of major public health importance by the World Health Organization. The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this retrospective study in routine care was to evaluate our practices concerning microbiological prescriptions in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. Study design All children aged from 2 to 15years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation between January 2010 and December 2011 in our unit were included in the study. Microbiological prescriptions, their indications, their results, and their cost were studied. Results One hundred ninety-seven children were included in the study. A potential causative agent was sought in 79.7% of the children (n =157) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main indications were upper airway infections, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 23.8% of them (30/126). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by PCR in only 3.2% of these patients (4/125). No other bacterial agent was identified. There was no correlation between the severity of asthma exacerbation and the microbiological diagnosis of infection. The results did not influence the therapy given. These prescriptions represented a substantial cost for each child. Conclusion These analyses do not seem to have a real advantage for the patient except for epidemiology. It would be important to conduct a new study analyzing the role of rhinovirus, and of other viruses such as coronavirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus, not routinely investigated in our hospital, and to question the value of these costly microbiological tests.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauvaget, E.; Bresson, V.; Oudyi, M.; Bosdure, E.; Loundou, A.-D.; Chabrol, B.; Charrel, R.; Dubus, J.-C.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c8bed54ed240f5412d435914ec507b190f8bcd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X14003698; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X14003698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Une","Les","Aucune"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["r\u00E9sultats microbiologiques et","bocavirus et","children","severity of asthma exacerbation","et d\u00E9cembre","et analysant","co\u00FBt global avait \u00E9t\u00E9","acute exacerbation","microbiological prescriptions","virus avait \u00E9t\u00E9 identifi\u00E9 chez","enfants ont \u00E9t\u00E9 inclus","en charge m\u00E9dicale et leur co\u00FBt","PCR","new study","retrospective study","results","en charge th\u00E9rapeutique avait \u00E9t\u00E9 peu modifi\u00E9e par ces r\u00E9sultats","Une recherche d\u2019agent pathog\u00E8ne respiratoire avait \u00E9t\u00E9 r\u00E9alis\u00E9e chez","Mycoplasma pneumoniae avaient \u00E9t\u00E9 positives","pathog\u00E8nes respiratoires chez","une exacerbation d\u2019asthme dans notre unit\u00E9 entre janvier","leur rendement","enfants hospitalis\u00E9s","enfants pr\u00E9lev\u00E9s","exacerbations d\u2019asthme sont","microbiological diagnosis of infection","recherch\u00E9s en routine hospitali\u00E8re","plus souvent d\u00E9clench\u00E9es par une infection respiratoire","int\u00E9r\u00EAt mod\u00E9r\u00E9 en dehors","analyses par amplification g\u00E9nique","Aucune autre bact\u00E9rie n\u2019avait \u00E9t\u00E9 identifi\u00E9e","Conclusion D\u2019apr\u00E8s nos r\u00E9sultats","leurs indications","main indications","coronavirus","Summary Background Asthma","costly microbiological tests","Viruses","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction Chez l\u2019enfant","R\u00E9sultats Cent quatre-vingt","analyses bact\u00E9riologiques avaient eu","leur impact sur","surtout en cas d\u2019infection oto-rhino","Patients et m\u00E9thodes Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00E9tude r\u00E9trospective incluant tout enfant hospitalis\u00E9","pathog\u00E8nes respiratoires au cours","routine care","role of rhinovirus","substantial cost","bacterial agent","disease of major public health importance","World Health Organization","upper airway infections","respiratory tract infections","common chronic disease","potential causative agent","rendement faible puisque seulement","cette \u00E9tude \u00E9tait d\u2019\u00E9valuer l\u2019int\u00E9r\u00EAt","Aucun lien n\u2019a pu \u00EAtre \u00E9tabli entre","l\u2019identification","dix","laryngologique","l\u2019ent\u00E9rovirus","reste cependant \u00E0 pr\u00E9ciser","L\u2019objectif","hypoxemia","euros","gravit\u00E9","practices","IFA","d\u2019hypox\u00E9mie ou","link","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologique","l\u2019exacerbation","polymerase chain reaction","real advantage","epidemiology","pneumonie","immunofluorescence assay","childhood","aim","correlation","years","high economic burden","ans d\u2019\u00E9tude","L\u2019impact","enterovirus","long time","therapy"],"language":"en"},

The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations of these parameters to a few examples of different types of shifting influences acting on detection, depending on the likely sensitivity of surveillance systems to errors from sources such as clinical testing rates and differences in healthcare-seeking behavior from the public over time.

Electronic cigarette use (vaping) rapidly gained popularity in the US in recent years. Whether electronic cigarette users (vapers) are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection is unknown. Methods Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureau and the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of weighted proportions of vapers with number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in the US. Results The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 infected cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 infected cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554 - 0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3705 (95% CI: 0.0623 - 0.6786) in log scale in each US state.

Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020.

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2\u003E0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak.

In this study an evaluation of the awareness of rare diseases, alongside related information and educational resources available for patients, their families and healthcare professionals, was conducted in 2018-2019 using an online survey and semi-structured interviews with rare disease collaborative groups (charities, voluntary and community groups) active across Northern Ireland (NI). Results Ninety-nine participants engaged with the survey with 31 respondents providing detailed answers. Resources such as information, communication, registries, online services, training and improvements to support services were queried. Excellent communication is an important factor in delivering good rare disease support. Training for health professionals was also highlighted as an essential element of improving support for those with a rare disease to ensure they approach people with these unique and challenging diseases in an appropriate way. Carers were mentioned several times throughout the study; it is often felt they are overlooked in rare disease research and more support should be in place for them. Current care/support for those with a rare disease was highlighted as inadequate. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with rare disease collaborative groups. Reoccurring themes included a need for more effective: information and communication, training for health professionals, online presence, support for carers, and involvement in research. Conclusions All rare disease collaborative groups agreed that current services for people living and working with a rare disease are not adequate. An important finding to consider in future research within the rare disease field is the inclusion of carers perceptions and experiences in studies. Due to the unique role a carer has in the life of a person with a rare disease it is vital that their voice is heard and their needs are listened to. This research provides insight into the support available for rare diseases across Northern Ireland, highlights unmet needs in service provision, and suggests approaches to improve rare disease support prioritising improved information and communication provision, improved access to services, and tailored support for carers of people with a rare disease.

Between May and July 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease swept through the population. Initial microbiological investigations ruled out known equine viral agents as the cause of the infections, but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus as being frequently isolated from diseased animals. This diverse bacterial species has a broad host range and is usually regarded as a commensal of horses. By genome sequencing S. zooepidemicus recovered from horses during the epidemic we show that although multiple clones of S. zooepidemicus were present in the population, one particular clone, ST209, was responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 caused zoonotic infections, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this clone. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the original ST209 strain entered Iceland in late 2008 or early 2009. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into a training yard that utilized a submerged treadmill between the 5th and 19th of February 2010 was a critical trigger for the ensuing epidemic of disease, provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses, and subsequent distribution of these animals to multiple sites in Iceland.","publish_time":"2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bj\u00F6rnsd\u00F3ttir, Sigr\u00ED\u00F0ur; Harris, Simon R.; Svansson, Vilhj\u00E1lmur; Gunnarsson, Eggert; Sigur\u00F0ard\u00F3ttirr, \u00D3l\u00F6f G.; Gammeljord, Kristina; Steward, Karen F.; Newton, J.

We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simulations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by different mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jindal, Akshay; Rao, Shrisha","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/799602548eecfd7f988184c0384720852b8d0b8e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of lockdowns","outbreaks of mosquito","outbreaks of serious communicable diseases","decentralised strategies","number of cases","various intervention strategies","lockdown conditions","different mosquito","lockdown measures","number of infected people","indoor residual spraying","insecticide-treated nets","simulations","day-biting mosquitoes","agent-based model","COVID","risk","severity","world\u0027s population","restrictions","countries","scale","increase","impact","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 1,659 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 42% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million infections across these six countries. These findings may help inform whether or when these ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the other 180\u002B countries where COVID-19 has been reported.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsiang, Solomon; Allen, Daniel; Annan-Phan, Sebastien; Bell, Kendon; Bolliger, Ian; Chong, Trinetta; Druckenmiller, Hannah; Hultgren, Andrew; Huang, Luna Yue; Krasovich, Emma; Lau, Peiley; Lee, Jaecheol; Rolf, Esther; Tseng, Jeanette; Wu, Tiffany","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1df9298d590e4d3b6395ced26591a01164a14c3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040642","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","South Korea","Iran","France","United States"],"keyphrases":["effect of policies","ongoing policies","similar policies","unprecedented policies","current policies","national anti-contagion policies","growth rate of infections","form of infections","economic growth","early infections of COVID","different populations","exhibit exponential growth rates","ongoing pandemic","policy actions","countries","different impacts","policy packages","reduced-form econometric methods","South Korea","China","France","Italy","Iran","homes","localities","consistent evidence","significant effects","visible costs","measurable health outcomes","United States","novel coronavirus","world","new data","society","schools","process-based simulations","absence","contrast","benefits","date","results","Governments","day","decision-making","order","findings"],"language":"en"},

In preliminary reports it was suggested to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods In this open-label prospective study we describe clinical characteristics and outcome of 51 patients hospitalized with confirmed and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab intravenously. All patients had elevated IL-6 plasma level (\u003E40 pg/mL) and oxygen saturation \u003C93% in ambient air. Clinical outcomes, oxygen support, laboratory data and adverse events were collected over a follow-up of 30 days. Results Forty-five patients (88%) were on high-flow oxygen supplementation, six of whom with invasive ventilation. From baseline to day 7 after tocilizumab we observed a dramatic drop of body temperature and CRP value with a significant increase in lymphocyte count (p\u003C0.001). Over a median follow-up time of 34 days from tocilizumab, 34 patients (67%) showed an improvement in their clinical severity class; 31 were discharged; 17 (33%) showed a worsening of their clinical status, of these 14 died (27%). The mortality rate was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation at baseline (83.3% vs 20% of patients on non-invasive oxygen support; p=0.0001). The most frequent side effects were an increase of hepatic enzymes (29%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and serious bacterial and fungal infections (27%). Conclusion Tocilizumab exerts a rapidly beneficial effect on fever and inflammatory markers, although no significant impact on the clinical outcome can be inferred by our results. Critically ill patients seem to have a high risk of serious infections with this drug.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morena, Valentina; Milazzo, Laura; Oreni, Letizia; Bestetti, Giovanna; Fossali, Tommaso; Bassoli, Cinzia; Torre, Alessandro; Cossu, Maria Vittoria; Minari, Caterina; Ballone, Elisabetta; Perotti, Andrea; Mileto, Davide; Niero, Fosca; Merli, Stefania; Foschi, Antonella; Vimercati, Stefania; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Sollima, Salvatore; Bradanini, Lucia; Galimberti, Laura; Colombo, Riccardo; Micheli, Valeria; Negri, Cristina; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa; Meroni, Luca; Galli, Massimo; Antinori, Spinello; Corbellino, Mario","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c440e8c26b3ac93afebd2c73d7d023abcdfa944d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520301965; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520301965","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","clinical characteristics","Clinical outcomes","Conclusion Tocilizumab","clinical status","oxygen saturation","non-invasive oxygen support","Abstract Background Tocilizumab","clinical severity class","significant increase","targets IL","pro-inflammatory effects of IL","elevated IL","high-flow oxygen supplementation","severe COVID","days","baseline","Results","high risk of serious infections","significant impact","inflammatory markers","beneficial effect","fungal infections","mechanical ventilation","invasive ventilation","increase of hepatic enzymes","median follow-up time","CRP value","humanized monoclonal antibody","laboratory data","receptors","dramatic drop of body temperature","open-label prospective study","adverse events","plasma level","lymphocyte count","pg","fever","pneumonia","vs","Methods","drug","improvement","mortality rate","ambient air","worsening","preliminary reports","thrombocytopenia"],"language":"en"},

Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient\u0027s prognosis was followed up. Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789, P\u003C0.001). Conclusion: Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fei, Jun; Fu, Lin; Li, Ying; Xiang, Hui-Xian; Xiang, Ying; Li, Meng-Die; Liu, Fang-Fang; Xu, De-xiang; Zhao, Hui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/697ed1b5ce6fda0e877550967f762bd6f29d00b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050955","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBIL","AST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","younger patients","Older COVID","prognosis of COVID","reduction of lymphocytes","risk factor of lymphocyte reduction","clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction","normal lymphocyte","year-old patients","death risk of COVID","admission","respiratory function markers","early stage","objective","markers of hepatic injury","chest CT score","clinical characteristics","older age","percentage of lymphocytes","Patient\u0027s prognosis","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","indices of renal function","chest computed tomography","induced coronavirus disease","key marker of lung injury","demographic data","urea nitrogen","oxygenation index","severity of multiple organ injuries","comorbidities","creatinine","creatine kinase","LDH","SpO2","association","Biochemical indexes","Electronic medical records","PaCO2","Multivariate logistic regression","exposure history","DBIL","SARS-CoV","Background","myocardial enzymes","contrast","count","RR","Fatality rate","Conclusion","TBIL","study","Methods","reports","Results","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Ying hui; Meng, Si jun; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Shui sheng; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Ya wei; Ye, Yi xiang; Wei, Qi feng; Zhao, Nian gui; Jiang, Jian ping; Ji, Xiao ying; Zhou, Chun xia; Zheng, Chao; Zhang, Wen; Xie, Li zhong; Hu, Yong chao; He, Jian quan; Chen, Jian; Wang, Wang yue; Zhang, Chang hua; Cao, Liming; Xu, Wen; Lei, Yunhong; Jian, Zheng hua; Hu, Wei ping; Qin, Wen juan; Wang, Wan yu; He, Yu long; Xiao, Hang; Zheng, Xiao fang; Hu, Yi Qun; Pan, Wen Sheng; Cai, Jian feng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18f991e0b4dc599435b56f7938e37c1489633daa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051060","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lung"],"organizations":["Signal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory sounds of patients","respiratory sounds of COVID","abnormal breathing sounds","common abnormal respiratory sounds","common abnormal breath sounds","suspected patients","severe patients","asymptomatic suspicious patients","physicians","lack of clinical data","asymptomatic patient","Signal analysis","effective screening method","simple screening method","asymmetrical vocal resonance","positive results of nucleic acid","retrospective case series study","Lung auscultation","indistinguishable murmurs","hand-held portable electronic stethoscope","real time","infected pneumonia","invaluable information","correspondence","admission","credibility","radiographic computed tomography","Cackles","physiology","pathology","Bluetooth","development","novel coronavirus","continuous outbreaks","combination","Conclusions","medical resources","Background","world","Methods","main organ","recorded audio"],"language":"en"},

As of April 10, 2020 half COVID-19 deaths in Canada had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario. Methods: We analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC were calculated with community living Ontarians aged \u003E 69 used as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC resident death. Results: Confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272/627 LTC by April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was 87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag).

Summary Aim The French population is facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the health system have been reoriented in emergency for the care of patients with coronavirus. The management of cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted to this context. Material and method An expert opinion documented by a literature review was formulated by the Cancerology Committee of the French Association of Urology (CCAFU). Results The medical and surgical management of patients with any cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted by modifying the consultation methods, by prioritizing interventions according to the intrinsic prognosis of cancers, taking into account the patient\u0027s comorbidities. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 must be considered. Conclusion The CCAFU issues an expert opinion on the measure to be taken to adapt the management of cancers of the male urinary and genital tract to the context of pandemic by COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9jean, A.; Roupr\u00EAt, M.; Rozet, F.; Bensalah, K.; Murez, T.; Game, X.; Rebillard, X.; Mallet, R.; Faix, A.; Mongiat-Artus, P.; Fournier, G.; Neuzillet, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60c98f70b0bad292b0157d0e3366762e93e3e16a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1166708720301020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1166708720301020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCAFU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the urinary","The protection","the care","the health","the male urinary","the Cancerology Committee","Summary Aim The","Results The medical","the measure to be taken to adapt the management","genital tract to the context","charge des cancers","population is facing the COVID","modifying the consultation methods","prise","Conclusion The CCAFU issues an expert opinion","prioritizing interventions according to the intrinsic prognosis","taking into account the patient\u0027s comorbidities","patients with any cancers","charge des patients atteints","appareil urinaire","male genital tracts must be adapted to this context","must be considered","patients with coronavirus","urologists from COVID","charge m\u00E9dicale","surgical management","pandemic","population fran\u00E7aise","Association Fran\u00E7aise","avis","contexte de pand\u00E9mie","method An expert opinion documented","protection des urologues vis","modalit\u00E9s de consultation","experts document\u00E9","literature review was formulated","reoriented in emergency","Comit\u00E9 de Canc\u00E9rologie","Material","revue de la litt\u00E9rature","m\u00E9thode","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objectif","fonction du pronostic intrins\u00E8que","Urologie","urgence","Urology","syst\u00E8me de sant\u00E9","Mat\u00E9riel","mesures","R\u00E9sultats","comorbidit\u00E9s du patient","consid\u00E9ration"],"language":"fr"},

However, their development in infected patients remain unknown. Here, we report on the dynamic development of a potent and protective ZIKV-specific human antibody ZK2B10 initially isolated from a ZIKV convalescent individual using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The unbiased repertoire analysis showed dramatic changes in many families of heavy and light chain variable regions. However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic hypermutation throughout the 12 months since the onset of symptom. In particular, NGS-derived germline-like somatic variants neutralized and protected mice from lethal challenge of ZIKV without detectable cross-reactivity with Dengue virus (DENV). Site-directed mutagenesis identified two residues within \u03BB chain, N31 and S91 that are essential to the functional maturation. The dynamic features unveiled here will assist us to better understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and inform rational design of vaccines. Author summary Recently emerged ZIKV is associated with severe neurological complications such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome in adults and congenital microcephaly in newborns. No ZIKV-specific therapeutics or vaccines are currently available. We and others have identified a number of neutralizing antibodies capable of protecting experimental animals from ZIKV infection. However, the development of these potent antibodies during ZIKV natural infection remains unknown. Here, we report on the longitudinal analysis of one such antibody ZK2B10 using next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics and functional analysis. We found that the ZK2B10 germline-like antibodies possess strong neutralizing activity in vitro and impressive protectivity against lethal ZIKV infection in vivo. These findings suggest that the potent and protective antibody response against ZIKV can be generated within relative short term with high germline identity which provide great hope and promise for successful vaccine development against ZIKV.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Fei; Lin, Xiaohe; He, Linling; Wang, Ruoke; Wang, Han; Shi, Xuanling; Zhang, Fuchun; Yin, Chibiao; Zhang, Linqi; Zhu, Jiang; Yu, Lei","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d05684da9bd654a6ae90f72b1049661636d3192d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/661918","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerged ZIKV","lethal ZIKV infection","ZIKV natural infection","pathogenesis of ZIKV infection","ZIKV-specific therapeutics","lethal challenge of ZIKV","ZIKV convalescent individual","protective ZIKV-specific human antibody ZK2B10","potent antibodies","ZK2B10 germline","specific neutralizing antibodies","dynamic development","functional analysis","protective antibody response","NGS-derived germline","successful vaccine development","number of neutralizing antibodies capable","antibody-based interventions","vaccine design","lineage tracing of ZK2B10","great promise","generation sequencing","longitudinal analysis","strong neutralizing activity","high germline identity","rational design of vaccines","unbiased repertoire analysis","great hope","somatic variants","\u03BB chain","Dengue virus","Zika virus","functional maturation","dynamic features","limited somatic hypermutation","light chain variable regions","families of heavy","impressive protectivity","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","detectable cross-reactivity","adults","Guillain","dramatic changes","protected mice","experimental animals","severe neurological complications","relative short term","congenital microcephaly","residues","months","N31","S91","bioinformatics","mutagenesis","newborns","DENV","Author summary","infected patients","onset of symptom","Site","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karalis, Vangelis; Ismailos, George; Karatza, Eleni","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/113af91a0065f818a85d7bb33c4983432bf12d5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520302393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302393?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chloroquine treatment","chloroquine dosing","adverse events of chloroquine","case of chloroquine overdosing","dosing regimens","Co-administration of chloroquine","observed serious adverse events","treatment of COVID","severe adverse effects","risk of QT prolongation","specific medicinal treatment","safety information","optimized dosage regimens","cardiomyopathy","study","safer alternative dosage regimens","new SARS-CoV2","high risk","QT interval","dose reduction","associated COVID","elder patients","safety concerns","lack of essential information","pulmonary oedema","relationships","maximum tolerated doses","respiratory insufficiency","conditions similar","drugs","recommendations","circulatory collapse","critical appraisal","simulation techniques","concentration levels","toxicity","simulations","evolution","azithromycin","risks","pneumonia","length of hospital","aim"],"language":"en"},

With only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities, India - a democracy of 1.34 billion people - took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed. Objective: To study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 cases in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock-down phase of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID-19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia. Main Outcome and Measures: The current time-series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates time-varying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI). Results: Our predicted cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1-week delay in people\u0027s adherence to a 21-day lockdown (March 25 - April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under \u0022no intervention\u0022 and \u0022social distancing and travel bans without lockdown\u0022 are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID-19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. We find some suggestive evidence that the COVID-19 incidence rates worldwide are negatively associated with temperature in a crude unadjusted analysis with Pearson correlation estimates [95% confidence interval] between average monthly temperature and total monthly incidence around the world being -0.185 [-0.548, 0.236] for January, -0.110 [-0.362, 0.157] for February, and -0.173 [-0.314, -0.026] for March. Conclusions and Relevance: The lockdown, if implemented correctly in the end, has a high chance of reducing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for the best outcome. We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself. Data can play a defining role as we design post-lockdown testing, reopening and resource allocation strategies. Software: Our contribution to data science includes an interactive and dynamic app (covind19.org) with short- and long-term projections updated daily that can help inform policy and practice related to COVID-19 in India.

It has a highly constant frequency with harmonics and little variation in amplitude and wave shape. In contrast to stochastic noise it is phasic, i.e., the phase relation remains constant across long intervals. In digital recordings, the measurement frequency is typically very close to a multiple of the hum frequency (50 or 60 Hz). Common filters introduce various kinds of distortions and errors. The here proposed subtraction method makes use of the specific properties of power line hum. For this, it computes a moving estimate of the hum noise by taking the periodic median of the high-pass filtered signal. The resulting periodic median subtraction (PMS) filter reliably removes hum of any harmonic composition, even if the ground frequency is lacking. The filter is completely free of border artifacts. It does not introduce distortions, even if around sharp transients such as in force plate recordings of jumping. The filter is validated on recorded and artificial data. The errors are quantified. The results also show that the errors of hum filters generally increase with the high-frequency content of the data. Thus, the removal of hum from a force plate recording generally gives better results than from an EMG recoding. Compared to other filters, the errors of the PMS filter are generally lower than the best hum filters currently known.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Lussanet de la Sabloni\u00E8re, Marc H.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings: From January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

Examination of the bPIV3 mRNAs, however, indicates that site b is non-functional whereas site a operates frequently. Insertions at site a give rise to both V and D protein mRNAs, because a very broad distribution of Gs is added when insertions occur. This broad distribution is very different from the editing sites of Sendai virus or SV5, where predominantly one form of edited mRNA containing either a one or two G insertion respectively is created, to access the single overlapping ORF of these viruses. A model is proposed to explain how paramyxoviruses control the range of G insertions on that fraction of the mRNAs where insertions occur. The bPIV3 P gene is unique as far as we know, in that a sizeable portion of the gene expresses all 3 reading frames as protein. bPIV3 apparently does this from a single editing site by removing the constraints which control the number of slippage rounds which take place.","publish_time":"1991-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelet, T; Curran, J; Kolakofsky, D","journal":"EMBO J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9ca0399cc67f3b4da5e6dc55fc3d3889c983941.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC452665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["site b","single editing site","bPIV3 mRNAs","V protein","bPIV3 P gene","D protein mRNAs","editing sites of Sendai virus","range of G insertions","paramyxoviruses","P gene of bovine parainfluenza virus","broad distribution of Gs","single overlapping ORF","form of edited mRNA","SV5","constraints","fraction","rise","number of slippage rounds","place","comparison","sizeable portion","frames","ORFs","Examination","model"],"language":"en"},

Choppin, 1985, J. Cell Biol. 101:1578-1590) described the lipid composition of a series of mouse fibroblast cell lines which vary in susceptibility to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two alterations in lipid content were found to be directly correlated with resistance to PEG-induced cell fusion: increases in fatty acyl chain saturation, and the elevation of neutral glycerides, including an unusual ether-linked compound. In this study, we have probed the association between lipid composition and cell fusion through the use of fatty acid supplements to the cellular growth medium, and show that the fusibility of cells can be controlled by altering their acyl chain composition. The parental Clone 1D cells contain moderately unsaturated fatty acids with a ratio of saturates to polyunsaturates (S/P) approximately 1 and fuse virtually to completion following a standard PEG treatment. By contrast, the lipids of a highly fusion-resistant mutant cell line, F40, are highly saturated (S/P approximately 4). When the S/P ratio of Clone 1D cells was increased to approximate that normally found in F40 cells by growth in the presence of high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, they became highly resistant to PEG. Reduction of the S/P ratio of F40 cells by growth in cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids rendered them susceptible to fusion. Cell lines F8, F16, etc., which are normally intermediate between Clone 1D and F40 in both lipid composition and fusion response, can be altered in either direction (towards either increased or decreased susceptibility to fusion) by the addition of appropriate fatty acids to the growth medium. Although trans-unsaturated fatty acids have phase-transition temperatures roughly similar to saturated compounds, and might therefore be expected to affect membrane fluidity in a similar manner, trans-unsaturated fatty acids exerted the same effect as cis-unsaturates on the control of PEG-induced cell fusion. This observation suggests that the control of cell fusion by alteration of fatty acid content is not due to changes in membrane fluidity, and thus that the fatty acids are involved in some other way in the modulation of cell fusion.","publish_time":"1985-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f4348a9455035db6487252e4fb48c65708a1e1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2113917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["J.

In contrast, PBM from A/J mice, a strain fully resistant to MHV-3, generate no increase in PCA above control levels. The induction phase of MHV-3 PCA is rapid, with an increase within 1-1.5 h, with maximum activity at 18h, and it precedes MHV-3 replication in either 17 CL1 cells, a fully permissive cell line, or in monocytes from these strains of mice.

Kinetics of histological disease manifestations, increases of liver enzyme levels in the serum, and cytotoxic T cell activities in livers and spleens all correlated and were dependent upon several parameters: LCMV-isolate; LCMV-WE caused extensive hepatitis, LCMV-Armstrong virtually none. Virus dose. Route of infection; i.v. or i.p. infection caused hepatitis, whereas infection into the footpad did not. The general genetic background of the murine host; of the strains tested, Swiss mice and A-strain mice were more susceptible than C57BL or CBA mice; BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were least susceptible. The degree of immunocompetence of the murine host; T cell deficient nu/nu mice never developed hepatitis, whereas nu/\u002B or \u002B/\u002B mice always did. B cell-depleted anti-IgM-treated mice developed immune-mediated hepatitis comparably or even more extensively than control mice. Local cytotoxic T cell activity; mononuclear cells isolated from livers during the period of overt hepatitis were two to five times more active than equal numbers of spleen cells. Adoptive transfer of nylon wool-nonadherent anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-Lyt-2 plus C- sensitive, anti-L3T4 plus C-resistant lymphocytes into irradiated mice preinfected with LCMV-WE caused a rapid time- and dose-dependent linear increase of serum enzyme levels. This increase was caused by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes if immune cell donors and recipient mice shared class I, but not when they shared class II histocompatibility antigens. The donor cell dose-dependent increase of these enzymes was first measurable 6-18 h after transfer with 2 X 10(8) cells or 3 X 10(6) cells, respectively. The time-dependent increase caused by the adoptive transfer of 1-2 X 10(8) cells was strictly linear during a period of up to 25-40 h. These results indicate single-hit kinetics of liver cell death and suggest that effector T cells destroy infected liver cells via direct contact rather than via soluble toxic mediators.

They are widely used as models of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which immune mechanisms are thought to participate in the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of MHV infection on target cell functions in the CNS are not well understood, but A59 has been shown to induce the expression of MHC class I molecules in glial cells after in vivo and in vitro infection. Changes in class I expression in infected cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of MHV infection in the CNS. In this communication, a large panel of MHV strains was tested for their ability to stimulate class I expression in primary astrocytes in vitro. The data show that the more hepatotropic strains, such as MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-NuU, were potent inducers of class I expression in astrocytes during acute infection, measured by radioimmunoassay. The Kb molecule was preferentially expressed over Db. By contrast, JHMV and several viral strains derived from it did not stimulate the expression of class I molecules. Assays of virus infectivity indicated that the class I-inducing activity did not correlate with the ability of the individual viral strain to replicate in astrocytes. However, exposure of the viruses or the supernatants from infected astrocytes to ultraviolet light abolished the class I-inducing activity, indicating that infectious virus is required for class I expression. These data also suggest that class I expression was induced directly by virus infection, and not by the secretion of a soluble substance into the medium by infected astrocytes. Finally, analyses of A59/JHMV recombinant viral strains suggest that class I-inducing activity resides in one of the A59 structural genes.","publish_time":"1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa51356108ada576b1b3a23b26c006b4e8d6cd4a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2191627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHC","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-A59","expression of class","MHV-NuU","MHV-D","immunopathogenesis of MHV infection","effects of MHV infection","expression of MHC class","large panel of MHV strains","infected astrocytes","potent inducers of class","virus infection","hepatotropic strains","acute infection","analyses of A59","JHMV recombinant viral strains","primary astrocytes","CNS","activity","susceptible strains of mice","A59 structural genes","infected cells","Neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis viruses","ability","molecules","infectious virus","data","individual viral strain","Assays of virus infectivity","cause acute","glial cells","demyelination","chronic encephalomyelitis","supernatants","target cell functions","multiple sclerosis","models of human demyelinating diseases","ultraviolet light","central nervous system","soluble substance","medium","development of lesions","secretion","rats","communication","contrast","Changes","immune mechanisms","exposure","radioimmunoassay"],"language":"en"},

We have isolated overlapping clones from a murine cDNA library encoding the full length alpha-mannosidase II open reading frame and most of the 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 untranslated region. The coding sequence predicts a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail (five amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (21 amino acids), and a large COOH-terminal catalytic domain (1,124 amino acids). This domain organization which is shared with the Golgi glycosyl-transferases suggests that the common structural motifs may have a functional role in Golgi enzyme function or localization. Three sets of polyadenylated clones were isolated extending 3\u0027 beyond the open reading frame by as much as 2,543 bp. Northern blots suggest that these polyadenylated clones totaling 6.1 kb in length correspond to minor message species smaller than the full length message. The largest and predominant message on Northern blots (7.5 kb) presumably extends another approximately 1.4-kb downstream beyond the longest of the isolated clones. Transient expression of the alpha-mannosidase II cDNA in COS cells resulted in 8-12-fold overexpression of enzyme activity, and the appearance of cross-reactive material in a perinuclear membrane array consistent with a Golgi localization. A region within the catalytic domain of the alpha-mannosidase II open reading frame bears a strong similarity to a corresponding sequence in the rat liver endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase and the vacuolar alpha- mannosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Existing evidence suggests that the E1 protein subunit carries the fusion potential of the heterodimer, whereas the E2 subunit, or its intracellular precursor p62, is required for binding to the nucleocapsid. We show here that during virus uptake into acidic endosomes the original E2E1 heterodimer is destabilized and the E1 proteins form new oligomers, presumably homooligomers, with altered E1 structure. This altered structure of E1 is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody which can also inhibit penetration of SFV into host cells as well as SFV-mediated cell-cell fusion, thus suggesting that the altered E1 structure is important for the membrane fusion.

Both ribophorins appear to be part of the translocation apparatus for nascent polypeptides that is associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and participate in the formation of a proteinaceous network within the ER membrane that also includes other components of the translocation apparatus. The ribophorins are both highly stable proteins that lack O- linked sugars but each contains one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide that remains endo H sensitive throughout their lifetimes. We have previously shown (Tsao, Y. S., N. E. Ivessa, M. Adesnik, D. D. Sabatini, and G. Kreibich. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 116:57- 67) that a COOH-terminally truncated variant of ribophorin I that contains only the first 332 amino acids of the luminal domain (RI332), when synthesized in permanent transformants of HeLa cells, undergoes a rapid degradation with biphasic kinetics in the ER itself and in a second, as yet unidentified nonlysosomal pre-Golgi compartment. We now show that in cells treated with brefeldin A (BFA) RI332 molecules undergo rapid O-glycosylation in a multistep process that involves the sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and terminal sialic acid residues. Addition of O-linked sugars affected all newly synthesized RI332 molecules and was completed soon after synthesis with a half time of about 10 min. In the same cells, intact ribophorins I and II also underwent O-linked glycosylation in the presence of BFA, but these molecules were modified only during a short time period immediately after their synthesis was completed, and the modification affected only a fraction of the newly synthesized polypeptides. More important, these molecules synthesized before the addition of BFA were not modified by O-glycosylation. The same is true for ribophorin I when overexpressed in HeLa cells although it is significantly less stable than the native polypeptide in control cells. We, therefore, conclude that soon after their synthesis, ribophorins lose their susceptibility to the relocated Golgi enzymes that effect the O-glycosylation, most likely as a consequence of a conformational change in the ribophorins that occurs during their maturation, although it cannot be excluded that rapid integration of these molecules into a supramolecular complex in the ER membrane leads to their inaccessibility to these enzymes.","publish_time":"1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3041dc5ba951755241ae7e75ade271188033d4de.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Y.

In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent- dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (Kd = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response.","publish_time":"1992-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/006be99e337c84b8758591a54f0362353b24dfde.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against HIV. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, PEG (polyethylene glycol), CdCl(2), cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. PEG at 1% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4-fold after 24 h of exposure, whereas 200 \u00B5g mL(\u22121) cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7 days of treatment. Mannan at 10 mg L(\u22121) concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10 days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, SOD activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress.

Data on the effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. Objectives To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study Desigh Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20 and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Results The median gestational age on admission was 38\u002B0 (IQR 36\u002B0-39\u002B1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. There were eight cases (6.9%, 8/116) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of eight patients (1/8) that presented in the first- and early-second-trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Twenty-one of 99 patients (21.2%, 21/99) that had delivered had preterm birth, including six with preterm premature ruptured of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks was 6.1% (6/99). There was one case of severe neonatal asphyxia that resulted in neonatal death. Eighty-six of the 100 neonates that had testing for SARS-CoV-2 had negative results, of these ten neonates had paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples that were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the infection manifests during the third-trimester of pregnancy.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Jie; Guo, Juanjuan; Fan, Cuifang; Juan, Juan; Yu, Xuechen; Li, Jiafu; Feng, Ling; Li, Chunyan; Chen, Huijun; Qiao, Yuan; Lei, Di; Wang, Chen; Xiong, Guoping; Xiao, Fengyi; He, Wencong; Pang, Qiumei; Hu, Xiaoling; Wang, Suqing; Chen, Dunjin; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Poon, Liona C.; Yang, Huixia","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61c1d770ba265b60419acbdfe8dd25ceb2ec122f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335053/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820304622; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820304622?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Desigh Clinical"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Conclusions SARS-CoV","evidence of vertical transmission of SARS","vertical transmission potential of SARS","rate of spontaneous preterm birth","trimester of pregnancy","patients","severe pneumonia","infection manifests","missed spontaneous abortion","case of severe neonatal asphyxia","cord blood samples","amniotic fluid","increased risk of spontaneous abortion","neonatal death","neonates","effect of COVID","negative results","testing","weeks","cases","neonatal pharyngeal swab samples","preterm premature ruptured of membranes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronavirus disease","clinical characteristics","common symptoms","small case series","Study Desigh Clinical records","outcomes","admission","Abstract Background","pregnant women","global public health emergency","median gestational age","hospitals","maternal deaths","Abnormal radiologic findings","fever","China","Objectives","Data","IQR","Eighty-six","cough"],"language":"en"},

Fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis II, a disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB, are refractory to EBOV, whereas cells from their healthy parents support infection. Impaired infection correlates with loss of the expression of cathepsin B, known to be essential for EBOV entry. GNPTAB activity is dependent upon proteolytic cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P protease. Inhibiting this protease with the small-molecule PF-429242 blocks EBOV entry and infection. Disruption of GNPTAB function may represent a strategy for a host-targeted therapy for EBOV.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flint, Mike; Chatterjee, Payel; Lin, David L.; McMullan, Laura K.; Shrivastava-Ranjan, Punya; Bergeron, \u00C9ric; Lo, Michael K.; Welch, Stephen R.; Nichol, Stuart T.; Tai, Andrew W.; Spiropoulou, Christina F.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec432ab2fea7d620db7138b7c72ceecf03f09785.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b5e5be4a7ee27bb1faa29832b5b20c36a903433a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6336797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655525/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08135-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV infection","GNPTAB activity","Ebola virus infection","blocks EBOV entry","Impaired infection correlates","reconstituting GNPTAB expression","Disruption of GNPTAB function","GNPTAB knockout cell line","genes essential","S1P protease","expression of cathepsin B","screen","loss","small-molecule PF","acetylglucosamine","SKI","strategy","proteolytic cleavage","cells","\u03B2 subunits of N","disorder","host-targeted therapy","approved therapies","healthy parents","patients","mucolipidosis","mutations","potential therapeutic targets","phosphate transferase","Fibroblasts"],"language":"en"},

Evolutionary biologists have a role in building a bridge between the disciplines by presenting evolutionary biology in the context of human health and medical practice to undergraduates, including premedical and preprofessional students. We suggest that students will find medical examples of evolution engaging. By making the connections between evolution and medicine clear at the undergraduate level, the stage is set for future health providers and biomedical scientists to work productively in this synthetic area. Here, we frame key evolutionary concepts in terms of human health, so that biomedical examples may be more easily incorporated into evolution courses or more specialized courses on evolutionary medicine.

Recently, it was demonstrated that initiation of protein 3c is dependent on the upstream sequence. Monte Carlo simulations of RNA folding in this tricistronic mRNA3 indicate that a highly significant folding region occurs prior to the initiator AUG of 3c. The unusual folding region (UFR) of 265 nucleotides (nt) contains the coding sequences of proteins 3a and 3b. Details of the structural analyses show that five highly significant RNA stem-loops in the UFR can be modeled into a compact superstructure by the interaction of two predicted pseudoknot structures. The folded superstructure comprising nt 44 to 330, with additional 22 nt downstream from this UFR, is suggested to serve as a ribosome landing pad (or an internal ribosomal entry site) in the cap-independent translation of the 3c of IBV. Intriguingly, the proposed structural motif of this coronavirus shares structural features similar to those proposed in a number of picornavirus mRNAs. Based on the common structural features, a plausible base pairing model between mRNA3 and 18 S rRNA is suggested, which is consistent with a general mechanism for regulation of internal initiation described in many picornaviruses.","publish_time":"1994-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le, Shu-Yun; Sonenberg, Nahum; Maizel, Jacob V.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284710518; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284710518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UFR","structural analyses","c of IBV","structural features similar","common structural features","proposed structural motif","significant folding region","tricistronic mRNA3","unusual folding region","regulation of internal initiation","significant RNA stem-loops","initiation of protein","small proteins","compact superstructure","folded superstructure","coding sequences of proteins","internal ribosomal entry site","Monte Carlo simulations of RNA","plausible base pairing model","coronavirus","interaction","general mechanism","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","cap-independent translation","ribosome landing pad","S rRNA","nucleotides","predicted pseudoknot structures","upstream sequence","initiator","number of picornavirus mRNAs","Details","picornaviruses"],"language":"en"},

In less than two months, the disease had spread to more than 200 herds in thirteen states. Experts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) engaged in laboratory diagnostics, analytic support, epidemiology expertise, and data management to facilitate the effort. By 2014, a great deal had been learned about the disease; however, the question of how it entered the United States remained unanswered. In 2014, USDA formed an investigative group to address the question and leverage current knowledge with resources and partnerships not readily available to non-federal investigators. The group formed collaborations with other government and non-government organizations and individuals, and followed many avenues of inquiry; ultimately arriving at a small number of scenarios that describe possible mechanisms for PED introduction. For a scenario to be plausible, it had to explain: contamination of a person or product in the source country, its transit and entry to the United States, rapid dispersal across a wide geographic area, and exposure/infection of pigs. It had to be compatible with findings of swine herd investigations and research studies. Potential products had to have been imported legally during the time prior to the beginning of the epidemic, or delivered to the United States through prohibited channels. Follow-up studies were initiated to gather more evidence for the most plausible scenarios. Of the scenarios, flexible intermediate bulk containers (\u201Cfeed totes\u201D) used to transport bulk feed serving as fomites for movement of PED virus provided the simplest explanation for the accumulated findings of the investigation.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Aaron; McCluskey, Brian; Brown-Reid, Monica; Grear, Dan; Pitcher, Paul; Ramos, Greg; Spencer, Denise; Singrey, Aaron","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acf00d784442e1565de532f1f2c92cd3bdc3a7ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114364.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711302/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300829; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.11.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300829","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USDA"],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["United States","plausible scenarios","bulk feed","PED introduction","USDA","question","emerging disease","movement of PED virus","small number of scenarios","findings of swine herd investigations","accumulated findings","feed totes","research studies","swine industry","investigative group","Follow-up studies","non-government organizations","flexible intermediate bulk containers","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","epidemiology expertise","rapid dispersal","partnerships","wide geographic area","laboratory diagnostics","entry","analytic support","simplest explanation","possible mechanisms","exposure","source country","resources","individuals","fomites","transit","data management","US Department of Agriculture","person","current knowledge","collaborations","non-federal investigators","Experts","infection of pigs","parts","evidence","spring","prohibited channels","avenues of inquiry","professionals","contamination","effort","time","beginning","great deal","Potential products","months","herds"],"language":"en"},

A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed.

METHODS: This retrospective observation study is comprised of seven patients who presented with MEWDS in a 3-month period in central Israel. Data were collected from patients\u0027 medical records on clinical, multimodal imaging, and viral serology findings. RESULTS: Six women and one man of mean age 31.5 \u00B1 7.2 years. Three reported a precedent viral infection. All had unilateral decreased vision. Funduscopy revealed foveal granularity. MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS: Hyperfluorescent spots on blue autofluorescence (BAF), hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green angiography, dark lesions on infrared photos, and ellipsoid zone irregularities on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Resolution of the spots on BAF correlated with anatomic (SD-OCT) and visual recovery. OCT angiography performed following the convalescence stage demonstrated intact retinal and choroidal flow. Serologic findings were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: We report a unique cluster of MEWDS patients presented in a short period of time. SD-OCT findings of ellipsoid zone disruption in combination with other multimodal imaging modalities are outlined meticulously. Recognizing these imaging features along with high index of clinical suspicion is important for the diagnosis of MEWDS. Serologic testing might be considered in future patients.","publish_time":"2017-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gal-Or, Orly; Priel, Ethan; Rosenblatt, Irit; Shulman, Shiri; Kramer, Michal","journal":"J Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee3cc22161595e877450737882a52950fd179672.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5444036.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/7535320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28584665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Funduscopy"],"organizations":["MEWDS","BAF","Serologic"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS","SD","Serologic findings","imaging features","unique cluster of MEWDS patients","diagnosis of MEWDS","month period","multimodal imaging modalities","viral serology findings","findings of ellipsoid zone disruption","hypofluorescent spots","Hyperfluorescent spots","BAF","future patients","ellipsoid zone irregularities","short period of time","Serologic testing","indocyanine green angiography","precedent viral infection","high index of clinical suspicion","unusual cluster of multiple evanescent white dot syndrome","infrared photos","spectral domain optical coherence tomography","dark lesions","blue autofluorescence","combination","patients\u0027 medical records","convalescence stage","choroidal flow","women","man of mean age","retrospective observation study","METHODS","Data","central Israel","unilateral decreased vision","Funduscopy","foveal granularity","RESULTS","years","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","visual recovery","Resolution"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.

CSV2018 attracted 175 attendees from across Canada and around the world, more than double the number that attended the first CSV symposium two years earlier. CSV2018 provided a forum to discuss a wide range of topics in virology including human, veterinary, plant, and microbial pathogens. Invited keynote speakers included David Kelvin (Dalhousie University and Shantou University Medical College) who provided a historical perspective on influenza on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 pandemic; Sylvain Moineau (Universit\u00E9 Laval) who described CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR proteins in warfare between bacteriophages and their host microbes; and Kate O\u2019Brien (then from Johns Hopkins University, now relocated to the World Health Organization where she is Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals), who discussed the underlying viral etiology for pneumonia in the developing world, and the evidence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a primary cause. Reflecting a strong commitment of Canadian virologists to science communication, CSV2018 featured the launch of Halifax\u2019s first annual Soapbox Science event to enable public engagement with female scientists, and the live-taping of the 499th episode of the This Week in Virology (TWIV) podcast, hosted by Vincent Racaniello (Columbia University) and science writer Alan Dove. TWIV featured interviews of CSV co-founders Nathalie Grandvaux (Universit\u00E9 de Montr\u00E9al) and Craig McCormick (Dalhousie University), who discussed the origins and objectives of the new society; Ryan Noyce (University of Alberta), who discussed technical and ethical considerations of synthetic virology; and Kate O\u2019Brien, who discussed vaccines and global health. Finally, because CSV seeks to provide a better future for the next generation of Canadian virologists, the symposium featured a large number of oral and poster presentations from trainees and closed with the awarding of presentation prizes to trainees, followed by a tour of the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and an evening of entertainment at the historic Alexander Keith\u2019s Brewery.","publish_time":"2019-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grandvaux, Nathalie; McCormick, Craig","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9685fb039a5be9e5466be1ee3b0f38a5dd7cc217.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6356965.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["David Kelvin","Sylvain Moineau","Kate O\u2019Brien","Vincent Racaniello","Alan Dove","Nathalie Grandvaux","Craig McCormick","Ryan Noyce"],"organizations":["Dalhousie University","Dalhousie University and Shantou University Medical College","Johns Hopkins University","World Health Organization","Immunization, Vaccines","Columbia University","TWIV","Halifax Citadel National"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["Columbia University","University of Alberta","anniversary of Dalhousie University","CSV2018","Johns Hopkins University","CSV symposium","featured event","Shantou University Medical College","Canadian Society","science communication","Kate O\u2019Brien","generation of Canadian virologists","trainees","developing world","TWIV","Canada","Vaccines","World Health Organization","annual Soapbox Science event","ethical considerations of synthetic virology","strong commitment of Canadian virologists","Universit\u00E9 Laval","science writer Alan Dove","new society","global health","Halifax Citadel National Historic Site","anti-CRISPR proteins","CRISPR-Cas systems","interviews of CSV co-founders Nathalie Grandvaux","large number of oral","historic Alexander Keith\u2019s Brewery","warfare","evening of entertainment","Montr\u00E9al","public engagement","launch of Halifax\u2019s","David Kelvin","RSV","bacteriophages","evidence","Ryan Noyce","female scientists","pneumonia","plant","human","pandemic","poster presentations","host microbes","Director of Immunization","podcast","tour","Vincent Racaniello","Craig McCormick","respiratory syncytial virus","wide range of topics","Sylvain Moineau","keynote speakers","underlying viral etiology","historical perspective","Biologicals","objectives","episode","Week","origins","live-taping","better future","Nova Scotia","awarding of presentation prizes","microbial pathogens","influenza","forum","primary cause","attendees","years"],"language":"en"},

We compared several school-based influenza monitoring systems with clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and assessed the variation in illness rates between and within schools. METHODS: During the initial wave of pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) infections from June to Sept 2009 in Singapore, we collected data on nation-wide laboratory confirmed cases (Sch-LCC) and daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM), and teacher-led febrile respiratory illness reporting in 6 sentinel schools (Sch-FRI). Comparisons were made against age-stratified clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) data from 23 primary care clinics (GP-ILI) and proportions of ILI testing positive for pdmH1N1 (Lab-ILI) by computing the fraction of cumulative incidence occurring by epidemiological week 30 (when GP-ILI incidence peaked); and cumulative incidence rates between school-based indicators and sero-epidemiological pdmH1N1 incidence (estimated from changes in prevalence of A/California/7/2009 H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition titers \u2265 40 between pre-epidemic and post-epidemic sera). Variation in Sch-FRI rates in the 6 schools was also investigated through a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: By week 30, for primary and secondary school children respectively, 63% and 79% of incidence for Sch-LCC had occurred, compared with 50% and 52% for GP-ILI data, and 48% and 53% for Sch-FRI. There were 1,187 notified cases and 7,588 episodes in the Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM systems; given school enrollment of 485,723 children, this represented 0.24 cases and 1.6 episodes per 100 children respectively. Mean Sch-FRI rate was 28.8 per 100 children (95% CI: 27.7 to 29.9) in the 6 schools. We estimate from serology that 41.8% (95% CI: 30.2% to 55.9%) of primary and 43.2% (95% CI: 28.2% to 60.8%) of secondary school-aged children were infected. Sch-FRI rates were similar across the 6 schools (23 to 34 episodes per 100 children), but there was widespread variation by classrooms; in the hierarchical model, omitting age and school effects was inconsequential but neglecting classroom level effects led to highly significant reductions in goodness of fit. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic curves from Sch-FRI were comparable to GP-ILI data, and Sch-FRI detected substantially more infections than Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM. Variability in classroom attack rates suggests localized class-room transmission.","publish_time":"2012-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Mark IC; Chong, Chia Yin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1008bb267f9b05fcec7b715eab47f4a5c659c7dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3544582.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23206689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sch-LCC","Mean Sch","Sch-DTM systems","GP-ILI incidence","GP-ILI data","secondary school children","Lab-ILI","illness rates","school effects","cumulative incidence rates","secondary school-aged children","school-based indicators","school-based influenza monitoring systems","school enrollment","sentinel schools","episodes","sero-epidemiological pdmH1N1 incidence","proportions of ILI testing positive","classroom attack rates","fraction of cumulative incidence","age-stratified clinic-based influenza","important foci of influenza transmission","pre-epidemic","epidemiological week","febrile respiratory illness","Epidemic curves","surveillance","notified cases","infections","widespread variation","post-epidemic sera","primary care clinics","Bayesian hierarchical model","neglecting classroom level effects","daily temperature monitoring","localized class-room transmission","H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition titers","initial wave of pandemic H1N1","potential targets","California","significant reductions","changes","teacher","nation-wide laboratory","Variability","classrooms","goodness of fit","interventions","prevalence","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Comparisons","Singapore","RESULTS","serology"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to assess whether there is a relation between NO2 exposure and the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by proven respiratory viral infections in children. Methods A cohort of 114 asthmatic children aged between 8 and 11 years recorded daily upper and lower respiratory-tract symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and measured personal NO2 exposures every week for up to 13 months. We took nasal aspirates during reported episodes of upper respiratory-tract illness and tested for infection by common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria with RT-PCR assays. We used generalised estimating equations to assess the relation between low (\u003C7\u00B75 \u03BCg/m3), medium (7\u00B75\u201314 \u03BCg/m3), and high (\u003E14 \u03BCg/m3) tertiles of NO2 exposure in the week before or after upper respiratory-tract infection and the severity of asthma exacerbation in the week after the start of an infection. Findings One or more viruses were detected in 78% of reported infection episodes, and the medians of NO2 exposure were 5 (IQR 3\u00B76\u20136\u00B73), 10 (8\u00B77\u201312\u00B70), and 21 \u03BCg/m3 (16\u00B78\u201342\u00B79) for low, medium, and high tertiles, respectively. There were significant increases in the severity of lower respiratory-tract symptom scores across the three tertiles (0\u00B76 for all viruses [p=0\u00B705] and \u003E2 for respiratory syncytial virus [p=0\u00B701]) and a reduction in PEF of more than 12 L/min for picornavirus (p=0\u00B704) for high compared with low NO2 exposure before the start of the virus-induced exacerbation. Interpretation High exposure to NO2 in the week before the start of a respiratory viral infection, and at levels within current air quality standards, is associated with an increase in the severity of a resulting asthma exacerbation.","publish_time":"2003-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chauhan, AJ; Inskip, Hazel M; Linaker, Catherine H; Smith, Sandra; Schreiber, Jacqueline; Johnston, Sebastian L; Holgate, Stephen T","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75c22f23526cd157954ffb428b79562ad0fc65ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112409.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603135829; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603135829","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tertiles of NO2 exposure","low NO2 exposure","upper respiratory-tract infection","respiratory disease","respiratory viral infections","medians of NO2 exposure","common respiratory viruses","lower respiratory-tract symptoms","respiratory syncytial virus","week","\u03BCg","m3","Interpretation High exposure","severity of lower respiratory-tract symptom scores","reported episodes of upper respiratory-tract illness","high tertiles","severity of asthma exacerbations","reported infection episodes","start","personal NO2 exposures","resulting asthma exacerbation","major cause of asthma exacerbations","relation","PEF","virus-induced exacerbation","asthmatic children","air pollutant nitrogen dioxide","current air quality standards","atypical bacteria","levels","peak expiratory flow","link","RT-PCR assays","nasal aspirates","years","significant increases","generalised estimating equations","Methods","cohort","Summary Background","IQR","reduction","picornavirus","Findings","months"],"language":"en"},

It contains two hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) regions, denoted HRN and HRC, which oligomerize the S glycoprotein into a trimer in the native state and when activated collapse into a six-helix bundle structure driving fusion of the host and viral membranes. Previous studies have shown that peptides of the HR regions can inhibit viral infectivity. These studies imply that the HR regions are accessible and that agents which can interact with them may prevent viral entry. In the present study, we have investigated an approach to generate antibodies that specifically recognize the HRN and HRC regions of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein in order to evaluate whether these antibodies can inhibit viral infectivity and thus neutralize the SARS-CoV. In this regard, we incorporated HRN and HRC coiled-coil surface residues into a de novo designed two-stranded \u03B1-helical coiled-coil template for generating conformation-specific antibodies that recognize \u03B1-helices in proteins (Lu, S.M., Hodges, R.S., 2002. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 23515\u201323524). Eighteen surface residues from two regions of HRN and HRC were incorporated into the template and used to generate four anti-sera, HRN1, HRN2, HRC1, and HRC2. Our results show that all of the elicited anti-sera can specifically recognize HRN or HRC peptides and the native SARS-CoV S protein in an ELISA format. Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis, however, showed only HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could bind to native S protein expressed on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells, i.e., the cell surface structure of the S glycoprotein precluded the ability of the HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera to see their respective epitope sites. In in vitro viral infectivity assays, no inhibition was observed for either HRN1 or HRN2 anti-serum, whereas both HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could inhibit SARS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HRC1 anti-serum, which was a more effective inhibitor of viral infectivity compared to HRC2 anti-serum, could only bind the pre-fusogenic state of HRC, i.e., the HRC1 anti-serum did not recognize the six-helix bundle conformation (fusion state) whereas HRC2 anti-serum did. These results suggest that antibodies that are more specific for the pre-fusogenic state of HRC may be better neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the two-stranded coiled-coil template acts as an excellent presentation system for eliciting helix-specific antibodies against highly conserved viral antigens and HRC1 and HRC2 peptides may represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tripet, Brian; Kao, Daniel J.; Jeffers, Scott A.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Hodges, Robert S.","journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec510078f9875e7434d82e8c8f59df4be52c11ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129695.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847706001122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847706001122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hodges","J.

An increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), asthma-related hospitalizations and use of anti-inflammatory medication have all been linked with low vitamin D. No study has determined whether wintertime vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of URTI and asthma exacerbations, two of the most common and costly illnesses of early childhood. The objectives of this study are: 1) to compare the effect of \u2018high dose\u2019 (2000 IU/day) vs. \u2018standard dose\u2019 (400 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation in achieving reductions in laboratory confirmed URTI and asthma exacerbations during the winter in preschool-aged Canadian children; and 2) to assess the effect of \u2018high dose\u2019 vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D serum levels and specific viruses that cause URTI. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Over 4 successive winters we will recruit 750 healthy children 1\u20135 years of age. Participating physicians are part of a primary healthcare research network called TARGet Kids!. Children will be randomized to the \u2018standard dose\u2019 or \u2018high dose\u2019 oral supplemental vitamin D for a minimum of 4 months (200 children per group). Parents will obtain a nasal swab from their child with each URTI, report the number of asthma exacerbations and complete symptom checklists. Unscheduled physician visits for URTIs and asthma exacerbations will be recorded. By May, a blood sample will be drawn to determine vitamin D serum levels. The primary analysis will be a comparison of URTI rate between study groups using a Poisson regression model. Secondary analyses will compare vitamin D serum levels, asthma exacerbations and the frequency of specific viral agents between groups. DISCUSSION: Identifying whether vitamin D supplementation of preschoolers can reduce wintertime viral URTIs and asthma exacerbations and what dose is optimal may reduce population wide morbidity and associated health care and societal costs. This information will assist in determining practice and health policy recommendations related to vitamin D supplementation in healthy Canadian preschoolers.","publish_time":"2014-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maguire, Jonathon L; Birken, Catherine S; Loeb, Mark B; Mamdani, Muhammad; Thorpe, Kevin; Hoch, Jeffrey S; Mazzulli, Tony; Borkhoff, Cornelia M; Macarthur, Colin; Parkin, Patricia C","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c1647ec918ab799e8f2dc782620024844c52a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3942179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506910/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-14-37","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vitamin D levels","vitamin D supplementation of preschoolers","wintertime vitamin D supplementation","vitamin D serum levels","low vitamin","oral supplemental vitamin D","number of asthma exacerbations","high dose","risk of URTI","standard dose","healthy children","asthma-related hospitalizations","study groups","comparison of URTI rate","wintertime viral URTIs","preschool-aged Canadian children","IU","healthy Canadian preschoolers","day","North American children older","effect","frequency of specific viral agents","specific viruses","primary analysis","increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections","associated health care","health policy recommendations","primary healthcare research network","pragmatic randomized controlled trial","population wide morbidity","minimum","laboratory","reductions","TARGet Kids","societal costs","complete symptom checklists","Unscheduled physician visits","Poisson regression model","Secondary analyses","costly illnesses of early childhood","practice","months","nasal swab","anti-inflammatory medication","DESIGN","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","Participating physicians","successive winters","years of age","Parents","METHODS","blood sample","information","nmol","objectives"],"language":"en"},

Nurses and doctors often cope by working part time or switching jobs. Hospital administrators and health care practitioners themselves may underestimate the effects of work-related critical incidents. Relevant online databases were searched for original research published from inception to 2009 and manual searches of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, reference lists, and the European Traumatic Stress Research Database were conducted. Two researchers independently decided on inclusion and study quality. Effect sizes were estimated using standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Consistency was evaluated, using the I 2-statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Eleven studies, which included 3866 participants, evaluated the relationship between work-related critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Six of these studies, which included 1695 participants, also reported on the relationship between work-related critical incidents and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Heterogeneity among studies was high and could not be accounted for by study quality, character of the incident, or timing of data collection. Pooled effect sizes for the impact of work-related critical incidents on post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression were small to medium. Remarkably, the effect was more pronounced in the longer than in the shorter term. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that work-related critical incidents are positively related to post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in hospital-based health care professionals.

The emergence and spread of new IBV genotypes have frustrated the various disease control efforts implemented over time. Despite that, few comprehensive and large scale studies have been performed to understand the international and local spreading dynamics of this virus. In the present work, these phenomena were evaluated by implementing a Bayesian phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the epidemiological patterns and population history of the QX genotype (currently renamed GI-19 lineage), the most relevant IBV lineage of the Old-World. Our analysis, based on 807 partial S1 sequences of strains collected from 18 countries between 1993 and 2015, demonstrates that this genotype originated in China well before its first identification. After a prolonged local circulation, it started spreading to other European, Asian and Middle East countries in successive waves, which were mirrored by concomitant fluctuations in viral population size. Interestingly, the within-Europe spread was characterized by a higher estimated migration rate compared with the inter-continental one, potentially reflecting the closer geographic and economic relationships among these countries. Nevertheless, the colonization of new states by the GI-19 lineage appeared to occur mostly by single introduction events in both intra and inter-continental spread, likely because of epidemiological factor and health policy combination which seems to prevent the frequent introduction and mixing of different strains. On the other hand, the within Italy QX circulation reconstruction showed a much more intricate connection network among different locations, evidencing the difficulty in controlling IBV spread especially in highly densely poultry populated areas. The presence of several well supported epidemiological links among distantly related Italian regions testifies that animal transportation and indirect transmission routes rather than local airborne diffusion contribute to the QX success and persistence at local scale. Globally, the spreading dynamics and evolution of the QX genotype were reconstructed from its very origin to nowadays, demonstrating the need of more effective direct control measures, particularly within each country. Unfortunately, the incompleteness of available molecular epidemiology data represents an insurmountable limit which leaves many questions currently unsolved, thus highlighting the compulsoriness of a structured monitoring and data sharing system implementation.","publish_time":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Massi, Paola; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Barbieri, Ilaria; Tosi, Giovanni; Fiorentini, Laura; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Lavazza, Antonio; Cecchinato, Mattia; Moreno, Ana","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c39dd28fc793a6826ea646a27b79cdf565a42cde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5589226.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28880958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QX"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["QX genotype","local scale","local spreading dynamics","inter-continental spread","relevant IBV lineage","QX success","Europe spread","new IBV genotypes","prolonged local circulation","epidemiological factor","epidemiological patterns","local airborne diffusion","Italy QX circulation reconstruction","Middle East countries","different strains","supported epidemiological links","population history","different locations","renamed GI","frequent introduction","viral population size","single introduction events","colonization of new states","large scale studies","Infectious bronchitis virus","data sharing system implementation","various disease control efforts","effective direct control measures","poultry industry major threats","partial S1 sequences of strains","incompleteness of available molecular epidemiology data","animal transportation","related Italian regions","indirect transmission routes","intra","insurmountable limit","structured monitoring","need","intricate connection network","health policy combination","successive waves","higher estimated migration rate","concomitant fluctuations","high density","compulsoriness","time","Bayesian phylodynamic approach","economic relationships","persistence","evolution","phenomena","questions","presence","difficulty","hand","emergence","present work","analysis","country","China","origin","identification","areas"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions\u2014in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein\u2014represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection.

The human Corona virus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006). Following infection of Vero118 cells, virus-induced CPE was too low to allow readout based on classical colorimetric methods (such as the MTS assay), even following prolonged incubation times (\u003E7 days). To develop an antiviral screenings-assay against HCoV-NL63, we explored whether a dead-cell protease substrate could be used instead. The substrate used is a quenched peptide (bis-AAF-R110) that releases a fluorophore upon proteolytic-cleavage by proteases; the latter released from dead cells. Following different rounds of optimization a screening protocol was developed: Vero118 cells in 96-well plate format were infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI=0.01; 200\u03BCL cell culture; 2.104 cells/mL, IMDM 5% FBS medium). Cultures were subsequently incubated for 5 days at 35\u00B0C after which 20\u03BCL of the peptide solution was added. Fluorescence was quantitated 2 hr after incubation at 37\u00B0C. A roughly 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the infected cultures was observed as compared to the uninfected cultures with a low well-to-well variability. Z\u2019 factors calculated from different experiments were in the range of 0.6\u20130.8, indicating excellent assay quality. An anti-ACE2 polyclonal antiserum (that prevents coronavirus infection in cell cultures) was used as a positive control and allowed to validate the assay for antiviral screening purposes. In conclusion, in conditions where a viability staining is inadequate to quantitate virus-induced CPE, a novel simple and convenient method that detects cell-death and that is suitable for high-throughput screening purposes can be employed.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jochmans, Dirk; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/452dee76eee0fc72fa4371889697751854c99785.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112866.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412001383; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.04.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575574/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412001383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of cell cultures","cell-death","HCoV-NL63","virus-induced CPE","different cell lines","infection of Vero118 cells","\u03BCL cell culture","antiviral screening purposes","antiviral screenings-assay","dead cells","uninfected cultures","days","dead-cell protease substrate","antiviral screenings purposes","limited CPE","complete CPE","human Corona virus NL63","MTS assay","coronavirus infection","screening protocol","high-throughput screening purposes","different experiments","factors","excellent assay quality","different rounds of optimization","fluorescence intensity","quenched peptide","peptide solution","calculation of acceptable Z","prolonged incubation times","convenient method","readout","viability staining","classical colorimetric methods","anti-ACE2 polyclonal antiserum","fluorophore","conditions","proteases","R110","bis-AAF","plate format","Abstract","Schildgen","MOI","fold increase","proteolytic-cleavage","IMDM","study","FBS medium","conclusion","variability","range","positive control","induction"],"language":"en"},

In addition, overexpression of the IFITM3 protein potently inhibits the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in ducks and chickens. Although chickens are a major host of influenza viruses and the IFITM3 gene participates in the host antiviral system, studies on chicken IFITM3 gene are very rare. To investigate the genetic characteristics of the chicken IFITM3 gene, we performed direct sequencing and alignment in 108 Dekalb White and 72 Ross breeds. We also investigated the genotype and haplotype frequencies and linkage disequilibrium of the IFITM3 gene polymorphisms and evaluated whether the non-synonymous SNPs are deleterious. We found significantly different genotype, allele and haplotypes frequencies between two chicken breeds, Dekalb White and Ross. Furthermore, we compared and analyzed the promoter structure of the chicken IFITM3 gene with that of several species. We found that birds have a long C-terminal domain and inverted topology of the IFITM3 protein compared to mammals. We also identified fourteen genetic polymorphisms in the chicken IFITM3 gene.

Several published meta-analyses have provided quantitative summaries for some of these associations, but not for respiratory infections. Demonstrating a causal relationship between dampness-related agents, which are preventable exposures, and respiratory tract infections would suggest important new public health strategies. We report the results of quantitative meta-analyses of published studies that examined the association of dampness or mold in homes with respiratory infections and bronchitis. METHODS: For primary studies meeting eligibility criteria, we transformed reported odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) to the log scale. Both fixed and random effects models were applied to the log ORs and their variances. Most studies contained multiple estimated ORs. Models accounted for the correlation between multiple results within the studies analyzed. One set of analyses was performed with all eligible studies, and another set restricted to studies that controlled for age, gender, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Subgroups of studies were assessed to explore heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: The resulting summary estimates of ORs from random effects models based on all studies ranged from 1.38 to 1.50, with 95% CIs excluding the null in all cases. Use of different analysis models and restricting analyses based on control of multiple confounding variables changed findings only slightly. ORs (95% CIs) from random effects models using studies adjusting for major confounding variables were, for bronchitis, 1.45 (1.32-1.59); for respiratory infections, 1.44 (1.31-1.59); for respiratory infections excluding nonspecific upper respiratory infections, 1.50 (1.32-1.70), and for respiratory infections in children or infants, 1.48 (1.33-1.65). Little effect of publication bias was evident. Estimated attributable risk proportions ranged from 8% to 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Residential dampness and mold are associated with substantial and statistically significant increases in both respiratory infections and bronchitis. If these associations were confirmed as causal, effective control of dampness and mold in buildings would prevent a substantial proportion of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisk, William J; Eliseeva, Ekaterina A; Mendell, Mark J","journal":"Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cb75a42281bf540c142bec979a4bc66da597a3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3000394.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069x-9-72; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21078183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract infections","substantial proportion of respiratory infections","nonspecific upper respiratory infections","primary studies","eligible studies","Subgroups of studies","random effects models","mold","variety of adverse respiratory health effects","results of quantitative meta-analyses of published studies","log ORs","multiple estimated ORs","association of dampness","Residential dampness","CIs","set of analyses","multiple results","bronchitis","published meta-analyses","effective control of dampness","dampness-related agents","different analysis models","control of multiple confounding variables","resulting summary estimates of ORs","associations","major confounding variables","quantitative summaries","causal relationship","Little effect of publication bias","log scale","important new public health strategies","eligibility criteria","preventable exposures","reported odds ratios","homes","gender","confidence intervals","buildings","significant increases","smoking","findings","correlation","socioeconomic status","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","children","infants","Funnel plots","qualitative reviews","attributable risk proportions","null","cases","variances","BACKGROUND","heterogeneity"],"language":"en"},

Although the pathogenesis of BOOP is still incompletely understood, BOOP is responsive to steroids and has a good prognosis. In our five pigs with chronic postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), typical BOOP lesions were revealed. All five porcine lungs showed typical intraluminal plugs, and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was identified. They also exhibited similar pathologic findings such as proliferation of type II pneumocytes and myofibroblasts (MFBs), extracellular collagen matrix (ECM) deposition, and fragmentation of elastic fibers. MFBs migration correlative molecules, for instance, gelatinase A, B and osteopontin, appeared strongly in the progressing marginal area of polypoid intraluminal plugs of fibrotic lesion. These molecules colocalized with the active MFBs. Both gelatinase activity and intercellular level of active MFBs were significantly increased (P \u003C .05). Porcine chronic bronchopneumonia leads to BOOP and it is associated with PCV2 persistent infection. Swine BOOP demonstrates similar cellular constituents with human BOOP. Perhaps their molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis operate in a similar way. Thus we infer that the swine BOOP can be considered as a potential animal model for human BOOP associated with natural viral infection. Moreover, it is more convenient to obtain samples.","publish_time":"2010-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Ching-Chang; Lee, Yen-Feng; Lin, Nai-Nu; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Tung, Kwong-Chung; Chiu, Yung-Tsung","journal":"J Biomed Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc2e7594049d91279f4e3d69d27b440ddd8de1f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2952812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976305/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/245728","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BOOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human BOOP","pathogenesis of BOOP","Swine BOOP","typical BOOP lesions","Porcine chronic bronchopneumonia","typical intraluminal plugs","porcine circovirus type","intercellular level of active MFBs","porcine lungs","MFBs migration correlative molecules","similar way","similar cellular constituents","chronic postweaning multisystemic","similar pathologic findings","chronic respiratory disease","PCV2 persistent infection","proliferation of type","gelatinase activity","natural viral infection","molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis","progressing marginal area of polypoid intraluminal plugs of fibrotic lesion","deposition","PMWS","syndrome","myofibroblasts","instance","extracellular collagen matrix","ECM","potential animal model","Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia","pigs","steroids","pneumocytes","fragmentation of elastic fibers","osteopontin","good prognosis","samples"],"language":"en"},

The normal human bronchogram shows that the length of pathways from the trachea to the terminal airways differs depending on the pathway followed and it can take as few as 8 or as many as 24 divisions of airway branching to reach the gas-exchanging surface. The small bronchi and bronchioles 2 mm in diameter are spread out from the fourth to the fourteenth generation of airway branching. The pathology of asthma is dominated by widespread plugging of the segmental, subsegmental, and smaller conducting airways that leads to hyperinflation but not destruction of the parenchyma. These airway plugs are a manifestation of the fluid and cellular exudative phase of an inflammatory process based in the airway tissue. The chronic bronchitis of COPD is defined by excess cough with sputum production and is associated with an inflammatory process located in the mucosa, gland ducts, and glands of intermediate-sized bronchi between 2 and 4 mm internal diameter. The airway obstruction in COPD is the result of a similar inflammatory response in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles under 2 mm internal diameter, where the repair process associated with chronic inflammation thickens the airway wall and narrows the lumen to cause fixed airway obstruction.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogg, James C.","journal":"Asthma and COPD","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34c4ff512899563b0599be979c7c2c1b614bd16b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150166.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway wall","airway plugs","airway tissue","divisions of airway","fixed airway obstruction","generation of airway branching","inflammatory process","smaller bronchi","internal diameter","chronic bronchitis of COPD","repair process","chronic inflammation","pathology of asthma","sized bronchi","bronchioles","small bronchi","similar inflammatory response","smaller conducting airways","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","terminal airways","human lung","normal human bronchogram","subsegmental","result","cellular exudative phase","glands of intermediate","fluid","anatomy","hyperinflation","manifestation","mucosa","lumen","length of pathways","gland ducts","excess cough","widespread plugging","chapter","trachea","sputum production","Publisher Summary","destruction","parenchyma","gas","surface"],"language":"en"},

It is proposed that virus is normally latent in many elderly brains but reactivates periodically (as in the peripheral nervous system) under certain conditions, for example stress, immunosuppression, and peripheral infection, causing cumulative damage and eventually development of AD. Diverse approaches have provided data that explicitly support, directly or indirectly, these concepts. Several have confirmed HSV1 DNA presence in human brains, and the HSV1-APOE-\u03B54 association in AD. Further, studies on HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic mice have shown that APOE-e4 animals display a greater potential for viral damage. Reactivated HSV1 can cause direct and inflammatory damage, probably involving increased formation of beta amyloid (A\u03B2) and of AD-like tau (P-tau)\u2014changes found to occur in HSV1-infected cell cultures. Implicating HSV1 further in AD is the discovery that HSV1 DNA is specifically localized in amyloid plaques in AD. Other relevant, harmful effects of infection include the following: dynamic interactions between HSV1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP), which would affect both viral and APP transport; induction of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in HSV1-infected astrocyte cultures, which has been linked to the likely effects of reactivation of the virus in brain. Several epidemiological studies have shown, using serological data, an association between systemic infections and cognitive decline, with HSV1 particularly implicated. Genetic studies too have linked various pathways in AD with those occurring on HSV1 infection. In relation to the potential usage of antivirals to treat AD patients, acyclovir (ACV) is effective in reducing HSV1-induced AD-like changes in cell cultures, and valacyclovir, the bioactive form of ACV, might be most effective if combined with an antiviral that acts by a different mechanism, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).","publish_time":"2014-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Itzhaki, Ruth F.","journal":"Front Aging Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c8323be8a418f5df5d877da4a51720e9aa60425.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4128394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157230/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV1-APOE","HSV1 infection","Reactivated HSV1","Implicating HSV1","HSV1-induced AD","HSV1 DNA presence","HSV1-infected cell cultures","HSV1-infected astrocyte cultures","HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic mice","AD patients","peripheral infection","viral damage","inflammatory damage","amyloid plaques","APOE-e4 animals","changes","cumulative damage","harmful effects of infection","Genetic studies","epidemiological studies","Herpes simplex virus type","amyloid precursor protein","increased formation of beta amyloid","greater potential","\u03B54 association","human brains","serological data","APP transport","elderly brains","brain of carriers","P-tau","potential usage of antivirals","peripheral nervous system","bioactive form of ACV","likely effects of reactivation","certain conditions","dynamic interactions","systemic infections","valacyclovir","cognitive decline","following","example stress","allele","induction of toll","immunosuppression","A\u03B2","TLRs","apolipoprotein E gene","intravenous immunoglobulin","different mechanism","development of","major factor","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","receptors","various pathways","discovery","Diverse approaches","relation","present","IVIG","concepts"],"language":"en"},

KIOM 198 and KIOM 124 were identified as Epimedium koreanum Nakai and Lonicera japonica Thunberg, respectively. The further plaque and CPE inhibition assay in vitro showed that KIOM 198 has much stronger antiviral activity than KIOM 124. Additionally, KIOM 198 exhibited a similar extent of antiviral effect against other subtypes of Corona virus such as sm98 and TGE viruses. Cytotoxicity results showed that KIOM 198 is nontoxic on the cells and suggest that it can be delivered safely for therapy. Furthermore, when we orally administered KIOM 198 to piglets and then infected them with PEDV, the piglets did not show any disease symptoms like diarrhea and biopsy results showed clean intestine, whereas control pigs without KIOM 198 treatment exhibited PED-related severe symptoms. These results imply that KIOM 198 contains strong antiviral activity and has a potential to be developed as an antiviral phytomedicine to treat PEDV-related diseases in pigs.","publish_time":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Won-Kyung; Kim, Hyunil; Choi, Yu Jeong; Yim, Nam-Hui; Yang, Hye Jin; Ma, Jin Yeul","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e3b24f55fdc84cfc263d4784c6ad6349d212866.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3521454.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259003/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/985151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","CPE","TGE","KIOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["administered KIOM","antiviral phytomedicine","strong antiviral activity","stronger antiviral activity","diarrhea of pigs age","new antiviral candidates","PEDV-related diseases","similar extent of antiviral effect","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","control pigs","biopsy results","Cytotoxicity results","PED-related severe symptoms","death of young piglets","disease symptoms","herbal extracts","significant anti-PED viral effect","subtypes of Corona virus","natural oriental herbal medicines","economic loss of porcine industry","treatment","clean intestine","Epimedium koreanum Nakai","Lonicera japonica Thunberg","sm98","CPE inhibition assay","potential","TGE viruses","plaque","cells","therapy"],"language":"en"},

The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies increases with age in camels, while the prevalence of viral shedding as determined by MERS-CoV RNA detection in nasal swabs decreases. In several studies, camels that were sampled at animal markets or quarantine facilities were seropositive more often than camels at farms as well as imported camels vs. locally bred camels.

Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and risk of exposure to the infectious disease. The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individuals, society and the nursing profession. Objectives To synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic. Design This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews. Data sources A structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted. Review methods All studies describing nurses\u2019 experiences were included regardless of methodology. Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute. Results Thirteen qualitative studies were included in the review. The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning. Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction. Conclusions Nurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics. This systematic review emphasises that nurses\u2019 require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic. Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandez, Professor Ritin; Lord, Heidi; Halcomb, Professor Elizabeth; Moxham, Professor Lorna; Middleton, Dr. Rebekkah; Alananzeh, Dr. Ibrahim; Ellwood, Laura","journal":"Int J Nurs Stud","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/802cb5d02ebe0f154929f06aba0d80610c0cf843.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206441.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748920301218; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748920301218?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Joanna Briggs Institute"],"organizations":["Background Pandemics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nursing care","experiences of nurses","Conclusions Nurses","health care response","nursing groups","nursing workforce","nursing profession","quality care","nurses\u2019 experiences","Review methods","public health response","Supportive nursing teams","public health emergencies","direct patient care","Joanna Briggs Institute methodology","epidemics","infectious disease pandemics","categories","Data sources","substantial deaths","systematic reviews","qualitative studies","synthesized findings","substantial psychological issues","Abstract Background Pandemics","SUMARI data extraction tool","MedNar","PubMed","CINAHL","individuals","Governments","Cochrane Library","Google Scholar","long term consequences","MEDLINE","EMBASE","papers","society","risk of exposure","crises","structured search","ProQuest","potential","burnout","policy makers","key role","acute hospital settings","Index","best available evidence","context","Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction","narrative statements","Theses","socio-economic disruption","loss","total","emotional impact","Themes","similarity of meaning","Results","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3\u2032 end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, which is currently designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs at the 3\u2032 ends of their genomes. The presence of ORF 6b in three of four viruses in this antigenic cluster strongly suggests that TGEV has lost this ORF by deletion. The CCV ORF 6b is collinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the collinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other. Previously, we showed that the expression product of the FIPV ORF 6b can be detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation (Vennema et al., 1992).

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for \u22643 d, while in other 5 cases lasted \u003E 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, D; Ju, X L; Xie, F; Lu, Y; Li, F Y; Huang, H H; Fang, X L; Li, Y J; Wang, J Y; Yi, B; Yue, J X; Wang, J; Wang, L X; Li, B; Wang, Y; Qiu, B P; Zhou, Z Y; Li, K L; Sun, J H; Liu, X G; Li, G D; Wang, Y J; Cao, A H; Chen, Y N","journal":"Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200225-00138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["cases of moderate fever","cases of low fever","family cluster cases","children","clinical types","clinical manifestations","clinical symptoms","asymptomatic type","case of high fever","provinces","autonomous region","short-term prognosis","common types","mild type","close family contact","chest imaging","epidemiological history","supportive treatment","general treatment","Close contact history of epidemiology","nCoV infections","critical type","northern China","asymptomatic returnees","years","common symptom","case series","lymphocytes count","platelet count","days","patients","nucleic acid detection","viral nucleic acid","laboratory examination results","laboratory examinations","abnormal chest CT changes","blood glucose","peripheral blood","liver enzyme","muscle enzyme","signs","dizziness","Gansu","Shaanxi","important bases","patchy ground glass opacities","headache","Ningxia","Hebei","nodules","total leukocytes","runny nose","retrospective analysis","lungs","vomiting","Henan","Renal function","diagnosis","novel coronavirus","Elevation of C","reactive protein","lower lobe","early stage","Shandong","Pharyngalgia","months","pleural area","confirmed infected adults","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","Methods","Conclusions","Wuhan","hospitals","Objective","cough","fatigue","diarrhea","different proportions","procalcitonin","death"],"language":"en"},

Treatment of glioma models in vitro and in vivo with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists variably amplifies or attenuates cellular proliferation. In the majority of in vivo models, \u03B2 adrenergic agonists generally reduce cellular proliferation. However, treatment with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists consistently reduces tumor cell invasive potential, angiogenesis, and metastasis. \u03B2 adrenergic agonists induced decreases of invasive potential are chiefly mediated through reductions in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases types 2 and 9. Treatment with \u03B2 adrenergic agonists also clearly reduce tumoral neoangiogenesis, which may represent a putatively useful mechanism to adjuvantly amplify the effects of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. We may accordingly designate \u03B2agonists to represent an enhancer of bevacizumab. The antiangiogenic effects of \u03B2 adrenergic agonists may thus effectively render an otherwise borderline effective therapy to generate significant enhancement in clinical outcomes. \u03B2 adrenergic agonists upregulate expression of the major histocompatibility class II DR alpha gene, effectively potentiating the immunogenicity of tumor cells to tumor surveillance mechanisms. Authors have also demonstrated crossmodal modulation of signaling events downstream from the \u03B2 adrenergic cell surface receptor and microtubular polymerization and depolymerization. Complex effects and desensitization mechanisms of the \u03B2 adrenergic signaling may putatively represent promising therapeutic targets. Constant stimulation of the \u03B2 adrenergic receptor induces its phosphorylation by \u03B2 adrenergic receptor kinase (\u03B2ARK), rendering it a suitable substrate for alternate binding by \u03B2 arrestins 1 or 2. The binding of a \u03B2 arrestin to \u03B2ARK phosphorylated \u03B2AR promotes receptor mediated internalization and downregulation of cell surface receptor and contemporaneously generates a cell surface scaffold at the \u03B2AR. The scaffold mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, compared with protein kinase A mediated activation, preferentially favors cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 and blunting of nuclear translocation and ensuant pro-transcriptional activity. Thus, \u03B2AR desensitization and consequent scaffold assembly effectively retains the cytosolic homeostatic functions of ERK1/2 while inhibiting its pro-proliferative effects. We suggest these mechanisms specifically will prove quite promising in developing primary and adjuvant therapies mitigating glioma growth, angiogenesis, invasive potential, and angiogenesis. We suggest generating compounds and targeted mutations of the \u03B2 adrenergic receptor favoring \u03B2 arrestin binding and scaffold facilitated activation of ERK1/2 may hold potential promise and therapeutic benefit in adjuvantly treating most or all cancers. We hope our discussion will generate fruitful research endeavors seeking to exploit these mechanisms.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghali, George Zaki; Ghali, Michael George Zaki","journal":"Mol Biol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe1d22b6fd8c5fb558baca6f917760964eb30997.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303958/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05427-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2 adrenergic receptor kinase","\u03B2 adrenergic cell surface receptor","\u03B2 arrestins","antiangiogenic effects of \u03B2 adrenergic agonists","\u03B2 arrestin binding","active cell surface \u03B2 adrenergic receptors","cell surface scaffold","downregulation of cell surface receptor","receptor mediated internalization","tumor cell invasive potential","effects of bevacizumab","activation of ERK1","desensitization mechanisms","decreases of invasive potential","scaffold mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase","tumor surveillance mechanisms","potential promise","\u03B2AR desensitization","Complex effects","vascular endothelial growth factor receptor","Treatment of glioma models","pro-proliferative effects","glioma growth","\u03B2ARK phosphorylated \u03B2AR","consequent scaffold assembly","protein kinase","alternate binding","cytosolic retention of ERK1","cellular proliferation","enhancer of bevacizumab","cytosolic homeostatic functions of ERK1","immunogenicity of tumor cells","promising therapeutic targets","therapeutic benefit","ensuant pro-transcriptional activity","expression of matrix metalloproteinases types","major histocompatibility class","phosphorylation","significant enhancement","microtubular polymerization","adjuvant therapies","DR alpha gene","nuclear translocation","monoclonal antibody","reductions","suitable substrate","astrocytes","events","targeted mutations","\u03B2ARs","borderline effective therapy","depolymerization","fruitful research endeavors","Constant stimulation","clinical outcomes","tumoral neoangiogenesis","discussion","crossmodal modulation","Neoplastically","compounds","metastasis","majority of","designate \u03B2agonists","Authors","useful mechanism","cancers"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, RNAi represents a promising novel therapeutic option for treating human diseases, in particular cancer. Selective gene silencing by RNAi can be achieved essentially by two nucleic acid based methods: i) cytoplasmic delivery of short double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), where the gene silencing effect is only transient in nature, and possibly not suitable for all applications; or ii) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which are processed like endogenous interfering RNA and lead to stable gene down-regulation. Both processes involve the use of nucleic acid based drugs, which are highly charged and do not cross cell membranes by free diffusion. Therefore, in vivo delivery of RNAi therapeutics must use technology that enables the RNAi therapeutic to traverse biological membrane barriers in vivo. Viruses and the vectors derived from them carry out precisely this task and have become a major delivery system for shRNA. Here, we summarize and compare different currently used viral delivery systems, give examples of in vivo applications, and indicate trends for new developments, such as replicating viruses for shRNA delivery to cancer cells.","publish_time":"2010-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sliva, Katja; Schnierle, Barbara S","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d15737a61bc7a5c77a10ff81579ab5ffcaab4393.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2949849.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shRNA delivery","delivery of RNAi therapeutics","viral delivery systems","major delivery system","nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes","stable gene","cytoplasmic delivery of short double","RNA oligonucleotides","RNA interference","short hairpin RNA","gene silencing effect","Selective gene silencing","endogenous interfering RNA","technology","applications","use of nucleic acid based drugs","nucleic acid based methods","replicating viruses","cancer cells","particular cancer","cell culture","cross cell membranes","promising novel therapeutic option","validation","human diseases","lead","rapid drug target discovery","siRNA","functional genomics","new developments","free diffusion","nature","targets","biological membrane barriers","examples of","powerful tool","trends","regulation","processes","task","vectors"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine, compare, and assess determinants of unit-specific HA-VRI incidence rates in 2 children\u2019s hospitals. METHODS: This study was a retrospective comparison of prospective cohorts. The Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital and the Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York perform prospective surveillance for HA-VRI using standardized definitions that require the presence of symptoms compatible with VRI and virus detection. Cases detected between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2013, were identified using surveillance databases. Annual incidence rates were calculated, and a generalized estimating equation model was used to assess determinants of HA-VRI rates. RESULTS: The overall HA-VRI rate during the 3-year study period was significantly higher at Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital than that at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York (1.91 vs 0.80 per 1000 patient-days, respectively; P \u003C .0001). Overall, the HA-VRI incidence rate was lowest in the neonatal intensive care unit. Rates in the pediatric intensive care, oncology, and medical/surgical units were similar. The most common etiology of HA-VRI at both institutions was rhinovirus (49% of cases), followed by parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Hospitals with less than 50% single rooms had HA-VRI rates 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.29\u20131.37) times higher than hospitals with more than 50% single rooms for a given unit type. CONCLUSIONS: HA-VRI rates were substantial but different among 2 children\u2019s hospitals. Future studies should examine the effect of HA-VRI and evaluate best practices for preventing such infections.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quach, Caroline; Shah, Rita; Rubin, Lorry G","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87323d1a1115a74f3d549c226cc1340bc38efdd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204516.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28040689/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piw072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Montreal Children","Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HA-VRI rates","specific HA-VRI incidence rates","overall HA-VRI rate","determinants of HA","effect of HA","children\u2019s hospitals","common etiology of HA","Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital","Annual incidence rates","Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York","determinants of unit","neonatal intensive care unit","prospective surveillance","parainfluenza virus","single rooms","respiratory syncytial virus","virus detection","Cases","pediatric intensive care","viral respiratory infections","given unit type","retrospective comparison of prospective cohorts","times higher","surveillance databases","year study period","oncology","VRIs","presence of symptoms compatible","vs","standardized definitions","surgical units","pediatrics","generalized estimating equation model","best practices","patient-days","benchmark","healthcare","rhinovirus","confidence interval","institutions","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Future studies","METHODS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

As recognition of both the importance and vulnerability of bats grows, particularly following population declines in North America due to the introduction of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome, efforts should be made to better understand threats to the health of this unique group of mammals.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farina, Lisa L.; Lankton, Julia S.","journal":"Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e19579001a460920d213d85e6fd2686a9e7afd5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182108.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128053065000250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128053065000250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Antarctica","North America"],"keyphrases":["diseases of bats","vulnerability of bats","non-infectious diseases","ecological importance","unique group of mammals","disease transmission","world\u2019s mammals","wide variety of ecological niches","fungal disease white-nose syndrome","histological features","introduction","crucial environmental services","insect control","following population","pollination","North America","continents","bats\u2019 role","reservoirs","efforts","health","captive","pathologic processes","Antarctica","quarter","recognition","threats","chapter","species","ubiquity","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

An etiological diagnosis was made in 51.8% of 197 patients. The most common pathogens were M. pneumoniae (29.4%) followed by influenza virus A, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (9.6%), and S. pneumoniae (4.1%). Patients with mycoplasma infections were younger, less likely to have comorbidities, and less likely to have adequate sputum for gram stain and culture. Patients with viral infections were older and more likely to have poorly defined nodules on chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Among patients infected with M. pneumoniae, those with quinolones as initial prescriptions had shorter duration of fever after the initiation of antibiotics than patients with \u03B2-lactams, macrolides, or \u03B2-lactams \u002B macrolides (p \u003C 0.05).

Introduction of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal vaccines in developed countries including Australia has significantly reduced the overall burden of bacterial pneumonia. With the availability of molecular diagnostics, viruses are frequently detected in children with pneumonia either as primary pathogens or predispose to secondary bacterial infection. Many respiratory pathogens that are known to cause pneumonia are also identified in asymptomatic children, so the true contribution of these pathogens to childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, very few comprehensive studies from developed countries have attempted to determine the bacterial and viral aetiology of pneumonia. We aim to determine the contribution of bacteria and viruses to childhood CAP to inform further development of effective diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a prospective case\u2013control study (PneumoWA) where cases are children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) and controls are healthy children identified from PMH outpatient clinics and from local community immunisation clinics. The case\u2013control ratio is 1:1 with 250 children to be recruited in each arm. Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected from both cases and controls to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria by PCR; pathogen load will be assessed by quantitative PCR. The prevalence of pathogens detected in cases and controls will be compared, the OR of detection and population attributable fraction to CAP for each pathogen will be determined; relationships between pathogen load and disease status and severity will be explored. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the human research ethics committees of PMH, Perth, Australia (PMH HREC REF 2014117EP). Findings will be disseminated at research conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.","publish_time":"2018-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhuiyan, Mejbah Uddin; Snelling, Thomas L; West, Rachel; Lang, Jurissa; Rahman, Tasmina; Borland, Meredith L; Thornton, Ruth; Kirkham, Lea-Ann; Sikazwe, Chisha; Martin, Andrew C; Richmond, Peter C; Smith, David W; Jaffe, Adam; Blyth, Christopher C","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23fcb75440f439f30f656e0c6b47c6f565f32ef2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/34d485e6c776b7e4e28bab88bdd133aa4d43e4b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5857668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549211/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020646","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMH","PCR"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["confirmed pneumonia","healthy children","asymptomatic children","childhood CAP","cases","overall burden of bacterial pneumonia","viral aetiology of pneumonia","controls","childhood community","pathogen load","primary pathogens","prevalence of pathogens","respiratory pathogens","PMH outpatient clinics","introduction of pneumococcal vaccines","Australia","PMH HREC REF","human research ethics committees of PMH","developed countries","presence of viruses","contribution of bacteria","control study","leading cause of childhood morbidity","multivalent pneumococcal vaccines","secondary bacterial infection","local community immunisation clinics","research conferences","true contribution","prospective case","quantitative PCR","control ratio","Perth","conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B","Princess Margaret Hospital","PneumoWA","development of effective diagnosis","treatment","disease status","comprehensive studies","relationships","population attributable fraction","preventive strategies","detection","severity","mortality","EP","peer-reviewed journals","availability of molecular diagnostics","ANALYSIS","Findings","Nasopharyngeal swabs","DISSEMINATION","METHODS","arm"],"language":"en"},

However, sensitivities of tests in routine use are unsatisfactory, due to the characteristically low parasitaemias in naturally infected individuals. We have identified a conserved sequence in the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) of the sub-genus Trypanozoon and used it to design primers for a highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The test was used to analyse Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples from HAT patients. The RIME LAMP assay was performed at 62\u00B0C using real-time PCR and a water bath. DNA amplification was detectable within 25min. All positive samples detected by gel electrophoresis or in real-time using SYTO-9 fluorescence dye could also be detected visually by addition of SYBR Green I to the product. The amplicon was unequivocally confirmed through restriction enzyme NdeI digestion, analysis of melt curves and sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the RIME LAMP assay was equivalent to 0.001 trypanosomes/ml while that of classical PCR tests ranged from 0.1 to 1000 trypanosomes/ml. LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates while TBR1 and two primers (specific for sub-genus Trypanozoon) showed a sensitivity of 86.9%. The SRA gene PCR detected 21 out of 40 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates while Trypanosoma gambiense-specific glycoprotein primers (TgsGP) detected 11 out of 13 T. b. gambiense isolates. Using clinical samples, the LAMP test detected parasite DNA in 18 out of 20 samples which included using supernatant prepared from boiled blood, CSF and direct native serum. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the LAMP assay coupled with the ability to detect the results visually without the need for sophisticated equipment indicate that the technique has strong potential for detection of HAT in clinical settings. Since the LAMP test shows a high tolerance to different biological substances, determination of the appropriate protocols for processing the template to make it a user-friendly technique, prior to large scale evaluation, is needed.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Njiru, Z.

Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. METHODS: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown \u03B2-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor. CONCLUSION: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Li-Li; Wang, Ye-Ming; Wu, Zhi-Qiang; Xiang, Zi-Chun; Guo, Li; Xu, Teng; Jiang, Yong-Zhong; Xiong, Yan; Li, Yong-Jun; Li, Xing-Wang; Li, Hui; Fan, Guo-Hui; Gu, Xiao-Ying; Xiao, Yan; Gao, Hong; Xu, Jiu-Yang; Yang, Fan; Wang, Xin-Ming; Wu, Chao; Chen, Lan; Liu, Yi-Wei; Liu, Bo; Yang, Jian; Wang, Xiao-Rui; Dong, Jie; Li, Li; Huang, Chao-Lin; Zhao, Jian-Ping; Hu, Yi; Cheng, Zhen-Shun; Liu, Lin-Lin; Qian, Zhao-Hui; Qin, Chuan; Jin, Qi; Cao, Bin; Wang, Jian-Wei","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4f38656b672b4a4821a5d12ebfe78dc51fc2ba0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147275.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32004165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","novel bat-origin CoV","sequence of SARS","bat SARS","patients","severe acute respiratory syndrome","severe pneumonia","unknown \u03B2-CoV strain","sequence of MERS","Sequence results","nucleotide identity","indicator of bat","GenBank NC","fatal respiratory disease","Middle East respiratory syndrome","complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome","fatal pneumonia","origin CoVs","BAL","amino acid sequence","GenBank MG772933","humans","nucleotide identities","isolates","Virus isolation","tentative receptor-binding domain","Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan","single intact open reading frame gene","specimens","zoonotic coronaviruses","Hubei province","clinical data","bronchoalveolar lavage","Human infections","dyspnea","SL-ZC45","Chest radiography","diffuse opacities","consolidation","BACKGROUND","presence","great public health concern","maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees","cough","China","fever","METHODS","Nucleic acids","CONCLUSION","separate clade","generation sequencing"],"language":"en"},

There are three types of envelope proteins each exhibiting distinct structure folds. Although the exact fusion mechanism remains elusive, it was suggested that the three classes of viral fusion proteins share a similar mechanism of membrane fusion. The common mechanism of action makes it possible to correlate the properties of self-derived peptide inhibitors with their activities. Here we developed a support vector machine model using sequence-based statistical scores of self-derived peptide inhibitors as input features to correlate with their activities. The model displayed 92% prediction accuracy with the Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.84, obviously superior to those using physicochemical properties and amino acid decomposition as input.

A \u201Ctrademark\u201D of infection is the quick and efficient immuno-suppression mediated in part by a 3\u2019-5\u2019 RNA exonuclease domain (ExoN) of the Nucleoprotein (NP). Mopeia virus, the eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus, carries such ExoN domain, but does not suppress the host innate immunity. We have recently reported the crystal structure of the Mopeia virus ExoN domain, which presents a conserved fold and active site. In the present study, we show that the ExoN activity rules out a direct link between ExoN activity and alteration of the host innate immunity. We found that the Arenavirus ExoN, however, is able to excise mis-incorporated bases present at the 3\u2019-end of double stranded RNA. ExoN(-) arenaviruses cultured in cells dampened in innate immunity still replicated in spite of a significant reduction in the viral charge over several passages. The remaining ExoN(-) virus population showed an increased base substitution rate on a narrow nucleotide spectrum, linking the ExoN activity to genome editing. Since, the Arenavirus ExoN belongs to the same nuclease family as that of the nsp14 coronavirus ExoN; which has been recently shown to promote viral RNA synthesis proofreading; we propose that Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a \u201Climited RNA editing\u201D mechanism mainly controlled by structural constraints and a low mutational/fitness ratio. Author summary Only Arenaviridae and Coronaviridae encode a 3\u2019-5\u2019 RNA exonuclease domain (ExoN) in their genome. This activity is either used to counteract the innate immunity response during viral infection or to ensure genome stability during replication. Mopeia virus (MOPV), the eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus, carries such ExoN domain, but does not suppress the host innate immunity. We studied MOPV ExoN activity both in vitro and in cellula to assess the role of ExoN MOPV and found that the Arenaviral ExoN is fully active on dsRNA, and is able like the one of Coronaviridae to excise a mismatched base. We measured genetic stability and found evidence of a limited spectrum of RNA synthesis proofreading mechanism, together with a strongly impacted viral replication. We propose that the Arenaviral ExoN is involved in a functional check of the conserved RNA structures of the viral genome.","publish_time":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yekwa, Elsie; Aphibanthammakit, Chutima; Carnec, Xavier; Picard, Caroline; Canard, Bruno; Baize, Sylvain; Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2064e9077b3ef47c6138376115923cee7fcc9cd0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f339a22cebc1bc0099beb7aea41be09cc916e5dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/541698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MOPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Arenavirus ExoN","Arenaviral ExoN","remaining ExoN","MOPV ExoN activity","Mopeia virus ExoN domain","ExoN activity rules","role of ExoN MOPV","nsp14 coronavirus ExoN","RNA exonuclease domain","viral genome","host innate immunity","viral RNA synthesis proofreading","limited RNA editing","innate immunity response","virus population","viral infection","viral replication","conserved RNA structures","limited spectrum of RNA synthesis","viral charge","genome stability","genome editing","eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus","end of double stranded RNA","mechanism","Arenaviridae","Coronaviridae","significant reduction","conserved fold","nuclease family","mismatched base","active site","genetic stability","present study","narrow nucleotide spectrum","large family of viruses","significant public health concerns","increased base substitution rate","mis-incorporated bases present","direct link","alteration","persistent infections","functional check","afflicted regions","structural constraints","evidence","crystal structure","spite","dsRNA","efficient immuno-suppression","cellula","fitness ratio","Author summary","cells","arenaviruses","Nucleoprotein","trademark","passages","NP"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To estimate adherence to prophylactic antiviral medication for a full influenza season, to the compare efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis to that of the seasonal influenza vaccine and to identify exposures that increase risk of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in healthy adults. METHODS: Participants were randomized 1:2 to receive the 2008\u20132009 influenza vaccine or daily prophylaxis with 10 mg of zanamivir during the season. Web-based questionnaires collected information on demographics, symptoms, exposures, medication use and side effects. RESULTS: Sixty-four healthy adults were recruited in November 2008. Three of 40 active participants discontinued zanamivir due to side effects; the remaining 37 took \u003E85% of scheduled doses for a median of 121 days. Symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza was detected in one person randomized to zanamivir (2\u00B75%) and 2/20 (10%) who received the vaccine (P = 0\u00B725). Forty-seven participants reported 109 episodes of ARI. Factors associated with an ARI were exposure to a spouse (OR 7\u00B72), child (OR 2\u00B74) or patient (OR 2\u00B70) with symptoms of an ARI in the previous 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough influenza infection occurred in both vaccinated participants and those receiving antiviral prophylaxis. Most adults were willing and able to comply with season-long prophylaxis. Report of recent exposure to family members and patients with an ARI increased the risk of developing an ARI in healthy adults.","publish_time":"2015-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coleman, Brenda L; Fadel, Shaza A; Drews, Steven J; Hatchette, Todd F; McGeer, Allison J","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca13097c0bc4ca9abed010fa69c56531749da4dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4353320.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza season","healthy adults","episodes of ARI","seasonal influenza vaccine","working adults","zanamivir","season-long prophylaxis","daily prophylaxis","vaccinated participants","active participants","Breakthrough influenza infection","compare efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis","exposures","symptoms","prophylactic antiviral medication","effects","days","risk of acute respiratory illnesses","medication use","respiratory viral infections","Report of recent exposure","information","demographics","family members","patients","effectiveness of different preventive measures","people","great importance","Web-based questionnaires","adherence","Healthcare workers","median","CONCLUSIONS","spouse","scheduled doses","BACKGROUND","child","OBJECTIVES","laboratory","Factors","RESULTS","person","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS: This review describes the attributes shared by both cancer-derived EVs, with an emphasis on breast cancer-derived EVs, and enveloped viral particles and discusses the methods by which virions can utilize the EV pathway as a means of transferring viral material and oncogenes to host cells. Additionally, the possible links between human papilloma virus and its influence on the miRNA content of breast cancer-derived EVs are examined.

The algorithm was designed to target antimicrobial therapy in systemically ill calves from on two dairy farms. Retrospective (farm 1: 529 calves; farm 2: 639 calves) and prospective (farm 1: 639 calves; farm 2: 842 calves) cohorts were examined for 12 months before and after implementation of the algorithm. The Mantel\u2013Haenszel test and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were used to assess the cumulative incidence risk (CIR) and time to development of each outcome before and after implementation of the algorithm. The CIR of antimicrobial treatment rates was 80% lower after implementation of the algorithm on both farms (CIR 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.17\u20130.21). There was no difference in the CIR of overall mortality, but the CRI for mortality of diarrhoeic calves was lower in the period after implementation of the algorithm on one farm. The faecal microbiota of 15 healthy calves from both farms at each time period were characterised using a sequencing platform targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. On both farms, there were significant differences in community membership and structure (parsimony P\u003C 0.001). Use of the algorithm for treatment of diarrhoeic calves reduced antimicrobial treatment rates without a negative impact on the health of calves.

In some cases, outbreaks of these diseases in populations of fish can lead to the near extinction of a particular race of sockeye salmon or such severe losses as to put commercial aquaculture ventures out of business. The importance of fish viruses to the aquaculture industry has increased the number of reported new virus isolations and the host range of previously characterized viruses. Currently, the fish viruses are represented in 14 of the families listed for vertebrate viruses by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. The fish viruses containing DNA genomes are listed in the families Iridoviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesvirdae and those with RNA genomes are listed in the families Picornaviridae, Birnaviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Caliciviridae, Togaviridae, Nodaviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae. Many of these viruses have grown optimally at the temperature of the host (8\u201315 \u00B0C). A few of the viruses can cross the species barrier and infect other fish species, cattle, pigs, and humans. As the need of aquacultured fish grows and the industry brings into culture more diverse species of fish, it is likely that there will be new virus isolations and some will be subsequently classified as new genera or even families.","publish_time":"2008-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leong, J.C.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149611.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104004003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104004003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importance of fish viruses","fish species","farmed fish","populations of fish","vertebrate viruses","Taxonomy of Viruses","characterized viruses","diverse species of fish","need of aquacultured fish","families Picornaviridae","families Iridoviridae","new virus isolations","aquaculture industry","species barrier","new genera","host range","commercial aquaculture","DNA genomes","RNA genomes","Caliciviridae","Paramyxoviridae","Orthomyxoviridae","Rhabdoviridae","Reoviridae","particular race of sockeye salmon","severe losses","Nodaviridae","Togaviridae","Birnaviridae","Herpesvirdae","International Committee","number","Viral pathogens impact","near extinction","Retroviridae","diseases","cattle","pigs","outbreaks","Adenoviridae","cases","Coronaviridae","humans","business","temperature"],"language":"en"},

A smoke tracer was introduced into one of the lungs of the model to enable it to mix with the incoming oxygen and then to be further inhaled/exhaled by the model according to a variety of realistic respiratory settings (14, 24, and 30 breaths per minute, with tidal volumes of 500, 330, 235 mL, respectively) and oxygen supply flow rates (between 6 and 15 liters per minute). Digital recordings of these exhaled airflow patterns allowed approximate distances to be estimated for the extent of the visible exhaled air plumes emitted from each oxygen mask type at these settings.

In the case of zoonoses emerging from livestock, one of the most significant changes that has taken place since the mid twentieth century is what has been termed the \u201Clivestock revolution\u201D, whereby the stock of food animals, their productivity and their trade has increased rapidly to feed rising and increasingly wealthy and urbanized populations. Further increases are projected in the future in low and middle-income countries. Using avian influenza as an example, we discuss how the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 in China was linked to rapid intensification of the poultry sector taking place in landscapes rich in wetland agriculture and wild waterfowls habitats, providing an extensive interface with the wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Trade networks and live-poultry markets further exacerbated the spread and persistence of avian influenza as well as human exposure. However, as the history of emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) demonstrates in high-income countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, this is by no way specific to low and middle-income countries. Many HPAI emergence events took place in countries with generally good biosecurity standards, and the majority of these in regions hosting intensive poultry production systems. Emerging zoonoses are only one of a number of externalities of intensive livestock production systems, alongside antimicrobial consumption, disruption of nutrient cycles and greenhouse gases emissions, with direct or indirect impacts on human health. In parallel, livestock production is essential to nutrition and livelihoods in many low-income countries.

It is irreversible, and ultimately fatal. Though this disease was first described in the 1920s, its causes have been a mystery and a source of much academic and clinical contention. Possible etiologic agents that have been explored include exposure to metals and metalloids, viruses and bacteria, and the environmental toxins aristolochic acid (AA) and ochratoxin A (OTA). Aristolochic acid is a toxin produced by weeds of the genus Aristolochia, common in Balkan wheat fields. Aristolochia seeds may intermingle with harvested grains and thus inadvertently enter human diets. Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin (fungal toxin) common in many foods, including cereal grains. In this study, we analyzed the weight of evidence for each of the suspected causes of BEN using the Bradford Hill Criteria (BHC): nine conditions that determine weight of evidence for a causal relationship between an agent and a disease. Each agent postulated to cause BEN was evaluated using the nine criteria, and for each criterion was given a rating based on the strength of the association between exposure to the substance and BEN. From the overall available scientific evidence for each of these suspected risk factors, aristolochic acid is the agent with the greatest weight of evidence in causing BEN. We describe other methods for testing causality from epidemiological studies, which support this conclusion of AA causing BEN.","publish_time":"2014-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bui-Klimke, Travis; Wu, Felicia","journal":"Risk Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0af911bd4b407733766751b20be2aec6e09e007.json; document_parses/pdf_json/571c374a369ea8ce0c85cd3b11fa62d8d4b499d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4199864.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954501/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4199864?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aristolochic","BEN"],"organizations":["Balkan Endemic Nephropathy","Bradford Hill Criteria"],"locations":["Balkan","Serbia","Bulgaria","Romania"],"keyphrases":["suspected causes of BEN","greatest weight of evidence","environmental toxins aristolochic acid","Balkan Endemic Nephropathy","exposure","ochratoxin","overall available scientific evidence","Balkan nations Croatia","Balkan wheat fields","progressive wasting disease","genus Aristolochia","fungal toxin","Aristolochia seeds","conclusion of AA","harvested grains","cereal grains","suspected risk factors","Bradford Hill Criteria","kidneys","certain rural regions","bacteria","epidemiological studies","viruses","Serbia","Bulgaria","foods","weeds","causal relationship","source","methods","testing causality","metals","metalloids","BHC","mycotoxin","conditions","clinical contention","strength","association","mystery","substance","human diets","Possible etiologic agents","rating","Romania","criterion","OTA","study"],"language":"en"},

The disease can be very debilitating with vision loss, motor and sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The clinical course may present as a relapsing\u2010remitting disease course, a progressive disease course, or a combination thereof. The etiology of MS is unknown. Though many viruses have been shown to be associated with MS, no one virus has ever been demonstrated to be the cause of MS. In addition, MS is thought to have an autoimmune component. Molecular mimicry is one hypothesis put forth which could reconcile the diverse pathology and etiology of MS. Molecular mimicry occurs when peptides from pathogens share sequence or structural similarities with self\u2010antigens. Infection with various pathogens, each with its individual molecular mimic to a CNS antigen, may explain the inability of investigators to link one specific virus to MS. Molecular mimicry may be mediated through human leukocyte antigen class I\u2010 and class II\u2010restricted T cells and antibodies, which may explain the diversity in phenotype. Aspects of molecular mimicry will be discussed in relation to each of these immune system components. Examples of various molecular mimics will be discussed with a particular focus on the CNS and MS. Molecular mimicry alone may not be able to induce disease; priming of the immune system by infection with a pathogen that carries a molecular mimic to self may have to be followed by a later nonspecific immunologic challenge in order for disease to be initiated. Recent research into this priming and triggering of disease will be discussed in relation to an animal model for MS.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Libbey, Jane E.; McCoy, Lori L.; Fujinami, Robert S.","journal":"International Review of Neurobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d5f1ba26f1c1c7d7668715849f7bd1b296bf7f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127675.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0074774207790062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774207790062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aspects of molecular mimicry","individual molecular mimic","progressive disease course","Examples of various molecular mimics","etiology of MS","CNS antigen","various pathogens","immune system components","clinical course","relation","Infection","human leukocyte antigen class","specific virus","common demyelinating central nervous system","diseases","sensory disturbances","motor","sequence","humans","structural similarities","vision loss","peptides","multiple sclerosis","antibodies","self\u2010antigens","restricted T cells","nonspecific immunologic challenge","order","relapsing","cognitive impairment","inability of investigators","diverse pathology","particular focus","combination","diversity","Recent research","animal model","cause of","addition","hypothesis","autoimmune component","phenotype","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, analysis of the spike gene has been used to determine phylogenetic relationships between PEDV strains. We determined the complete genomes of 93 PEDV field samples from US swine and analyzed the data in conjunction with complete genome sequences available from GenBank (n =126) to determine the most variable genomic areas. Our results indicate high levels of variation within the ORF1 and spike regions while the C-terminal domains of structural genes were highly conserved. Analysis of the Receptor Binding Domains in the spike gene revealed a limited number of amino acid substitutions in US strains compared to Asian strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence data revealed high rates of recombination, resulting in differing evolutionary patterns in phylogenies inferred for the spike region versus whole genomes. These finding suggest that significant genetic events outside of the spike region have contributed to the evolution of PEDV.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarvis, Matthew C.; Lam, Ham Ching; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Leyi; Hesse, Richard A.; Hause, Ben M.; Vlasova, Anastasia; Wang, Qiuhong; Zhang, Jianqiang; Nelson, Martha I.; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Marthaler, Douglas","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc6e9b9c9d5f27c0f6035c3011603426a1674617.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114344.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26611651/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.10.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States","Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["spike gene","PEDV strains","spike regions","US strains","complete genomes","evolution of PEDV","Phylogenetic analysis","complete genome sequence data","US swine","PEDV field samples","Asian strains","complete genome sequences available","phylogenetic relationships","high rates of recombination","Receptor Binding Domains","high levels of variation","C-terminal domains of structural genes","limited number of amino acid substitutions","ORF1","conjunction","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","GenBank","phylogenies","differing evolutionary patterns","significant genetic events","severe economic losses","United States","finding","results","variable genomic areas","Europe"],"language":"en"},

However, the GVI-1 viruses exhibited variable antigenicity when compared to each other. Further analysis found that strains CO8089L and CO8091L, which were isolated in Colombia in 2003, were closely related to GVI-1 viruses, suggesting that GVI-1 viruses likely originated from Colombia and are prevalent in at least five countries (Colombia, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). Analysis of the complete GVI-1 virus genomes suggested that the GVI-1 strains in China may be independently derived from recombination events that occurred between GI-19 strains and CO8089L/CO8091L-like viruses following the introduction of the viruses from Colombia. Similar to the viruses isolated in the Republic of Korea, GVI-1 viruses isolated in China also showed an affinity for the respiratory tract of chickens, which differed from one of the deduced parental viruses, the GI-19 strain. This difference may be due to recombination events that occurred in the genomes of the GVI-1 viruses, resulting in the replacement of the spike gene sequences in an YX10-like strain of GI-19 lineage.","publish_time":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Mengting; Sheng, Jie; Ma, Tianxin; Xu, Liwen; Han, Zongxi; Li, Huixin; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b4531910c62f5280ea1682f6f51db369da61167.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185777.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134819301637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819301637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255833/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.103942","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GVI"],"locations":["Republic","Japan","Vietnam","Colombia","China"],"keyphrases":["IBV GVI","complete GVI","deduced parental viruses","S1 gene sequences of GVI","Colombia","China","strains CO8089L","strain of GI","virus genomes","CO8091L","Republic of Korea","known IBV genotypes","lineages","recombination events","analysis","spike gene sequences","established genotypes","infectious bronchitis virus","thorough comparison","YX10","TC07","affinity","replacement","introduction","respiratory tract of chickens","present study","Japan","countries","variable antigenicity","Vietnam","difference","novel genotype","linage"],"language":"en"},

Alternaria alternata is an ascomycete fungus that causes leaf spot diseases on various crop plants. In this study, we identified a novel ssRNA mycovirus infecting an A. alternata f. sp. mali strain isolated from an apple orchard in China. Sequence analyses revealed that this virus is related to hypoviruses, in particular to Wuhan insect virus 14, an unclassified hypovirus identified from insect meta-transcriptomics, as well as other hypoviruses belonging to the genus Hypovirus, and therefore this virus is designed as Alternaria alternata hypovirus 1 (AaHV1). The genome of AaHV1 contains a single large open-reading frame encoding a putative polyprotein (\u223C479 kDa) with a cysteine proteinase-like and replication-associated domains. Curing AaHV1 from the fungal host strain indicated that the virus is responsible for the slow growth and reduced virulence of the host. AaHV1 defective RNA (D-RNA) with internal deletions emerging during fungal subcultures but the presence of D-RNA does not affect AaHV1 accumulation and pathogenicities. Moreover, AaHV1 could replicate and confer hypovirulence in Botryosphaeria dothidea, a fungal pathogen of apple white rot disease. This finding could facilitate better understanding of A. alternata pathogenicity and is relevant for development of biocontrol methods of fungal diseases.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Huan; Bian, Ruiling; Liu, Qian; Yang, Liu; Pang, Tianxing; Salaipeth, Lakha; Andika, Ida Bagus; Kondo, Hideki; Sun, Liying","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2748111c3683cdd338b098c0b5d2aa6becfc0fee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6530530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["genome of AaHV1","AaHV1 accumulation","AaHV1 defective RNA","fungal subcultures","fungal hosts","fungal host strain","Alternaria alternata hypovirus","D-RNA","alternata pathogenicity","Wuhan insect virus","development of biocontrol methods of fungal diseases","unclassified hypovirus","genus Hypovirus","hypoviruses","fungal pathogen of apple white rot disease","slow growth","presence of D","apple orchard","reduced virulence","mali strain","leaf spot diseases","insect meta-transcriptomics","small number of mycoviruses","ascomycete fungus","frame","various crop plants","internal deletions","Botryosphaeria dothidea","kDa","groups of fungi","better understanding of","hypovirulence","novel ssRNA mycovirus","cysteine proteinase","putative polyprotein","wide spread","replication-associated domains","study","finding","China","Sequence analyses","pathogenicities"],"language":"en"},

Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS. Its pathogenesis is based on a novel \u201Ctwo-path unifying theory\u201D of hemostasis and \u201Ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201D promoting molecular pathogenesis. Endotheliopathy activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. The former triggers the release inflammatory cytokines and the latter promotes exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) and platelet activation. Inflammatory pathway initiates inflammation, but microthrombotic pathway more seriously produces \u201Cmicrothrombi strings\u201D composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes, which become anchored on the injured endothelial cells, and causes disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT). DIT is a hemostatic disease due to lone activation of ULVWF path without activated tissue factor path. It leads to endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), which orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and MODS. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome is the hematologic phenotype of EA-VMTD. ARDS is one of organ phenotypes among MODS associated with TTP-like syndrome. The most effective treatment of ARDS can be achieved by counteracting the activated microthrombotic pathway based on two novel hemostatic theories.","publish_time":"2019-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Jae C.","journal":"Clin Appl Thromb Hemost","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c439e1028bc93d94f4eba1855c6b1eade676f732.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775524/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029619887437","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAC","ARDS","DIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vascular microthrombotic disease","pulmonary vascular microthrombosis","MODS","activated microthrombotic pathway","endotheliopathy","platelet activation","activation theory","lone activation of ULVWF path","pulmonary vascular injury","collagen vascular disease","Inflammatory pathway initiates inflammation","hemostatic disease","multi-organ dysfunction syndrome","endothelial CD59","platelet-ULVWF complexes","tissue factor path","MAC","EA-VMTD","severe inflammation","TTP","effective treatment of ARDS","causes","molecular pathogenesis","DIT","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","progressive pulmonary hypoxia","injured endothelial cells","release inflammatory cytokines","novel hemostatic theories","organ phenotypes","immune response","intravascular microthrombosis","innocent bystander endothelial cell of host","Willebrand factor multimers","independent molecular pathways","hematologic phenotype of EA","lungs","insult","trauma","life-threatening noncardiogenic circulatory disorder","consumptive thrombocytopenia","microangiopathic hemolytic anemia","exocytosis","membrane attack complex","critical illnesses","sepsis","microthrombi strings","endothelium","hemostasis","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","triggers","regulatory protein","demise","best supportive care","mortality rate","microbes"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We sought to summarize the current telemedicine environment in order to highlight the important changes triggered by the novel coronavirus pandemic, as well as highlight how the current crisis may inform the future of telemedicine. RESULTS: At many institutions, the number of telemedicine visits dramatically increased within days following the institution of novel coronavirus pandemic restrictions on in-person clinical encounters. Prior to the pandemic, telemedicine utilization was weak throughout surgical specialties due to regulatory and reimbursement barriers. As part of the pandemic response, the USA government temporarily relaxed various telemedicine restrictions and provided additional telemedicine funding.

During this outbreak, in addition to fever, rash and arthritis, severe cases of CHIKV infection have been observed in infants. Challenging the notion that the innate immune response in infants is immature or defective, we demonstrate that both human infants and neonatal mice generate a robust type I interferon (IFN) response during CHIKV infection that contributes to, but is insufficient for, the complete control of infection. To characterize the mechanism by which type I IFNs control CHIKV infection, we evaluated the role of ISG15 and defined it as a central player in the host response, as neonatal mice lacking ISG15 were profoundly susceptible to CHIKV infection. Surprisingly, UbE1L(\u2212/\u2212) mice, which lack the ISG15 E1 enzyme and therefore are unable to form ISG15 conjugates, displayed no increase in lethality following CHIKV infection, thus pointing to a non-classical role for ISG15. No differences in viral loads were observed between wild-type (WT) and ISG15(\u2212/\u2212) mice, however, a dramatic increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was observed in ISG15(\u2212/\u2212) mice, suggesting that the innate immune response to CHIKV contributes to their lethality. This study provides new insight into the control of CHIKV infection, and establishes a new model for how ISG15 functions as an immunomodulatory molecule in the blunting of potentially pathologic levels of innate effector molecules during the host response to viral infection.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Werneke, Scott W.; Schilte, Clementine; Rohatgi, Anjali; Monte, Kristen J.; Michault, Alain; Arenzana-Seisdedos, Fernando; Vanlandingham, Dana L.; Higgs, Stephen; Fontanet, Arnaud; Albert, Matthew L.; Lenschow, Deborah J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9b6f3ff358477fe654fa5e92b3fb85ebd3fb8a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3197620.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22028657/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":["Indian Ocean"],"keyphrases":["control of CHIKV infection","IFNs control CHIKV infection","viral infection","role of ISG15","severe cases of CHIKV infection","ISG15 functions","ISG15 conjugates","complete control of infection","host response","neonatal mice","innate immune response","ISG15 E1 enzyme","robust type","human infants","wild-type","lethality","dramatic increase","new insight","new model","viral loads","pathologic levels of innate effector molecules","non-classical role","arthritis","significant disease","interferon","fever","rash","blunting","chemokines","proinflammatory cytokines","immunomodulatory molecule","re-emerging alphavirus","Indian Ocean region","addition","central player","study","WT","notion","Chikungunya virus","outbreak","differences","mechanism","UbE1L"],"language":"en"},

The different microarray and NGS platforms have advantages and drawbacks and all require further improvements in terms of data accuracy. They require powerful software solutions to analyze the tremendous amounts of data they generate. Many companies specialized in technologies for genomics analysis have been created since the beginning of the 1990s, many of them as small biotech companies exploiting patents from renowned Universities. Most of them have now been acquired by major in vitro diagnostic companies. Currently, their sales are mostly to research institutes.

Here we investigated the challenges faced by polypeptide segments of a non-vectorial \u03B2-barrel fold. Besides the biological interest behind the SARS coronavirus non-structural protein 1 (nsp1, 117 amino acids), this study model has two structural features that motivated its use in this work: 1- its recombinant production is dependent on the temperature, with greater solubility when expressed at low temperatures. This is an indication of the cotranslational guidance to the native protein conformation. 2- Conversely, nsp1 has a six-stranded, mixed parallel/antiparallel \u03B2-barrel with intricate long-range interactions, indicating it will need the full-length protein to fold properly. We used non-denaturing purification conditions that allowed the characterization of polypeptide chains of different lengths, mimicking the landscape of the cotranslational fold of a \u03B2-barrel, and avoiding the major technical hindrances of working with the nascent polypeptide bound to the ribosome. Our results showed partially folded states formed as soon as the amino acids of the second \u03B2-strand were present (55 amino acids). These partially folded states are different based on the length of polypeptide chain. The native \u03B1-helix (amino acids 24\u201337) was identified as a transient structure (~20\u201330% propensity). We identified the presence of regular secondary structure after the fourth native \u03B2-strand is present (89 amino acids), in parallel to the collapse to a non-native 3D structure. Interestingly the polypeptide sequences of the native strands \u03B22, \u03B23 and \u03B24 have characteristics of \u03B1-helices. Our comprehensive analyses support the idea that incomplete polypeptide chains, such as the ones of nascent proteins much earlier than the end of the translation, adopt an abundance of specific transient folds, instead of disordered conformations.","publish_time":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vazquez, Leonardo; e Lima, Luis Mauricio Trambaioli da Rocha; Almeida, Marcius da Silva","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de836dc0077e520bc97ba60c40fab7a6af4d8224.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5531528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28750053/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182132","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amino acids","nascent polypeptide","polypeptide segments","polypeptide sequences","native \u03B2-strand","incomplete polypeptide chains","antiparallel \u03B2-barrel","length of polypeptide chain","non-vectorial \u03B2-barrel fold","native protein conformation","characterization of polypeptide chains of different lengths","transient structure","native \u03B1-helix","native strands \u03B22","cotranslational guidance","D structure","folded states","cotranslational folding","nsp1","characteristics of \u03B1","SARS coronavirus non-structural protein","presence of regular secondary structure","ones of nascent proteins","non-denaturing purification conditions","abundance of specific transient folds","\u03B24","\u03B23","idea","study model","greater solubility","recombinant production","structural features","collapse","landscape","major technical hindrances","disordered conformations","comprehensive analyses","work","use","low temperatures","end","helices","completion","interactions","cooperative process","indication","results","domain","challenges","ribosome","propensity"],"language":"en"},

To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. RECENT FINDINGS: The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors. Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor. Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases. Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03B1) were increased in severe patients. These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation. SUMMARY: Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out. Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crisci, Carlos D.; Ardusso, Ledit R.

CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 215,461 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic. International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the natural history of this worldwide problem.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rom\u00E1n, Gustavo C.; Spencer, Peter S.; Reis, Jacques; Buguet, Alain; Faris, Mostafa El Alaoui; Katrak, Sarosh M.; L\u00E1inez, Miguel; Medina, Marco Tulio; Meshram, Chandrashekhar; Mizusawa, Hidehiro; \u00D6zt\u00FCrk, Serefnur; Wasay, Mohammad","journal":"J Neurol Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204734.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302203; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302203?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116884","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Miller Fisher"],"organizations":["CNS","PNS","World Federation of Neurology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurological manifestations","neurological disorders","neurological diseases","neurology of COVID","CNS manifestations","current COVID","regional neurological associations","viral attachment","lethal manifestation of COVID","PNS","muscle","initial indicators of potential neurological involvement","Miller Fisher syndrome","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","peripheral nervous system","central nervous system","frontal hypoperfusion syndrome","rare instances of viral myopathy","intracerebral hemorrhage","subarachnoid hemorrhage","viral invasion of cranial nerve","Respiratory failure","comprehensive review","on-going pandemic","worldwide problem","frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection","cerebral venous thrombosis","World Federation of Neurology","brainstem respiratory centers","Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy","endothelium","polyneuritis cranialis","decreased responsiveness","widespread endotheliitis","ACE2 receptors","local databases","dysgeusia","hypogeusia","hyposmia","anosmia","headache","particular large-vessel ischemic strokes","rhinencephalon","meningitis","coagulopathy","natural history","encephalitis","isolated reports of seizures","rhabdomyolysis","pressing need","frequency","cases","Cerebrovascular disease","thrombotic state","SARS-CoV","International neuroepidemiological collaboration","behalf","neuropathology","pathogenesis","main conclusion","cytokine storm","deaths","myelitis"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. STUDY SELECTION: Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: By the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201Csmall-molecule\u201D drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 years or more. Strict manufacturing regulations and facility upgrades add to these costs. Policy options to increase and stabilize the supply of vaccines include those aimed at increasing supply, such as government subsidies for basic vaccine research, liability protection for manufacturers, and fast-track approval for new vaccines. Options to increase vaccine demand include advance purchase commitments, government stockpiles, and government financing for select populations. CONCLUSION: High development costs and multiple barriers to entry have led to a decline in the number of vaccine manufacturers. Although a number of vaccine policies have met with mixed success in increasing the supply of and demand for vaccines, a variety of concerns remain, including developing vaccines for complex pathogens and increasing immunization rates with available vaccines. New policy innovations such as advance market commitments and Medicare Part D vaccine coverage have been implemented and may aid in resolving some of the problems in the vaccine industry.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muzumdar, Jagannath M.; Cline, Richard R.","journal":"J Am Pharm Assoc (2003)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b90d85915f51ab637584d162d5bd78a7e02cdae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185851.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319115310359; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319115310359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589753/; https://doi.org/10.1331/japha.2009.09007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Pharmaceutical Abstracts"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine demand","supply of vaccines","vaccine industry","policy options","new vaccines","developing vaccines","available vaccines","increasing supply","number of vaccine manufacturers","basic vaccine research","Policy File","number of vaccine policies","public policy","topics of vaccine history","D vaccine coverage","overview of supply","demand issues","New policy innovations","High development costs","government subsidies","government stockpiles","government financing","DATA SOURCES","government agency reports","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA EXTRACTION","advance market commitments","advance purchase commitments","included texts","academic journal articles","liability protection","Medicare","complex pathogens","multiple barriers","immunization rates","International Pharmaceutical Abstracts","Search criteria","English language","facility upgrades","entry","Medline","biologic medications","Strict manufacturing regulations","independent think tanks","CONCLUSION","approval","decline","variety of concerns","mixed success","immunizations","small-molecule","STUDY SELECTION","human studies","production","Keywords","drugs","authors","populations","problems","OBJECTIVE","years","inclusion"],"language":"en"},

Couples\u0027 quality of life and their reproductive desire were evaluated.Results: 1482 respondents were included: 944 women (63.7%) and 538 men (36.3%). A significant trend toward reduced mean wellbeing scores during the quarantine, compared to before, was found (p \u003C .01). From 18.1% participants who were planning to have a child before the pandemic, 37.3% abandoned the intention, related to worries of future economic difficulties (58%) and consequences on pregnancy (58%). Of 81.9% who did not intend to conceive, 11.5% revealed a desire for parenthood during quarantine than before (p \u003C .01), related to will for change (50%) and need for positivity (40%). 4.3% of these actually tried to get pregnant.

Six weeks after immunization, anti-IBV neutralizing titer and anti-S1 ELISA titer were determined; immunized chickens then were inoculated with IBV via the trachea and ciliary activity was observed.

Therefore, early recognition of a viral cause of acute FRI leading to ARDS becomes important for protection of health-care workers (HCWs), lessening spread to other patients, and notification of public health officials. These patients often have longer courses of viral shedding and undergo higher-risk procedures that may potentially generate aerosols, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, bag-valve mask ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and medication nebulization, further illustrating the importance of early detection and isolation. A small number of viral agents lead to acute FRI, respiratory failure, and ARDS: seasonal influenza, avian influenza, coronavirus associated with severe ARDS, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, varicella, human metapneumovirus, and hantavirus. A systematic approach to early isolation, testing for these agents, and public health involvement becomes important in dealing with acute FRI. Ultimately, this approach will lead to improved HCW protection, reduction of transmission to other patients, and prevention of transmission in the community.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sandrock, Christian; Stollenwerk, Nicholas","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a79eda4de7857a7fe88b83a1cc494013c23fc048.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094748.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215517583; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.07-0778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460521/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215517583","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory failure","viral cause of acute","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute FRIs","Acute febrile respiratory illness","viral etiology","Viral pneumonia","severe ARDS","patients","respiratory syncytial virus","protection of health","small number of viral agents","early isolation","Emerging viral infectious diseases","longer courses of viral shedding","avian influenza present","seasonal influenza","public health involvement","early recognition","notification of public health officials","importance of early detection","reduction of transmission","prevention of transmission","systematic approach","improved HCW protection","noninvasive positive pressure ventilation","bag-valve mask ventilation","varicella","adenovirus","coronavirus","bronchoscopy","care workers","testing","medication nebulization","lessening spread","HCWs","common reason","higher-risk procedures","human metapneumovirus","aerosols","intubation","admission","cases","ICU","hantavirus","portion","community"],"language":"en"},

The virus-host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown. To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice. This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models. In contrast, infection of STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively. Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism. In contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that STAT1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation.","publish_time":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frieman, Matthew B.; Chen, Jun; Morrison, Thomas E.; Whitmore, Alan; Funkhouser, William; Ward, Jerrold M.; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Roberts, Anjeanette; Heise, Mark; Subbarao, Kanta; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68ac410cd36c5699f58d2b76b0eeb84956573f77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2851658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20386712/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of type","infection of STAT1","Urbani SARS-CoV infection","infection of wildtype mice","SARS pathogenesis","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","post-infection","disseminated infection","c mice","interferon knockout mice","severe disease","Urbani viruses","contrast","STAT1 dependent","severe end stage lung disease","models of viral pathogenesis","documented role","role of innate immune","mouse models","day","acute end stage lung diseases","clinical disease outcomes","interferon receptor independent","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","alveolar inflammation","alveolar damage","MA15 viruses","recombinant mouse","innate immunity","designated rMA15","high virus titer","virus-host interactions","transient weight loss","denuding bronchiolitis","development","extensive pulmonary lesions","death","phase","BALB","play minor roles","recovery","mortality","human","spleen","protection","liver","background","antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation","tissues","mechanism","findings","elderly","question"],"language":"en"},

For instance, extraordinary shelf life and a chemical stability that allows convenient fridge storage. The origin of the higher stability of LightUp\u00AE probe kits compared to others, based on alternative probe technologies, is partly the relatively good stability of cyanine dyes but also the resistance towards nucleases and proteases of the synthetic DNA analogue peptide nucleic acid that is used as the sequence recognizing element in LightUp probes. It is clear from recent trends in the PCR amplification hardware technology that the instrumentation is becoming more flexible and less adapted for dedicated probe chemistries. This will pave the way for increased standardization in the field of DNA diagnostics and the development of cross-platform assays.

We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.","publish_time":"2010-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turmelle, Amy S.; Olival, Kevin J.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da47cadf1cef48d1fbcac6f6301899a970ccca7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20049506/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-009-0263-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources","IUCN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predictions of viral richness","known viral richness","viral diversity","observed viral species richness","Bats","emergence of viral zoonoses","emerging viral pathogens","population genetic structure correlate","host traits","contemporary host ecology","IUCN status","relative influences of host ecology","relevant reservoir species","sampling effort","associated disease emergence","threat status","independent of phylogeny","evolutionary dynamics","profound impacts","migratory behavior","International Union","virulence","distribution","Conservation of Nature","Natural Resources","body mass","geographic range area","generalized linear regression model framework","vagility","colony size","correction","mechanisms","long-distance dispersal","potential","mammals","evidence","reservoirs","step","hypothesis","associations","colonial populations","study"],"language":"en"},

However, HIV-1 can escape from RNAi-mediated antiviral therapy by selection of mutations in the targeted sequence. To prevent viral escape, multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against conserved viral sequences should be combined. Ideally, these RNA inhibitors should be expressed simultaneously from a single transgene transcript. In this study, we tested a multiplex microRNA (miRNA) expression strategy by inserting multiple effective anti-HIV siRNA sequences in the miRNA polycistron mir-17-92. Individual anti-HIV miRNAs that resemble the natural miRNA structures were optimized by varying the siRNA position in the hairpin stem to obtain maximal effectiveness against luciferase reporters and HIV-1. We show that an antiviral miRNA construct can have a greater intrinsic inhibitory activity than a conventional short hairpin (shRNA) construct. When combined in a polycistron setting, the silencing activity of an individual miRNA is strongly boosted. We demonstrate that HIV-1 replication can be efficiently inhibited by simultaneous expression of four antiviral siRNAs from the polycistronic miRNA transcript. These combined results indicate that a multiplex miRNA strategy may be a promising therapeutic approach to attack escape-prone viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2008-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ying Poi; Haasnoot, Joost; ter Brake, Olivier; Berkhout, Ben; Konstantinova, Pavlina","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6ea09cae9a6185a84ab731e86257d6507f5a102.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2396423.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18346971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual miRNA","antiviral miRNA construct","multiplex miRNA strategy","miRNA polycistron mir","polycistronic miRNA transcript","natural miRNA structures","viral escape","Individual anti-HIV miRNAs","multiple effective anti-HIV siRNA sequences","antiviral siRNAs","expression strategy","conserved viral sequences","antiviral therapy","RNAi","combined results","replication","attack escape-prone viral pathogens","powerful approach","hairpin stem","silencing activity","siRNA position","multiplex microRNA","simultaneous expression","polycistron setting","RNA interference","RNA inhibitors","promising therapeutic approach","conventional short hairpin","single transgene transcript","multiple small interfering RNAs","greater intrinsic inhibitory activity","maximal effectiveness","human immunodeficiency virus type","selection of mutations","luciferase reporters","shRNA","targeted sequence","study"],"language":"en"},

These are Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus and murine hepatitis virus. Both viruses produce acute inflammatory encephalitis that is followed by chronic central-nervous-system (CNS) demyelinating disease. The clinical and pathologic correlates of virus-induced demyelination are largely immune mediated. Furthermore, several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of myelin damage and neurologic deficits, and each of the proposed mechanisms may play a role in disease progression depending on the genetic constitution of the infected animal. The induction of demyelinating disease by virus may be directly relevant to human MS. Several viruses are known to cause demyelination in humans and viral infection is an epidemiologic factor that is consistently associated with clinical exacerbation of MS. It is suggested that viral infection may be a cause of MS, although no specific virus has been identified as a causative agent.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bieber, A.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the strains of FCoV in FIP\u2010affected cats are closely related or genetically distinct from the fecally derived strains of FCoV in contemporary\u2010asymptomatic cats during an epizootic outbreak of FIP. ANIMALS: Four cats euthanized because of FIP and 16 asymptomatic cats. METHODS: This prospective outbreak investigation was initiated during an outbreak of FIP in cats within or rehomed from a rescue/rehoming center. Postmortem samples were collected from cats with FIP and contemporaneous fecal samples from asymptomatic cats. RNA was purified from tissue and fecal samples, FCoV gene fragments were reverse transcribed, PCR\u2010amplified using novel primers, and sequenced. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW and compared with published FCoV sequences. RESULTS: FCoV RNA was detected in all 4 FIP cat postmortem samples and in 9 of the 16 fecal samples from contemporary\u2010asymptomatic cats. Novel primers successfully amplified fragments from 4 regions of the genome for all FCoV\u2010positive samples.

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1\u201359 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41\u00B78% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99\u00B77% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31\u00B77%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10\u00B76\u201397\u00B73%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6\u00B74% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3\u00B72%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33\u00B79%] of 56). Almost all cases (98\u00B79%) and controls (98\u00B70%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61\u00B74% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57\u00B73\u201365\u00B76) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27\u00B73% (23\u00B73\u201331\u00B76) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5\u00B79% (3\u00B79\u20138\u00B73). Viruses were less common (54\u00B75%, 95% CrI 47\u00B74\u201361\u00B75 vs 68\u00B70%, 62\u00B77\u201372\u00B77) and bacteria more common (33\u00B77%, 27\u00B72\u201340\u00B78 vs 22\u00B78%, 18\u00B73\u201327\u00B76) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31\u00B71%, 95% CrI 28\u00B74\u201334\u00B72) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus\u2013enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site\u0027s aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes.

METHODS: This is a qualitative case study conducted at Prince Mohammed International Airport in Almedinah during the 2014 Hajj season, September 2014. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews, focus groups and policy document reviews. Interviews were conducted with the 14 individuals of the airport\u2019s decision makers and relevant health practitioners. Data were recorded via taking notes during interviews and data coding was performed to produce the main themes and subthemes of the study. RESULTS: The main findings of the study revealed three main defects affecting the applied public health emergency system at the airport. The main themes were mainly related to shortage in logistics related to public health emergency systems, shortage in proper documentation of policies and lack of documented protocols of communications among airport stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the main factors hindering the application of public health emergency measures at the airport. A Public Health Emergency Contingency Plan was proposed as a method to regulate the process of providing logistics for public health preventive services, the method of producing documented policies and methods of producing Memoranda of Understandings as communication regulators.","publish_time":"2015-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gosadi, Ibrahim M.; BinSaeed, Abdulaziz; Al-Hazmi, Ali M.; Fadl, Amin A.; Alharbi, Khalid H.; Swarelzahab, Mazin M.","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e9719d2d1a523240172b19f822f7a956c553fdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4568065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-015-1415-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26364051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Ministry of Health","Prince Mohammed International Airport"],"locations":["Almedinah"],"keyphrases":["public health measures","public health emergency systems","Ministry of Health","applied public health emergency system","public health preventive services","application of public health emergency measures","Public Health Emergency Contingency Plan","relevant health practitioners","airport stakeholders","airport workers","provision of preventive health services","main defects","main themes","Prince Mohammed International Airport","main factors","main findings","qualitative case study","shortage","documented policies","Almedinah","logistics","operational defects","METHODS","Hajj season","data coding","semi-structured interviews","proper documentation of policies","appropriate operational solutions","lack of documented protocols of communications","groups","airport\u2019s decision makers","passengers","Memoranda of Understandings","potential gaps","policy document reviews","individuals","notes","process","communication regulators","subthemes","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered September 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The first US case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on 2 May 2014. Methods. We summarize the clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, and MERS-CoV\u2013specific tests. Results. The patient is a 65-year-old physician who worked in a hospital in KSA where MERS-CoV patients were treated. His illness onset included malaise, myalgias, and low-grade fever. He flew to the United States on day of illness (DOI) 7. His first respiratory symptom, a dry cough, developed on DOI 10. On DOI 11, he presented to an Indiana hospital as dyspneic, hypoxic, and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography. On DOI 12, his serum tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for MERS-CoV and showed high MERS-CoV antibody titers, whereas his nasopharyngeal swab was rRT-PCR negative. Expectorated sputum was rRT-PCR positive the following day, with a high viral load (5.31 \u00D7 10(6) copies/mL).

The genome sequence was similar (\u003E99%) to other known MERS-CoV sequences, clustering with those from KSA from June to July 2013. Conclusions. This patient had a prolonged nonspecific prodromal illness before developing respiratory symptoms. Both sera and sputum were rRT-PCR positive when nasopharyngeal specimens were negative.

We present a critical information infrastructure, PriLock, a fully-open preliminary architecture proposal and design draft for privacy preserving contact tracing, which we believe can be constructed in a way to fulfill the former requirements.

Since isolated systems are very rare to find in any context, specially in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers that are interconnected through a fraction $q$ of shared individuals. We model the interactions between individuals in each layer through a weighted network, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered); weights represent the contact times of these interactions and we use a distribution of contact times to assign an individual disorder to each layer. Using branching theory supported by simulations, we study a social distancing strategy where we reduce the average contact time in one layer (or in both of them, if necessary). We find a set of disorder parameters - associated with average contact times - that prevents a disease from becoming an epidemic. When the disease is very likely to spread, the system is always in an epidemic phase, regardless of the disorder parameters and the fraction of shared nodes. However we find that it is still possible to protect a giant component of susceptible individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system composed by the two interconnected layers.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez, I.

In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, many countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from China. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan\u0027s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like \\dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schild, Leonard; Ling, Chen; Blackburn, Jeremy; Stringhini, Gianluca; Zhang, Yang; Zannettou, Savvas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3c57a11b5ecb2c364f50bc938dc39cf593b5d02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04046v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sinophobic"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","Twitter","dissemination of Sinophobic content","outbreak","emergence of new Sinophobic slurs","emergence of Sinophobic behavior","fringe Web communities","disturbing content","Chinese people","attempt","pandemic","time period","shift","China","important differences","interesting differences","rise of Sinophobia","spread of conspiracy theories","hateful speech","specific ethnic groups","countries","chan","regard","information acquisition","communication","lesser extent","dspol","indispensable medium","cross-platform phenomenon","evolution","projected catastrophic consequences","social distancing measures","Incorrect board","mainstream ones","context","words","face","entertainment","lives","large-scale datasets","situation","unprecedented ways","word embeddings","months","paper","virus","conditions"],"language":"en"},

This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t)\u003E1 to R(t)\u003C1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t)\u003C1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t)\u003E1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e2874a4424ba10de42e640eb17cfdb283a4f096.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09403v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan","South Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","quarantine measures","isolation measures","mass quarantine","imposition of quarantine control measures","effective reproduction number R","isolation effective","spread of infection","subsequent stagnation","isolation restrictions","stagnation phase","question","China","public health history","social tool","subsequent increase","strict public health policies","medical tool","forecasting results","epidemiological model driven approach","scientific use","South Korea","machine learning","addition","infected case count","maximum","Iran","Italy","city","sufficient time","month","CoVID","affected countries","immediate relaxation","isolated individuals","crucial role","relapse","end","disease","people","effort"],"language":"en"},

The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities.

Medical imaging such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org. The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings in order to contribute to the growing public database of pathological lung ultrasound images.

We study a setting where ICU resources are constrained while suppression is costly (e.g., limiting economic interaction). Providing a fully analytical solution we show that the common wisdom of\u0022flattening the curve\u0022, where suppression measures are continuously taken to hold down the spread throughout the epidemic, is suboptimal. Instead, the optimal suppression is discontinuous. The epidemic should be left unregulated in a first phase and when the ICU constraint is approaching society should quickly lock down (a discontinuity).

We formulate this as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed method has guaranteed convergence via a proximal splitting algorithm and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In addition, owing to its fast convergence, which takes around 12 seconds for a given frame, our proposed method is readily applicable for processing LUS image sequences.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karakucs, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Aguersif, Amazigh; Silva, Stein; Basarab, Adrian; Achim, Alin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecaf4c20d241aff0637eed56040f25861163d6d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03080v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LUS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed method","novel method","LUS images","line artefacts quantification","vertical line artefacts","current state-of-the-art B-line identification method","images of COVID","known clinical definitions of line artefacts","processing LUS image sequences","inverse Radon","patients","non-convex regularisation problem","fast convergence","image domains","detected B-lines","considerable performance gain","simple local maxima detection technique","sparsity-enforcing","lung ultrasound","comparison","Cauchy-based penalty function","proximal splitting algorithm","given frame","number of false","seconds","stage validation mechanism","order","addition","paper"],"language":"en"},

Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images. However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this, motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19 and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2) the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19 diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great potential for real-world applications.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yifan; Niu, Shuaicheng; Qiu, Zhen; Wei, Ying; Zhao, Peilin; Yao, Jianhua; Huang, Junzhou; Wu, Qingyao; Tan, Mingkui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01577v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID-DA","effectiveness of COVID","small number of COVID","limited availability of annotated COVID","diagnosis of typical pneumonia","domain discrepancy","deep learning","pneumonia datasets","new deep domain adaptation method","domain knowledge adaptation","limited diagnostic efficiency","learning of deep diagnosis models","task difference issue","important diagnostic method","feature adversarial adaptation","discrepancy of data distributions","CT images","chest radiography images","novel classifier separation scheme","outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","prohibitive annotation costs","urgent work of doctors","X-Ray","lung infection","great potential","domains","critical difficulty","AI-based technologies","effective computer-aided means","similar characteristics","real-world applications","annotations","Extensive experiments","patients","way","infected millions of people","examinations","main challenges","pandemic","globe"],"language":"en"},

When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure\u0027s overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haber, Gregory; Malinovsky, Yaakov; Albert, Paul S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02b3c0c87a6b32d5107a6e05f83f73cb7f939432.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04837v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group testing design","group testing studies","use of group testing","group size","medical screening","issue of testing errors","Large scale disease screening","medical studies","study design","large reduction","medical practitioners","design stage","pooled misclassification parameters","large body of research","given assay","largest screening programs","incorrect assumptions","expected number of tests","total number of tests","sensitivity function","infectious disease","individual samples","impact of pooling","validation study","procedure\u0027s overall sensitivity","initial pooled test","complicated process","poor estimation","approach","accuracy","efficacy","high costs","external population","pools","sample sizes","public health needs","prevalence of infection","skepticism","goal","failure","values","article"],"language":"en"},

The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer.

Such diseases spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected, and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an infected user by turning on the app during active times.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hekmati, Arvin; Ramachandran, Gowri; Krishnamachari, Bhaskar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05251v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["logging of privacy","collection of privacy","privacy guarantees","complete privacy","spread","privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application","GPS locations","mobile devices","mobile applications","users","infected user","person contacts","infected thousands of people","additional infrastructure","form of infrastructure","continuous logging","tracing procedures","intrusive information","party server","known locations","identifiable information","epidemic diseases","empirical trace dataset","based location sensing","CoVID","multiple countries","WiFi APs","Asturies","sensitive data","Ebola","Bluetooth wireless range","simulation study","Health care authorities","short distance","SARS-CoV2","Pandemic","records","active times","vast population","approach","goal","possibility","paper"],"language":"en"},

Daily data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to COVID-19 while satellite climate data for the same period was obtained from the official website of NASA\u0027s Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project. Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease.

The course of this pandemic will be largely shaped by how governments enact timely policies, disseminate the information, and most importantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our study period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bento, Ana I.; Nguyen, Thuy; Wing, Coady; Lozano-Rojas, Felipe; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Simon, Kosali","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24894230a14d3607caea22bffcda1105bcfd09a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04591v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["state","subsequent flows of public information","report of COVID","public discourse","community level policies","coronavirus symptoms","searches","novel coronavirus","informationseeking responses","case public announcement","evolving patterns of responses","elaborate policy responses","elevated level of attention","community circulation","timely policies","hand sanitizer","global pandemic","collective attention","masks","testing","quarantine","outbreak","personal health strategies","grocery delivery","over-the-counter medications","school closures","news","crisis","epidemic","initial announcements","analysis","countries","study period","strong measures","results","governments","confirmed cases","eventstudy framework","people","reports"],"language":"en"},

The UN SDGs are a way of framing opportunities and challenges of a desirable future world and cover topics as broad as ending poverty, gender equality, climate change and smart cities. The relationship between these potentially mutually reinforcing forces is currently under-defined. Building on the vision for 6G, a review of megatrends, on-going activities on the relation of mobile communications to the UN SDGs and existing indicators, a novel linkage between 6G and the UN SDGs is proposed via indicators. The white paper has also launched the work of deriving new 6G related indicators to guide the research of 6G systems. The novel linkage is built on the envisaged three-fold role of 6G as a provider of services to help steer and support communities and countries towards reaching the UN SDGs, as an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help reporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and as a reinforcer of new ecosystems based on 6G technology enablers and 6G network of networks to be developed in line with the UN SDGs that incorporates future mobile communication technologies available in 2030. Related challenges are also identified. An action plan is presented along with prioritized focus areas within the mobile communication sector technology and industry evolution to best support the achievement of the UN SDGs.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matinmikko-Blue, Marja; Aalto, Sirpa; Asghar, Muhammad Imran; Berndt, Hendrik; Chen, Yan; Dixit, Sudhir; Jurva, Risto; Karppinen, Pasi; Kekkonen, Markku; Kinnula, Marianne; Kostakos, Panagiotis; Lindberg, Johanna; Mutafungwa, Edward; Ojutkangas, Kirsi; Rossi, Elina; Yrjola, Seppo; Oorni, Anssi; Ahokangas, Petri; Asghar, Muhammad-Zeeshan; Chen, Fan; Iivari, Netta; Katz, Marcos; Kinnula, Atte; Noll, Josef; Oinas-Kukkonen, Harri; Oppermann, Ian; Peltonen, Ella; Saarela, Hanna; Saarnisaari, Harri; Suorsa, Anna; Wikstrom, Gustav; Ziegler, Volker","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c72f6d8e7596cfadf3802d7572e78274e8105e2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14695v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UN SDGs","UN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SDGs","G systems","G related indicators","G communications systems","G technology enablers","G network of networks","existing indicators","relation of mobile communications","mobile communication sector technology","Related challenges","novel linkage","future mobile communication technologies available","new business models","reinforcer of new ecosystems","best support","support communities","desirable future world","industry evolution","poverty","United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","gender equality","climate change","cover topics","prioritized focus areas","on-going activities","productivity","data collection","review of megatrends","achievement","way of framing opportunities","global growth","enabler of measuring tool","research","smart cities","reinforcing forces","commercial launch","fold role","provider of services","aspects of society","hyperlocal granularity","countries","action plan","relationship","white paper","line","vision"],"language":"en"},

Our main contribution is that we reason through why such a contact-tracing strategy is likely to achieve the stated goal of returning to full normalcy. Using probabilistic models, we show that universal adoption is not necessary to achieve the stated goal, thus there is some room for exceptions; however, the adoption rate needs to be very high, e.g., above $95\\%$ depending on the disease parameters.

The fast and accurate detection of the COVID-19 infection is essential to identify, take better decisions and ensure treatment for the patients which will help save their lives.

Both X-ray and CT scan images are considered to evaluate the proposed technique. We employ our Inception Residual Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning (TL) approach for COVID-19 detection and our NABLA-N network model for segmenting the regions infected by COVID-19. The detection model shows around 84.67% testing accuracy from X-ray images and 98.78% accuracy in CT-images. A novel quantitative analysis strategy is also proposed in this paper to determine the percentage of infected regions in X-ray and CT images.

The stochastic approach to the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model has been used to evaluate the dynamics and the effects of locked-down. It is observed that there exist a suitable period to apply locked-down where more susceptible escape from the infection. The effect of the early (as soon as the infected case detected) and late (with respect to the estimated peak of detected cases for no locked-down) implementation of the locked-down has also been studied and found that the late implementation of locked-down will take the least time to end the epidemic.

In this study, we performed a systematic screening of a chemical library, followed by the antiviral evaluation of primary hits and their analogues. Eventually, a novel small-molecule compound PP7 that abrogated the PB1-PB2 association and impaired viral polymerase activity was identified. PP7 exhibited antiviral activities against influenza virus subtypes A (H1N1)pdm09, A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) in cell cultures and partially protected mice against lethal challenge of mouse-adapted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Surprisingly, a panel of other subtypes of influenza virus, including A(H5N1) and A(H7N7), showed various degrees of resistance to the compound. Biochemical studies revealed a similar pattern of resistance on the impairment of polymerase activity. Molecular docking analyses suggested a PP7-binding site that appeared to be completely conserved among the subtypes of the virus mentioned above. Thus, we propose that alternative/additional binding site (s) may exist for the regulation of PB1-PB2 subunits assembly of influenza A virus.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Shuofeng; Chu, Hin; Ye, Jiahui; Singh, Kailash; Ye, Ziwei; Zhao, Hanjun; Kao, Richard Y.T.; Chow, Billy K.C.; Zhou, Jie; Zheng, Bo-Jian","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adc8af676c37bd54262c0372a823681ad1c45429.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113721.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840201/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303722; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303722","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus subtypes","subtypes of influenza virus","PB2 subunits assembly of influenza","adapted influenza","pdm09 virus","PB1-PB2 association","assembly of PB1","regulation of PB1","PP7-binding site","PB1 C-terminal domain","development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics","PB2 N-terminal domain interaction","H1N1","impairment of polymerase activity","novel small-molecule compound PP7","impaired viral polymerase activity","additional binding site","antiviral activities","similar pattern of resistance","various degrees of resistance","antiviral evaluation of primary hits","lethal challenge of mouse","protected mice","cell cultures","chemical library","systematic screening","valuable target","alternative","Molecular docking analyses","Biochemical studies","H9N2","H7N7","analogues","H7N9","H5N1","panel","study"],"language":"en"},

A critical policy area in China has been the health system, and health inequality has become an issue that has led the government to broaden national health insurance programs. This study investigates whether health system resources and performance have converged over the past 30 years across China\u2019s 31 provinces. To examine geographic variation of health system resources and performance at the provincial level, we measure the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence in indicators of health system resources (structure), health services utilization (process), and outcome. All data are from officially published sources: the China Health Statistics Year Book and the China Statistics Year Book. Sigma convergence is found for resource indicators, whereas it is not observed for either process or outcome indicators, indicating that disparities only narrowed in health system resources. Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators, reflecting that provinces with poorer resources were catching up. Convergence found in this study probably reflects the mixed outcome of government input, and market forces. Thus, left alone, the equitable distribution of health care resources may not occur naturally during a period of economic growth. Governmental and societal efforts are needed to reduce geographic health variation and promote health equity.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Di; Zhang, Donglan; Huang, Jiayan; Schweitzer, Stuart","journal":"Inquiry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d11a76dee8f03c0def1b8b254af658b685252588.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5798700.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0046958016631699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["indicators of health system resources","health equity","health inequality","geographic variation of health system resources","geographic health variation","health services utilization","China Health Statistics Year Book","equitable distribution of health care resources","outcome indicators","national health insurance programs","poorer resources","beta convergence","procedure indicators","resource indicators","degree of sigma convergence","advantages of growth","China Statistics Year Book","period of economic growth","performance","provinces","process","study","mixed outcome of government input","China\u2019s rapid","structure","disparities","provincial level","economy","market forces","societal efforts","critical policy area","areas","years","opportunity","issue","data"],"language":"en"},

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 97\\%($\\pm$ 5\\%), while having a specificity rate of around 90\\%. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), and confusion matrix of each model.

This report outlines the rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are included. PyRoss\u0027s current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables, could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to detailed epidemic modelling.

As a result, the existence of relationship between the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This study evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures) proposed by public health experts for COVID-19 which had altered human behavior and their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation and suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantly interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate. However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the transmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination of the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 days if adhered to in an extreme manner.

One solution involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are obvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. The most balanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs with different compliance was measured using pressure-controlled ventilation with a maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of the technique.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tronstad, C.; Martinsen, T.; Olsen, M.; Rosseland, L.

The standard Kingman coalescent model on genealogies - timed trees that represent the ancestry of the sample - is used in a generative model of molecular sequence variation to infer evolutionary parameters. However, the state space of Kingman\u0027s genealogies grows superexponentially with sample size n, making inference computationally unfeasible already for small n. We introduce a new coalescent model called Tajima heterochronous n-coalescent with a substantially smaller cardinality of the genealogical space. This process allows to analyze samples collected at different times, a situation that in applications is both met (e.g. ancient DNA and RNA from rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses) and statistically desirable (variance reduction and parameter identifiability). We propose an algorithm to calculate the likelihood efficiently and present a Bayesian nonparametric procedure to infer the population size trajectory. We provide a new MCMC sampler to explore the space of Tajima\u0027s genealogies and model parameters. We compare our procedure with state-of-the-art methodologies in simulations and applications.

Epidemic models relying on the incidence rate of new cases for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention. However, many prior works in this area mostly focus on the application of the traditional SIR model and disregard the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV, exceptionally the infectious of undiagnosed cases. Here, we propose a SUIR model based on the classical SIR model object to supervise the effective prediction, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. SUIR model adds a unique $U$ (Undiagnosed) state of the epidemic and divides the population into four states: S (Susceptible), U (Undiagnosed), I (Infectious and Uninfectious), and R (Recovered). This approach enables us to predict the incidence of 2019-nCoV effectively and the clear advantage of the model accuracy more reliable than the traditional SIR model.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jingyuan; Lin, Xin; Liu, Yuxi; Qilegeri,; Lin, Hui; Wu, Manqing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47863f1ca95fbb7e048265b28e07956d694f8171.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12433v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUIR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SUIR model","traditional SIR model","model accuracy","nCoV","classical SIR model object","infectious of undiagnosed cases","epidemic outbreaks","Epidemic models","control of infectious diseases","incidence rate of new cases","respiratory diseases","effective prediction","prevention","clear advantage","transmission characteristics","application","area","states","severe pneumonia","population","increasing attention","prior works","China","novel coronavirus","Uninfectious","approach"],"language":"en"},

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the pandemic.

For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from 3 $\\mu$m to 12 $\\mu$m. The LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared (NIR) by a factor of 100. A maximum emission power per area of 11x10^3 W/m$^2$ at $T=2000$ K for a bias voltage of $V=23$ V is achieved by Joule heating. By generalizing Planck\u0027s theory and considering the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in graphene in RPA, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 $\\mu$m and 150 $\\mu$m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between $12^\\circ$ and $80^\\circ$ by tuning the Fermi energy. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabbir, Muhammad Waqas; Leuenberger, Michael N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc70846bc89471a3a161bab2976bcf900e365e74.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09560v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPG","Joule"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graphene plasmons","nanopatterned graphene","emittance of graphene","mid-IR spectroscopy","mid-IR light source","optical mid-IR communication","selective thermal mid-IR source","mid-IR color displays","state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources","nonlocal response of surface plasmons","NPG sheet","thermal emission spectrum","nonlocal hydrodynamic response","localized surface plasmons","coherence length","LSPs","RPA","circ","maximum emission power","nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem","optical cavity","diffusion length","mode theory","Planck\u0027s theory","large areas","FDTD","calculations","conjecture","viscosity","conducting hyperboloid","area of 11x10","wavelength regime","finite-difference time domain","model","near-infrared","presence","elliptical wormhole","beamsteering","virus detection","typical mobility of CVD","control","emitted photons","way","frequency-dependent","spatial phase variation","NIR","electrostatic problem","proof of concept","analysis","range","plane electric field","opportunity","phased arrays","factor","scalability","Fermi energy","bias voltage","Joule heating"],"language":"en"},

Enclosed spaces, such as public transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens.

It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community.

Here, microarray analysis was employed to describe TH17-like innate immunity-related cytokine including TGF-{\\beta} and IL-6 up-regulation in whole blood of ARDS patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. Importantly, among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on ACE2 maturation. Thus, our results suggest that these drugs could act against SARS-CoV-2 by altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boldrini, Alberto; Terruzzi, Luca; Spagnolli, Giovanni; Astolfi, Andrea; Massignan, Tania; Lolli, Graziano; Barreca, Maria Letizia; Biasini, Emiliano; Faccioli, Pietro; Pieri, Lidia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42b5ab0401796d011f8a5d9016960abc7803bef1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13493v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["folding pathway of ACE2","expression of ACE2","folding intermediates","folding process","receptor ACE2","ACE2 maturation","simulation of folding mechanisms","spike-ACE2 interaction","expression of target proteins","protein expression","antiviral drugs","drugs capable","SARS-CoV","major target","druggable pockets","surface proteins","all-atom simulation","different virtual hits","virtual screening repurposing campaign","entire sequence of events","mefloquine","class of antimalaria agents","computational advancements","unprecedented effort","effective therapeutic regimens","quinoline-derivative belonging","binding","vaccines","new coronavirus disease","host Angiotensin","post-translational level","entry","COVID","various cell types","hydroxychloroquine","existence","technology builds","steep climbing of victims","planet","pandemic","native conformation","effects","Enzyme","data","novel method","results"],"language":"en"},

This cytokine storm can cause multiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated with COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many of the biological processes that have been consistently associated with COVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including the downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the response to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86\u002B/80\u002B antigen presenting cells, activated CD4\u002B T cells and IL6 production. Our in-silico study provides additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of the CD80/CD86 signaling axis may be protective of the excessive proinflammatory state associated with COVID-19 in the lungs.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Julia, Antonio; Bonafonte, Irene; G\u0027omez, Antonio; L\u0027opez-Lasanta, Mar\u0027ia; L\u0027opez-Corbeto, Mireia; Mart\u0027inez-Mateu, Sergio H.; Llad\u0027os, Jordi; Rodr\u0027iguez-Nunez, Iv\u0027an; Myers, Richard M.; Marsal, Sara","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e990c41fed396537707d80a5171eb7ae15c6ef3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10055v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","CD80","severe forms","severe proinflammatory states","T cells","T cell co-stimulation","severe symptoms","co-stimulation inhibitor","co-stimulation inhibition","blood transcriptional data","analysis of previous transcriptional data","CoV-infected patients","excessive proinflammatory state","abatacept","downregulation of IL6 production","axis","CD86","hypothesis","infected lungs","rheumatoid arthritis patients","excessive immune response","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells","blood of SARS","systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines","additional support","previous clinical evidence","recent single cell RNA-seq dataset","progression","CD4","progresses","effective therapeutic strategy","multiple organ damage","main elements","cytokine storm","significant correlation","therapies","C80","silico study","pathological features","high level of antagonism","death","antigen","pressing need","pathology","biological processes"],"language":"en"},

With the implementation of this parameter in the refined model, the resulting model performs much better than the classical BN-S model.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoshi, Humayra; SenGupta, Indranil","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a885aea14b0c889a07dd378c3c2dc9c33ef26dfd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14862v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shephard"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["refined model","classical BN-S model","resulting model","aforementioned deterministic parameter","refinement","empirical data set","Bakken crude oil data","volatility approach","wide range of data sets","duration approach","refined Barndorff-Nielsen","appropriate classification problem","various machine","Shephard","couple of different approaches","optimal hedging strategy","commodity markets","deep learning algorithms","paper","extraction","analysis","implementation"],"language":"en"},

To address if these data can be consistently understood, we develop a model that takes into account all main qualitative features of the infection progression under suppression measures, while remaining simple enough to estimate the key dynamics parameters. We find that social distancing measures had a large effect in the provinces, where moreover higher transmissibility appears to have triggered more effective protection. Hubei is, however, a far outlier with significantly larger transmissibility, but lower protection. Predicted infection attack rate is significantly higher for Hubei, but much lower than necessary for herd immunity. Case Fatality Rate is five times larger in Hubei, but our estimated Infection Fatality Rates are much more uniform/consistent across all provinces. Therefore, interplay of transmissibility, effective protection, and detection efficiency differences may explain apparently drastic count discrepancies.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Djordjevic, Marko; Djordjevic, Magdalena; Salom, Igor; Rodic, Andjela; Zigic, Dusan; Milicevic, Ognjen; Ilic, Bojana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/806c83431204dd0a81845466785d3b031b6d849d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09630v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mainland China"],"keyphrases":["Hubei","infection progression","larger transmissibility","higher transmissibility","effective protection","lower protection","estimated Infection Fatality Rates","Predicted infection attack rate","fatality counts","Case Fatality Rate","interplay of transmissibility","Mainland China provinces","times larger","suppression measures","Drastic difference","social distancing measures","drastic count discrepancies","detection efficiency differences","main qualitative features","large effect","Wuhan","COVID","account","public controversies","far outlier","herd immunity","key dynamics parameters","model","data"],"language":"en"},

Applying the Pontryagin\u0027s Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang-bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans.","publish_time":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolzoni, Luca; Bonacini, Elena; Soresina, Cinzia; Groppi, Maria","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07a60045768dfdb11e251513b1eeca679b93c0f1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04447v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maximum control","costs of control","maximal control","control action","unconstrained control problems","time-optimal control problem","different control policies","control reproduction number","optimal strategy","epidemic duration","unconstrained problems","total infectious burden","epidemic models","entire epidemic","switching time","additional unexpected results","bang-bang controls","maximum rate","minimization of outbreaks duration","isolation","PMP","SIR","livestock diseases","Susceptible-Infected","animal movements","culling","priority","previous findings","vaccination","ongoing epidemics","sanitary restrictions","contrast","numerical simulations","wide range of epidemiological circumstances","Pontryagin\u0027s Minimum Principle","export bans","remainder","resource limitations","reduction of transmission","critical consequence","peak of infection"],"language":"en"},

Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Van-Thuan; Dao, Thi-Loi; Ly, Tran Duc Anh; Belhouchat, Khadidja; Chaht, Kamel Larbi; Gaudart, Jean; Mrenda, Bakridine Mmadi; Drali, Tassadit; Yezli, Saber; Alotaibi, Badriah; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54c8da2f34d0e830818e213cfa74e105e10dac38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6882464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1693247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31749410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","Haemophilus","Moraxella","S. pneumoniae","K. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["PCR","LRTI"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["rhinovirus carriage","Dual carriage of","Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage","respiratory symptoms","influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage","Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting","symptoms of LRTI","LRTI symptoms","acquisition of respiratory pathogens","main respiratory pathogens","number of respiratory viruses","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Saudi Arabia","Chronic respiratory disease","Haemophilus influenzae","acquisition of rhinovirus","possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms","Staphylococcus aureus","Hajj","stay","days","potential interactions","French pilgrims","Influenza viruses","study period","result of complex interactions","risk factors","arrival","independent positive mutual association","successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs","participant","rates","coronaviruses","contrast","dynamics","RTIs","bacteria","PCR","data","model","initial clearance"],"language":"en"},

Methods Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed. Results We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats. Conclusions Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, E.; Petrosillo, N.; Koopmans, M.; Beeching, N.; Di Caro, A.; Gkrania-Klotsas, E.; Kantele, A.; Kohlmann, R.; Lim, P.-L.; Markotic, A.; L\u00F3pez-V\u00E9lez, R.; Poirel, L.; Rossen, J.W.A.; Stienstra, Y.; Storgaard, M.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f1d025c103670471b6e8623fe310f2428e34e09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129920.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2017.10.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X17306419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155018/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X17306419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID","Emerging Infections Task Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusions Emerging infections","Emerging Infections Task Force","major drivers of emergent infections","major outbreaks","Clinical Microbiology","infectious diseases","new trends","laboratory surveillance","ageing population","human population","population growth","everyday clinical practice","paper review trends","health care facilities","emergence of recent outbreaks","health care budgets forces clinicians","diagnostic work","European Society","new opportunities","syndromic surveillance","Methods Factors","differential diagnostic considerations","specialized laboratory services","laboratories","need","continuous pressure","ESCMID","manufacturing","stress","proper diagnostics","EITaF","Abstract Objectives","globalization","activities","emphasis","food market","farmland expansion","decades","density","treatable conditions","international travel","Mathematical modeling","biology of evolution","environmental contamination","vector habitats","EID"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Open label, randomised, controlled feasibility study. SETTING: Single-centre research institute in New Zealand recruiting participants from the community. PARTICIPANTS: 30 adult participants with symptoms of a common cold, presenting within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 35 L/min of 100% humidified air at 41\u00B0C via high flow nasal cannulae, 2 hours per day for up to 5 days (rhinothermy), or vitamin C 250 mg daily for 5 days (control). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of screened candidates who were randomised. Secondary outcomes included: proportion of randomised participants who completed the study; modified Jackson scores from randomisation to 10 days after initiation of randomised regimen; time until feeling \u2018a lot better\u2019 compared with study entry; time until resolution of symptoms or symptom score at 10 days postrandomisation; proportion of organisms identified by PCR analysis of nasal swabs taken at baseline; the patterns of use of the rhinothermy device; estimated adherence of the control group; and rhinothermy device tolerability. RESULTS: In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27% to 50%) of potential participants screened for eligibility were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated, and all randomised participants completed the study (100%, 95% CI 88% to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson score was greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with the maximum difference at day 4 (\u22126.4, 95% CI \u22129.4 to \u22123.3). The substantial clinical benefit threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5-unit change.

This review critically surveys the chronological development of biological classification from Aristotle through our postgenomic era with a central focus on cladistics. In 1957, Julian Huxley coined cladogenesis to denote splitting from subspeciation. In 1960, the English translation of Willi Hennig\u2019s 1950 work, Systematic Phylogenetics, was published, which received strong opposition from pheneticists, such as numerical taxonomists Peter Sneath and Robert Sokal, and evolutionary taxonomist, Ernst Mayr, and sparked acrimonious debates in 1960\u20131980. In 1977\u20131990, Carl Woese pioneered in using small subunit rRNA gene sequences to delimitate the three domains of cellular life and established major prokaryotic phyla. Cladistics has since dominated taxonomy. Despite being compatible with modern microbiological observations, i.e. organisms with unusual phenotypes, restricted expression of characteristics and occasionally being uncultivable, increasing recognition of pervasiveness and abundance of horizontal gene transfer has challenged relevance and validity of cladistics. The mosaic nature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes was also gradually discovered. In the mid-2000s, high-throughput and whole-genome sequencing became routine and complex geneologies of organisms have led to the proposal of a reticulated web of life. While genomics only indirectly leads to understanding of functional adaptations to ecological niches, computational modeling of entire organisms is underway and the gap between genomics and phenetics may soon be bridged. Controversies are not expected to settle as taxonomic classifications shall remain subjective to serve the human scientist, not the classified.","publish_time":"2013-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Chi-Chun; Lau, Susanna K.

Limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with MERS-CoV exhibited pathology consistent with late stages of ARDS, which is reminiscent of disease observed in patients infected with SARS coronavirus. Models of MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve, and small animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogenesis (mouse, hamster, guinea pig, and ferret) are naturally resistant to MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify the mouse genome to encode two human amino acids (288 and 330) in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, making mice susceptible to MERS-CoV replication. Serial MERS-CoV passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse-adapted virus that replicated efficiently within the lungs, and evoked symptoms indicative of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including decreased survival, extreme weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pathological signs indicative of end stage lung disease. Importantly, therapeutic countermeasures comprising MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody treatment or a MERS-CoV spike protein vaccine protected engineered mice against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cockrell, Adam S.; Yount, Boyd L.; Scobey, Trevor; Jensen, Kara; Douglas, Madeline; Beall, Anne; Tang, Xian-Chun; Marasco, Wayne A.; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Nature Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dbb0e59758a06df6acb0fd744589f08e9f50686.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5578707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892925/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.226; https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016226.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV replication","Models of MERS","Serial MERS-CoV passage","MERS-CoV spike protein vaccine","severe respiratory disease","induced ARDS","engineered mice","evoked symptoms indicative of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mice susceptible","severe pneumonia","late stages of ARDS","mouse genome","reminiscent of disease","mouse-adapted virus","pulmonary function","pulmonary hemorrhage","decreased survival","SARS coronavirus","novel virus","pathological signs indicative of end stage lung disease","small animal models","extreme weight loss","hamster","pathology consistent","antibody treatment","multi-organ failure","viral pathogenesis","ferret","receptor","humans","guinea pig","case fatality rate","patients","lungs","human amino acids","dipeptidyl peptidase","Limited clinical studies","therapeutic countermeasures","Cas9","CRISPR"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we established a novel simultaneous detection system using TaqMan real-time PCR designed as a system for detection of microbes from bovine diarrhea using real-time PCR (referred to as Dembo-PCR). Dembo-PCR simultaneously detects a total of 19 diarrhea-causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Specific primer\u2013probe sets were newly designed for 7 pathogens and were synthesized on the basis of previous reports for 12 pathogens. Assays were optimized to react under the same reaction conditions. The PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient (R(2)) of standard curves for each assay were more than 80% and 0.9766, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Dembo-PCR in fecal sample analysis was measured with feces spiked with target pathogens or synthesized DNA that included specific nucleotide target regions. The resulting limits of detection (LOD) for virus-spiked samples, bacteria and DNA fragments were 0.16\u20131.6 TCID(50) (PFU/reaction), 1.3\u201313 CFU/reaction and 10\u2013100 copies/reaction, respectively. All reactions showed high sensitivity in pathogen detection. A total of 8 fecal samples, collected from 6 diarrheic cattle, 1 diarrheic calf and 1 healthy cow, were tested using Dembo-PCR to validate the assay\u2019s clinical performance. The results revealed that bovine coronavirus had infected all diarrheic adult cattle and that bovine torovirus had infected the diarrheic calf.

This virus evades the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non-structural protein (nsp) 1, which inhibits both host gene expression and virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling. Thus, nsp1 is a promising target for drugs, as inhibition of nsp1 would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host antiviral defenses. To gain a better understanding of nsp1 mode of action, we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the SARS-CoV nsp1, targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein. From this work, we identified six classes of mutants that abolished, attenuated or increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression and/or antiviral signaling. Each class of mutants clustered on SARS-CoV nsp1 surface and suggested nsp1 interacts with distinct host factors to exert its inhibitory activities. Identification of the nsp1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting nsp1. Significantly, several point mutants increased the inhibitory activity of nsp1, suggesting that coronaviruses could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues.","publish_time":"2013-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jauregui, Andrew R.; Savalia, Dhruti; Lowry, Virginia K.; Farrell, Cara M.; Wathelet, Marc G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec2ecade86e6e7660bd8fc929ab0c602cdf16568.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3639174.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of nsp1","suggested nsp1","SARS-CoV nsp1 surface","nsp1 residues critical","inhibitory activity of nsp1","increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression","host response","host antiviral defenses","better understanding of nsp1 mode of action","distinct host factors","inhibitory activities","point mutants","classes of mutants","class of mutants","identification","solvent exposed residues","immune response","design of drugs","non-structural protein","amino acid protein","interferon","epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","coronaviruses","greater ability","promising target","associated coronavirus","IFN","pathways","mutations","dependent","work"],"language":"en"},

Blood culture is regarded as the gold standard for aetiological diagnosis of sepsis, but it suffers from low sensitivity and long turnaround time. Thus, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have emerged to shorten the time to identification of causative microbes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical utility in everyday practice in the emergency department of two commercial NAATs in patients suspected with sepsis. METHODS: During a six-week period, blood samples were collected consecutively from all adult patients admitted to the general emergency department for suspicion of a community-onset sepsis and treated with intravenous antibiotics. Along with conventional blood cultures, multiplex PCR (Magicplex\u2122) was performed on whole blood specimens whereas portions from blood culture bottles were used for analysis by microarray-based assay (Prove-it\u2122). The aetiological significance of identified organisms was determined by two infectious disease physicians based on clinical presentation and expected pathogenicity. RESULTS: Among 382 episodes of suspected sepsis, clinically relevant microbes were detected by blood culture in 42 episodes (11%), by multiplex PCR in 37 episodes (9.7%), and by microarray in 32 episodes (8.4%). Although moderate agreement with blood culture (kappa 0.50), the multiplex PCR added diagnostic value by timely detection of 15 clinically relevant findings in blood culture-negative specimens. Results of the microarray corresponded very well to those of blood culture (kappa 0.90), but were available just marginally prior to blood culture results. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NAATs on whole blood specimens in adjunct to current culture-based methods provides a clinical add-on value by allowing for detection of organisms missed by blood culture. However, the aetiological significance of findings detected by NAATs should be interpreted with caution as the high analytical sensitivity may add findings that do not necessarily corroborate with the clinical diagnosis.

While partially compensatory for each other, isoform-specific intracellular distribution, cell-type expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms suggest different channel isoforms confer distinct properties to the cell. Scope of review Briefly, established TPC/TRPML functions and interaction partners (\u2018interactomes\u2019) are discussed. Novel TRPML3 interactors are shown, and a meta-analysis of experimentally obtained channel interactomes conducted. Accordingly, interactomes are compared and contrasted, and subsequently described in detail for TPC1, TPC2, TRPML1, and TRPML3. Major conclusions TPC interactomes are well-defined, encompassing intracellular membrane organisation proteins. TRPML interactomes are varied, encompassing cardiac contractility- and chaperone-mediated autophagy proteins, alongside regulators of intercellular signalling.

For differential diagnosis, a multiplex RT\u2010PCR method was established on the basis of the N genes of TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV, the VP7 gene of PRV\u2010A, and the polyprotein genes of PKV and PSaV. This multiplex RT\u2010PCR could specifically detect TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, PRV\u2010A, PKV and PSaV without cross\u2010reaction to any other major viruses circulating in Chinese pig farms. The limit of detection of this method was as low as 10(0)\u201310(1) ng cDNA of each virus. A total of 398 swine faecal samples collected from nine provinces of China between October 2015 and April 2017 were analysed by this established multiplex RT\u2010PCR. The results demonstrated that PDCoV (144/398), PSaV (114/398), PEDV (78/398) and PRV\u2010A (70/398) were the main pathogens, but TGEV was not found in the pig herds in China. In addition, dual infections, for example, PDCoV \u002B PSaV, PDCoV \u002B PRV\u2010A, PRA\u2010V \u002B PSaV and PEDV \u002B PDCoV, and triple infections, for example, PDCoV \u002B PRV\u2010A \u002B PSaV and PEDV \u002B PDCoV \u002B PKV, were found among the collected samples. The multiplex RT\u2010PCR provided a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of swine enteric viruses circulating in Chinese pig farms and will facilitate the prevention and control of swine diarrhoea in China.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Guangming; Fu, Yuguang; Li, Baoyu; Chen, Jianing; Wang, Jianlin; Yin, Baishuang; Sha, Wanli; Liu, Guangliang","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2c7673b22dde6b6aed36d14aafa42c63e6d8425.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168528.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597013/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKV","PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV","PSaV","PEDV","multiplex RT","porcine sapovirus","porcine kobuvirus","porcine deltacoronavirus","porcine rotavirus","PCR method","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","VP7 gene of PRV","major viruses","differential diagnosis of swine enteric viruses","Chinese pig farms","N genes of TGEV","polyprotein genes of PKV","major enteric RNA viruses","control of swine diarrhoea","example","swine faecal samples","pig herds","provinces of China","collected samples","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","triple infections","dual infections","pigs","valuable tool","prevention","basis","PRA","cross\u2010reaction","addition","total","limit of detection","ng cDNA","main pathogens","results"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of PTX\u20103 as a clinical marker in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and examine the correlation of PTX\u20103 with other biomarkers such as C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). METHODS: We enrolled 117 consecutive patients admitted to Seoul St. Mary\u0027s Hospital with LRTI using the WHO criteria. We recorded data on fever duration and peak temperature before admission, duration of fever after admission, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation upon admission, duration of oxygen supplementation, and duration of hospital stay. Upon admission, white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP level were measured. Multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasal swabs. PTX\u20103, PCT, and various cytokines were measured after the study had been completed. RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in the level of PTX\u20103 according to the type of viral infection. PTX\u20103 levels showed a significant correlation with PCT levels, but not with levels of CRP. The level of PTX\u20103 showed a significant correlation with peak temperature and duration of fever before admission as well as interleukin (IL)\u20106 levels. PCT levels showed a significant correlation with IL\u20106 and granulocyte\u2010colony stimulating factor levels, peak temperature, and duration of fever before admission, and duration of hospital stay. CRP levels showed a significant correlation with duration of fever before admission, total WBC count, and neutrophil count. PCT levels significantly predicted a hospital stay of 7 days or more. PTX\u20103, PCT, and CRP levels showed no correlation with any other clinical features. CONCLUSION: PTX\u20103 reflected disease severity but failed to predict length of hospital stay. Further studies evaluating the use of PTX\u20103 as a biomarker in mild LRTI would be useful.

CoVs encode a proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity. Unique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.","publish_time":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graepel, Kevin W.; Lu, Xiaotao; Case, James Brett; Sexton, Nicole R.; Smith, Everett Clinton; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/019d62ede5df5b87a95be82cb5956e1c5cd7107a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f126b7f9c8ba02a0f872b51cf95d08086e0bd4ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/175562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-ExoN","nsp14-ExoN","ExoN-inactivating mutations","Passage-adapted ExoN","disrupted ExoN activity","CoV replication fidelity","increased replication","CoV high-fidelity replication","CoV fitness","enhanced replication","high-fidelity RNA genome replication","defective replication","CoV fidelity","nsp14 of MHV","nucleoside analogs","Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA synthesis","increased competitive fitness","selection favors restoration of replication fidelity","SARS-CoV","WT-MHV","positive sense RNA viruses","increased susceptibility","P250","activities of nsp14","Proofreading-deficient CoVs","proofreading exoribonuclease","murine hepatitis virus","reduced susceptibility","viable mutant viruses","passaged virus population","enhanced resistance","long-term passage","observed changes","secondary mutations","results","additional candidate proteins","significant defects","nsp12-RdRp","additional determinants","increasing resistance","significant barrier","partial reversion","interplay of multiple replicase proteins","novel amino acid changes","proposed link","mutants","times","nonstructural protein","fold","phenotype","P3","cultured cells","data","hypothesis","genotype","coronavirus","virulence","stability","study"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we analyzed the S glycoprotein gene to characterize 10 winter dysentery (WD) coronavirus strains circulated in Korea during 2002\u20132003 and compared the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences with the other known BCoV. The phylogenetic analysis of the entire S glycoprotein gene revealed that the aa sequences of all Korean WD strains were more homologous to each other and were very closely related to respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) strain OK and enteric bovine coronavirus (EBCV) strain LY-138, but were distinct from the other known BCoVs. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit, all Korean WD strains clustered with the respiratory strain OK, BCQ3994 and the enteric strain LY-138, while the Canadian BCQ calf diarrhea and WD strains, and the American RBCV LSU, French EBCV F15 and avirulent VACC, L9, and Mebus strains clustered on a separate major branch. These data suggest that the WD strains circulated in Korea had a genetic property of both RBCV and EBCV and were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strain.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeong, Jae-Ho; Kim, Gye-Yeop; Yoon, Soon-Seek; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, You-Jung; Sung, Chang-Min; Shin, Sung-Shik; Lee, Bong-Joo; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Nam-Yong; Koh, Hong-Bum; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76ce7bf4512fdf362a4bfb63946d751513a8ca38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114273.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170204002850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170204002850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["American RBCV LSU","EBCV","WD","RBCV"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus strains","Korean WD strains","Mebus strains","enteric bovine coronavirus","enteric strain LY","glycoprotein gene of bovine coronavirus","respiratory bovine coronavirus","respiratory strain OK","ancestral enteric strain","entire S glycoprotein gene","phylogenetic analysis","aa sequences","American RBCV LSU","French EBCV F15","molecular analysis of spike","genetic property","Canadian isolates","genetic characteristics","known BCoVs","Canadian BCQ calf diarrhea","avirulent VACC","winter dysentery","L9","S1 subunit","BCQ3994","deduced amino acid","hypervariable region","countries","separate major branch","nucleotide","Abstract","present study","data"],"language":"en"},

In this special article, we reviewed the magnitude of the problem of pneumonia (its prevalence, morbidity and mortality) in the elderly, its etiology, and the dysregulation of the immune system associated with increasing age. In addition, we presented evidence from the literature, including work we did recently, that low zinc status (commonly reported in the elderly) impairs immune function, decreases resistance to pathogens, and is associated not only with increased incidence and duration of pneumonia, increased use and duration of antimicrobial treatment, but also with increased overall mortality in the elderly. Inadequate stores of zinc might therefore be a risk factor for pneumonia in the elderly. Randomized, double blind, controlled studies are needed to determine the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a potential low cost intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia in this vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnett, Junaidah B.; Hamer, Davidson H.; Meydani, Simin N.","journal":"Nutrition Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1cafe8f360b16dd7cc87069ba92335a824195bc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8615e7d95e80c2f65257b98b328aa9180ab3af9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2854541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20041998/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2854541?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00253.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elderly","duration of pneumonia","problem of pneumonia","increased overall mortality","low zinc status","increased use","morbidity","increased incidence","efficacy of zinc supplementation","Inadequate stores of zinc","new risk factor","immune system","immune function","duration of antimicrobial treatment","potential low cost intervention","magnitude","prevalence","controlled studies","evidence","double blind","work","dysregulation","increasing age","resistance","pathogens","vulnerable population","literature","special article","etiology","addition"],"language":"en"},

While infectious diseases can never be completely prevented, measures can be introduced to restrict the entry of pathogens into a population or limit the implications of the presence of a pathogen. Objective research regarding infection control and biosecurity in horses is limited, yet a variety of practical infection prevention and control measures can be used. Unfortunately, infection control can be challenging, because of the nature of the equine industry (e.g. frequent horse movement) and endemic pathogens, but also because of lack of understanding or motivation to try to improve practices.

It is essential that the OH approach continues to be strengthened given South Asia is a hot spot for emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. The objectives of this article are to describe OH research and training and capacity building activities and the important developments in government support for OH in these countries to identify current achievements and gaps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A landscape analysis of OH research, training, and government support in South Asia was generated by searching peer-reviewed and grey literature for OH research publications and reports, a questionnaire survey of people potentially engaged in OH research in South Asia and the authors\u2019 professional networks. RESULTS: Only a small proportion of zoonotic disease research conducted in South Asia can be described as truly OH, with a significant lack of OH policy-relevant research. A small number of multisectoral OH research and OH capacity building programmes were conducted in the region. The governments of Bangladesh and Bhutan have established operational OH strategies, with variable progress institutionalising OH in other countries. Identified gaps were a lack of useful scientific information and of a collaborative culture for formulating and implementing integrated zoonotic disease control policies and the need for ongoing support for transdisciplinary OH research and policy-relevant capacity building programmes. DISCUSSION: Overall we found a very small number of truly OH research and capacity building programmes in South Asia. Even though significant progress has been made in institutionalising OH in some South Asian countries, further behavioural, attitudinal, and institutional changes are required to strengthen OH research and training and implementation of sustainably effective integrated zoonotic disease control policies.","publish_time":"2016-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKenzie, Joanna S.; Dahal, Rojan; Kakkar, Manish; Debnath, Nitish; Rahman, Mahmudur; Dorjee, Sithar; Naeem, Khalid; Wijayathilaka, Tikiri; Sharma, Barun Kumar; Maidanwal, Nasir; Halimi, Asmatullah; Kim, Eunmi; Chatterjee, Pranab; Devleesschauwer, Brecht","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3169377d59bbef414c6f7e4b2b36ef7f65e2b1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5131453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27906123/; https://doi.org/10.3402/iee.v6.33842","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Asia","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["OH research publications","transdisciplinary OH research","OH approach","landscape analysis of OH research","OH capacity building programmes","small number of multisectoral OH research","operational OH strategies","significant lack of OH policy-relevant research","variable progress institutionalising OH","South Asian countries","small proportion of zoonotic disease research","training","capacity building activities","policy-relevant capacity building programmes","government support","ongoing support","technical support","effective integrated zoonotic disease control policies","endemic zoonotic diseases","significant progress","gaps","collaborative culture","collaborative approaches","lack of useful scientific information","need","reports","important developments","implementation","hot spot","funding","formulating","global human pandemic potential","Health","grey literature","Bhutan","questionnaire survey of people","institutional changes","authors\u2019 professional networks","Considerable advocacy","METHODS","peer","current achievements","INTRODUCTION","MATERIALS","governments of Bangladesh","article","RESULTS","region","objectives","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions exhibited differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons (GCN) of the cerebellum and cortical neurons (CN) from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing CN with genes that were expressed more highly in GCN, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1, and Rsad2/Viperin) that mediated antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in GCN. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which likely contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.","publish_time":"2013-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Hyelim; Proll, Sean C.; Szretter, Kristy J.; Katze, Michael G.; Gale, Michael; Diamond, Michael S.","journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b3d08dea77cc6eb97d674682c1a4eb6145940a1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0b2eb4a443dcba218e3a3160c4caebe09ff94114.json; document_parses/pdf_json/17bb46e849ed4bea9d0c718bc05190b366a37635.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7ea8a6e74e46f70f70c151746ef2df2bada07216.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3618596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23455712/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["susceptibility of neurons","cortical neurons","types of neurons","GCN","distinct brain regions","Granule cell neurons","differential susceptibility","microbial infection","unique innate immune programs","unique innate immune signatures","viral infection ex","differential permissivity","antiviral effects","transducing CN","microRNA-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates","enhanced antiviral response","different neurotropic viruses","interferon-stimulated genes","positive-stranded RNA viruses","replication","cerebral cortex","Irg1","Ifi27","cerebellum","major determinant of clinical outcome","Viperin","Rsad2","epigenetic state","relative permissiveness","molecular factors"],"language":"en"},

A more detailed understanding of the kinetics of infection of MERS-CoV is needed in order to optimise the use of existing assays. Notably, MERS-CoV point-of-care tests are needed in order to optimise supportive care and to minimise transmission risk. However, for new test development, sourcing clinical material continues to be a major challenge to achieving assay validation. Harmonisation and standardisation of laboratory methods are essential for surveillance and for a rapid and effective international response to emerging diseases. Routine external quality assessment, along with well-characterised and up-to-date proficiency panels, would provide insight into MERS-CoV diagnostic performance worldwide. A defined set of Target Product Profiles for diagnostic technologies will be developed by WHO to address these gaps in MERS-CoV outbreak management.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra; Mazzola, Laura T; Chua, Arlene; Oxenford, Christopher J; Van Kerkhove, Maria D","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/319004f23d1af4357edb2a3862f2619be23a21a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6361340.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Target Product Profiles"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV diagnostic performance","MERS-CoV detection","MERS-CoV point","MERS-CoV outbreak management","diagnostic needs","serological diagnostic tests","diagnostic technologies","diagnostic test development","care tests","surveillance","available tests","order","new test development","risk factors","early detection","disease kinetics","kinetics of infection","case management","outbreak investigations","transmission risk","supportive care","nuanced understanding","detailed understanding","associated challenges","insight","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","clinical material","defined set of Target Product Profiles","effective international response","up-to-date proficiency panels","sources","standardisation of laboratory methods","major challenge","emerging diseases","central role","Routine external quality assessment","control of outbreaks","camels","implementation","gaps","assay validation","Harmonisation","humans","animals","use of existing assays","high-priority pathogens","Diagnostics","review"],"language":"en"},

One approach is related to the different isolating rates in latent period and invasion period. Experiments show that the increasing of isolating rates in invasion period, as long as over 0.5, contributes little to the preventing of epidemic; the improvement of isolation rate in latent period is key to control the disease spreading. Another is a specific mechanism of message delivering and forwarding. Information quality and information accumulating process are also considered there. Macroscopically, diseases are easy to control as long as the immune messages reach a certain quality. Individually, the accumulating messages bring people with certain immunity to the disease. Also, the model is performed on the classic complex networks like scale-free network and small-world network, and location-based social networks. Results show that the proposed measures demonstrate superior performance and significantly reduce the negative impact of epidemic disease.","publish_time":"2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xingyuan; Zhao, Tianfang; Qin, Xiaomeng","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/078e23f33e00bff9c339dc3d16f642f66ad1de0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127083.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437116301315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116301315; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.04.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["latent period","invasion period","preventive control of epidemic diseases","accumulating messages","certain quality","Information quality","negative impact of epidemic disease","preventing of epidemic","model","increasing of isolating rates","different isolating rates","information accumulating process","certain immunity","social networks","immune messages","scale-free network","small-world network","classic complex networks","improvement of isolation rate","location","people","superior performance","novel strategies","proposed measures","specific mechanism of message","Results","Experiments","approach"],"language":"en"},

These include H1N1 cases with proven coinfections showing clinical association with bacterial contagions. PURPOSE: The objective was to identify H1N1 and copathogens in the Oaxaca (Mexico) population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2009 to 2012. A total of 88 study patients with confirmed H1N1 by quantitative RT-PCR were recruited. METHODS: Total nucleic acid from clinical samples of study patients was analyzed using a TessArray RPM-Flu microarray assay to identify other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: High prevalence of copathogens (77.3%; 68 patients harbored one to three pathogens), predominantly from Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Pseudomonas, were detected. Three patients (3.4%) had four or five respiratory copathogens, whereas others (19.3%) had no copathogens. Copathogenic occurrence with Staphylococcus aureus was 5.7%, Coxsackie virus 2.3%, Moraxella catarrhalis 1.1%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1.1%, and parainfluenza virus 3 1.1%. The number of patients with copathogens was four times higher to those with H1N1 alone (80.68% and 19.32%, respectively). Four individuals (4.5%; two males, one female, and one infant) who died due to H1N1 were observed to have harbored such copathogens as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. CONCLUSION: In summary, copathogens were found in a significant number (\u003E50%) of cases of influenza in Oaxaca. Timely detection of coinfections producing increased acuity or severity of disease and treatment of affected patients is urgently needed.","publish_time":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ram\u00EDrez-Palacios, Luis Rom\u00E1n; Res\u00E9ndez-P\u00E9rez, Diana; Rodr\u00EDguez-Padilla, Maria Cristina; Saavedra-Alonso, Santiago; Real-Najarro, Olga; Fern\u00E1ndez-Santos, Nadia A; Rodriguez Perez, Mario A","journal":"Res Rep Trop Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c3d3ea935a9625190ebf6f76b035999b03e03f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6047622.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/rrtm.s144075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Oaxaca"],"keyphrases":["respiratory copathogens","H1N1 cases","number of patients","confirmed H1N1","High prevalence of copathogens","clinical samples of study patients","treatment of affected patients","Haemophilus","cases of influenza","Oaxaca","Streptococcus","respiratory pathogens","Neisseria","clinical association","proven coinfections","severity of disease","Staphylococcus aureus","severity of infection","Coxsackie virus","parainfluenza virus","significant number","Total nucleic acid","Timely detection of coinfections","increased acuity","TessArray RPM-Flu microarray assay","Moraxella catarrhalis","quantitative RT-PCR","Klebsiella pneumoniae","bacterial contagions","METHODS","times higher","Copathogenic occurrence","RESULTS","Mexico","objective","Multiple factors","males","female","BACKGROUND","population","Pseudomonas","infant","CONCLUSION","summary","pdm09","cross-sectional survey","individuals","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

Urinary tract infections are common in dogs and are typically caused by various commensal bacteria. Here we present the first case report of a urinary tract infection caused by P. acnes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old female Japanese Shiba Inu was hospitalized for polyuria, polydipsia, and severe hematuria. At admission, blood tests revealed leukocytosis, slight anemia, decreased albumin, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen. Computerized tomography showed gas accumulation on the inner side of the bladder wall. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and bilirubinuria without glycosuria. The urine sediment contained large numbers of erythrocytes and leukocytes. Additionally, rod-shaped bacteria were detected by Diff-Quik staining. Enrofloxacin and metronidazole were administered empirically; however, the renal function declined sharply and the patient died 2 days later. Bacteriological examination revealed that the causative agent was Propionibacterium acnes, which was identified as sequence type 53 via multilocus sequence typing. This isolate showed high susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and enrofloxacin, but was resistant to metronidazole.

Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases.","publish_time":"1991-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Clercq, Erik; Murase, Junichi; Marquez, Victor E.","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fccbe2d1dab29119bf24e065b589725df5ae2c7a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000629529190120T; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000629529190120T","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTP","OMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ce-Cyd","C-Cyd","cytocidal activity of Ce","cytocidal effects of Ce","RNA viruses","antitumor action of Ce","potent antiviral agent","DNA viruses","potent cytocidal activity","broad-spectrum antiviral agent active","OMP decarboxylase inhibitors","CTP synthetase","putative target enzyme","herpes","saturated counterpart","Tacaribe","treatment","Sindbis","toga","rhino","therapeutic potential","cytomegalo","Coxsackie","picorna","polio","cyclopentylcytosine","number of tumor cell lines","azauridine","rhabdo","measles","Junin","arena","parainfluenza","Semliki forest","paramyxo","corona","biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides","orthomyxo","finding","nucleosides","Urd","vesicular stomatitis","neoplastic diseases","pox","UTP","combination","lesser extent","Abstract Cyclopentenylcytosine","dThd","dCyd","contrast","pyrazofurin","nucleoside analogues","vaccinia","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis is an acute and highly contagious disease of economic importance due to the reduction in weight gain observed with infected broilers and the drop in egg quality and production associated with infected laying hens. The presence of deep pectoral myopathy has been associated with IBV variants. This lesion is detected at slaughterhouses and is characterized by paleness and atrophy of the deep pectoral muscle, including necrosis of the region, leading to condemnations of the breast muscle, a valuable meat cut in the market. This work aimed to study the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV by describing tracheal and muscle lesions and comparing the frequency of IBV detection via reverse-transcription (RT) PCR in muscle, tracheal, and cecal tonsil samples from broilers with and without myopathy. A case-control study was conducted in 40 broiler flocks vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain. The case group consisted of 23 flocks that presented myopathic lesions under sanitary inspection and a control group of 17 flocks without myopathic lesions. The tracheal, cecal tonsil, and supracoracoid muscle (with and without lesions) samples from the 40 broiler flocks were screened by RT-PCR to detect IBV. Histopathology of muscle and tracheal tissue was carried out. Upon microscopic examination, the muscle samples from the case group presented extensive necrosis, intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, muscle fiber fragmentation, and fibrotic tissue, confirming myopathy, whereas muscles from the control group showed no alterations. The tracheal samples presented a large number of infiltrated mononuclear inflammatory cells that in some areas formed submucosal nodules. A total of 25 flocks tested IBV positive by RT-PCR: 14 from the case group and 11 from the control group. The IBV was detected by RT-PCR directly in muscle samples. Despite that, the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV was not established. The higher positive IBV RT-PCR percentage noted in the cecal tonsil samples demonstrates how important the choice of organs is for diagnostic purposes.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almeida, D.O.; Tortelly, R.; Nascimento, E.R.; Chagas, M.A.; Khan, M.I.; Pereira, V.L.A.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28d401920c1d9984797c4a5897c7379b255c7da0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194598.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119394027; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2012-02476; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119394027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23155012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["muscle samples","muscle lesions","deep pectoral muscle","IBV positive","tracheal samples","breast muscle","supracoracoid muscle","Histopathology of muscle","control group","IBV variants","case group","cecal tonsil samples","higher positive IBV RT-PCR percentage","muscle fiber fragmentation","frequency of IBV detection","broiler flocks","tracheal tissue","presence of deep pectoral myopathy","case-control study","myopathic lesions","infectious bronchitis virus","infected broilers","relationship","intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltration","extensive necrosis","fibrotic tissue","large number of infiltrated mononuclear inflammatory cells","infected laying hens","production","egg quality","reverse-transcription","coronavirus","sanitary inspection","reduction","choice of organs","areas","drop","valuable meat cut","contagious disease of economic importance","weight gain","paleness","atrophy","muscles","diagnostic purposes","market","condemnations","Massachusetts strain","region","microscopic examination","total","submucosal nodules","slaughterhouses","alterations","work"],"language":"en"},

If citizens are informed about their government\u2019s efforts to combat these diseases, will they reward incumbents who have performed well and punish those who have done poorly at this task? Electoral sanctioning requires that combatting disease be a sufficiently salient concern, which, in turn, is likely to depend upon subjective perceptions of the risks posed by particular illnesses. Epidemics typically prompt stronger risk perceptions than endemic diseases, but where both types circulate jointly, the more familiar endemic disease may determine public reactions. The salience of health threats also varies among individuals; those with a self-interest in prevention or a personal connection to the effects of mosquito-borne illnesses may react more strongly. This study presents the results of a face-to-face survey experiment in Pernambuco, Brazil, informing subjects about their mayor\u2019s use of federal funds to combat mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue (an endemic disease) and Zika and chikungunya (both epidemics). We examine the effect of this information on intended vote for the mayor\u2019s reelection. For the full sample, the treatment has no significant effect. However, we find a large and significant punishment effect among voters who know someone affected by microcephaly or the Zika virus. Drawing on survey and focus group evidence, we argue that most voters fail to act upon our treatment information because mosquito control is a low-salience concern primarily associated with endemic rather than epidemic diseases. Our study constitutes the first experimental evidence as to whether informing citizens about government public health efforts affects voting behavior. Our results suggests that, where similar epidemic and endemic diseases circulate together, informational campaigns aiming to induce electoral accountability should also seek to boost the salience of the information by educating the public about the difference between familiar and newer threats.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boas, Taylor C.; Hidalgo, F.

In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cytokines elicited by primary and secondary infections seem to exert subtle and sustained effects on behavioral, hormonal, and metabolic axes, and their combined effects on appetite and metabolism have been postulated to drive wasting. However, correlations of increased blood levels of a particular cytokine with wasting in AIDS have not been consistent observations, perhaps because cytokines act principally as paracrine and autocrine hormones, as well as indirectly by activating other systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the catabolic effects of cytokines is clearly needed if more efficacious strategies are to be developed for the prevention and treatment of wasting in AIDS. In this review we first examine the interacting factors contributing to the AIDS wasting syndrome. We then analyze the complex and overlapping role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of this condition, and put forward a number of hypotheses to explain some of the most important features of this syndrome.","publish_time":"1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hernan R.; Dulloo, Abdul G.; Bistrian, Bruce R.","journal":"Nutrition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdcebfa2e43466c94a37913253faad49eeb406cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135128.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900798001087; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900798001087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AIDS","catabolic effects of cytokines","role of cytokines","large literature implicating cytokines","combined effects","sustained effects","acquired immunodeficiency syndrome","metabolic axes","hormonal","particular cytokine","development","mechanisms","correlations of increased blood levels","secondary infections","interacting factors","appetite","metabolism","pathophysiology","consistent observations","better understanding","autocrine hormones","variety of pathophysiologic conditions","review","cachexia","Abstract","important features","prevention","treatment","number of hypotheses","efficacious strategies","systems"],"language":"en"},

Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in plasma were measured by ELISA, and intracellular activated caspase-3 fragment in different leukocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Patients with SARS had significantly lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and significantly higher sVCAM-1 and sFasL levels compared to healthy controls. sVCAM-1 levels correlated negatively with total leukocytes and platelet counts, but positively with plasma sFasL levels. Intracellular cleaved caspase-3 expression was also significantly higher in lymphocytes from SARS patients in acute phase than in convalescent stage. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in SARS patients may be caused, in part, by enhanced vascular sequestration associated with increased sVCAM-1 levels.

However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5\u2032-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6\u2032-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5\u2032-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6\u2032-fluorinated-5\u2032-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6\u2032-\u03B2-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC50 = 0.36 \u03BCM). Among the compounds tested, 6\u2032-\u03B2-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.12 \u03BCM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 \u03BCM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 \u03BCM, respectively), which suggested that 3a\u2019s antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6\u2032-\u03B2-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Young Sup; Jarhad, Dnyandev B.; Jang, Min Hwan; Kovacikova, Kristina; Kim, Gyudong; Yoon, Ji-seong; Kim, Hong-Rae; Hyun, Young Eum; Tipnis, Amol S.; Chang, Tong-Shin; van Hemert, Martijn J.; Jeong, Lak Shin","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57104097c3644dae34bb5a10720fcfe662f753ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115507.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523419311080; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31841728/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523419311080","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAH","CHIKV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["\u03BCM","potent inhibitory activity","homoaristeromycin analogues","s antiviral activity","inhibition of SAH hydrolase","fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues","showed potent antiviral activity","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","displayed anti-CHIKV activity","potent inhibition","homologated analogues","b inhibited SAH hydrolase","synthesized compounds","RNA viruses","antiviral effect","ZIKV","noticeable cytotoxicity","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","\u03B2-fluoroadenosine analogue","exhibit substantial cytotoxicity","Zika virus","Chikungunya virus","S-adenosyl","similar IC50 values","both3a","serious re-emerging pathogen","infected millions of people","development of antivirals","silyl enol ether","electrophilic fluorination","EC50","high selectivity index","Selectfluor","promising new template","cellular kinases","homocysteine","alphaviruses","approach","phosphorlyation","base","fact","key steps","years","modification","carbon","phosphorylation"],"language":"en"},

However, high-quality evidence to inform management is scarce. Oral amoxycillin-clavulanate is often the first antibiotic chosen for non-severe respiratory exacerbations, because of the antibiotic-susceptibility patterns detected in the respiratory pathogens commonly associated with bronchiectasis. Azithromycin has a prolonged half-life, and with its unique anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, presents an attractive alternative. Our proposed study will test the hypothesis that oral azithromycin is non-inferior (within a 20% margin) to amoxycillin-clavulanate at achieving resolution of non-severe respiratory exacerbations by day 21 of treatment in children with non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS: This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial involving six Australian and New Zealand centers. In total, 170 eligible children will be stratified by site and bronchiectasis etiology, and randomized (allocation concealed) to receive: 1) azithromycin (5 mg/kg daily) with placebo amoxycillin-clavulanate or 2) amoxycillin-clavulanate (22.5 mg/kg twice daily) with placebo azithromycin for 21 days as treatment for non-severe respiratory exacerbations. Clinical data and a parent-proxy cough-specific quality of life (PC-QOL) score will be obtained at baseline, at the start and resolution of exacerbations, and on day 21. In most children, blood and deep-nasal swabs will also be collected at the same time points. The primary outcome is the proportion of children whose exacerbations have resolved at day 21. The main secondary outcome is the PC-QOL score. Other outcomes are: time to next exacerbation; requirement for hospitalization; duration of exacerbation, and spirometry data. Descriptive viral and bacteriological data from nasal samples and blood inflammatory markers will be reported where available. DISCUSSION: Currently, there are no published randomized controlled trials (RCT) to underpin effective, evidence-based management of acute respiratory exacerbations in children with non-CF bronchiectasis. To help address this information gap, we are conducting two RCTs. The first (bronchiectasis exacerbation study; BEST-1) evaluates the efficacy of azithromycin and amoxycillin-clavulanate compared with placebo, and the second RCT (BEST-2), described here, is designed to determine if azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxycillin-clavulanate in achieving symptom resolution by day 21 of treatment in children with acute respiratory exacerbations.

The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient\u0027s son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19. Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Rui-Lin; Chu, Shu-Guang; Luo, Yu; Huang, Zhen-Hao; Hao, Ying; Fan, Cheng-Hui","journal":"World journal of clinical cases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337201/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i7.1265","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","year-old female patient","atypical symptoms of COVID","case of pneumonia","atypical pneumonia virus infection","epidemiological history","fever","difficulties","suggestive of viral pneumonia","severe diarrhea","physical examination","coronavirus disease","CASE SUMMARY","indirect contact","close contact","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","obvious positive signs","lungs","correct diagnosis","Careful acquisition","clinical characteristics","treatment plan","colleague","Wuhan","infected individual","CONCLUSION","ground-glass nodules","blood pressure","computed tomography scan","patient\u0027s son","Hubei Province","spread","gastrointestinal dysfunction","BACKGROUND","misdiagnosis","years","patients"],"language":"en"},

Methods Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30% and 50%). Results The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5% compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50% of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). Conclusion If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kennedy, Deanna M.; Zambrano, Gustavo Jos\u00E9; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto","journal":"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc5dd21345dee339bd0592070ff7977ae30a7910.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425658/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301827; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301827?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SD strategies","stepping","constant SD strategy","day SD time-window","best long-term SD strategy","duration of SD necessary","days","day window","personal protection measures","peak number of active COVID","control","levels of personal caution","total time","two-year period","people","pandemic","time windows","results","effective way","Methods Constant","number of intensive care units","agglomeration","cases","proper hand hygiene","social distancing","reduction","effects of continuous","associated deaths","transmission dynamics","facemask","approach","Abstract Objectives","mean magnitudes","models","threshold","public","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter\u0027s registration. We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blessing, Jenny; Gomez, Julian; Patino, McCoy; Nguyen, Tran","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c2e557b73c6e35918dbd0c6b2f0e7c258a63aa7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08427v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["online voter registration systems","voter confidence","online ballot tracking systems","voter data","mail","security of electronic systems","process of voting","voting process","voter\u0027s registration","public confidence","preferred voting method","vulnerabilities","privacy posture","United States","elections infrastructure","serious privacy questions","ease of access","COVID","traction","decades","effect of disenfranchising voters","adversary","votes","pandemic","adversaries","reasons","purpose","paper","goals"],"language":"en"},

Recently, cities in mainland China and Italy imposed lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19, which gave us an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between seismic noise above 1 Hz and human activities. Using seismic records from stations in China and Italy, we show that seismic noise above 1 Hz was primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that traffic flow did not decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted distinctly to the lockdown conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Han; Eilon, Zachary; Ji, Chen; Tanimoto, Toshiro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bac8f4241cf1c9a32c27a012cfe6a0251f103348.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00131v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Seismic noise","noise data","Italy","seismic records","different cities","Hz","lockdown restrictions","distinct periods of diminished cultural noise","mainland China","lockdown conditions","different Chinese cities","local response","dB energy","human activities","imposition of travel restrictions","local transportation systems","differences","relationship","stations","epidemic","traffic flow","COVID","country","frequencies","unprecedented opportunity","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"arxiv","abstract":"As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the method leverages information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker\u0027s setting of interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility restrictions to create a\u0022synthetic low mobility U.S.\u0022and predict the counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, Anish; Alomar, Abdullah; Sarker, Arnab; Shah, Devavrat; Shen, Dennis; Yang, Cindy","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0e081a9707c431e08fa3f1dc244e3754f18a033.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00072v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Synthetic Interventions","Synthetic Control"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["different interventions","various interventions","overview of Synthetic Interventions","economy","severe mobility restrictions","synthetic low mobility","particular set of interventions","moderate mobility restrictions","effect of mobility","policy makers","pandemic","potential trade-offs","natural generalization of Synthetic Control","policy maker\u0027s setting","principled method","similar gains","similar intervention","daily death data","countries","population","retail","healthcare system","corresponding health","strain","place","information","key challenge","economic implications","transit locations","safety","impact","war","effects","scenario planning","apex","COVID","pressing question","essence","counterfactual trajectory","memo","guidance","world","wave","circumstance","curve"],"language":"en"},

Early indication and detection of diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare resources. The latest developments in machine learning (more specifically, deep learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for EHR (electronic health records), capable of multitask prediction and disease trajectory mapping. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6 million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking absolute improvement of 8.0-10.8%, in terms of Average Precision Score, compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models (in terms of average precision, when predicting for the onset of 301 conditions). In addition to its superior prediction power, BEHRT provides a personalised view of disease trajectories through its attention mechanism; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to improve the accuracy of its predictions; and its (pre-)training results in disease and patient representations that can help us get a step closer to interpretable predictions.","publish_time":"2019-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yikuan; Rao, Shishir; Solares, Jose Roberto Ayala; Hassaine, Abdelaali; Canoy, Dexter; Zhu, Yajie; Rahimi, Kazem; Salimi-Khorshidi, Gholamreza","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09538v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Average Precision Score","BEHRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BEHRT","deep learning","precision healthcare","better disease management","disease trajectory mapping","terms of Average Precision Score","patients","personalised view of disease trajectories","existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models","machine learning","Early indication","latest developments","interpretable predictions","decades of developments","deep neural sequence transduction model","chance of early intervention","superior prediction power","efficient allocation of healthcare resources","electronic health records","attention mechanism","vast majority of diagnoses","diagnosis","training results","great opportunity","flexible architecture","multiple heterogeneous concepts","individuals","patient representations","carers","medicine","striking absolute improvement","detection of diseases","medication","unmet need","step closer","addition","noticeable signs of illness","measurements","onset","conditions","data","accuracy","study"],"language":"en"},

Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization, adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data, molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening data for SARS-CoV-1.

Here we present a method to transform these molecular vibrations into materialized vibrations of thin water films using acoustic actuators, leading to complex patterns of surface waves, and using the resulting macroscopic images in further processing using deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the patterns of water surface waves for each protein structure is used to build training sets for neural networks, aimed to classify and further process the patterns. Once trained, the neural network model is capable of discerning different proteins solely by analyzing the macroscopic surface wave patterns in the water film. Not only can the method distinguish different types of proteins (e.g. alpha-helix vs hybrids of alpha-helices and beta-sheets), but it is also capable of determining different folding states of the same protein, or the binding events of proteins to ligands.

Scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has been found that RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5\u0027-triphosphate-5\u0027-guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, and could be effective drugs for COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC 09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781 are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parvez, Md.

We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of $\\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aronna, M.

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another \u0060flu\u0027-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eff21faa99219df0711ff1f8c467bda132a4a5f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12782v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Random Symptomatic Testing","Location Based Testing","RST","CT"],"locations":["Bengaluru","India"],"keyphrases":["testing policy","various testing policies","different testing policies","Random Symptomatic Testing","number of positive cases","number of confirmed cases of COVID","actual number of ground truth COVID","infected cases","unknown ground truth","RST","ground truth curve","new LBT","agent-based simulation framework","agents","performance","lockdown","model long-distance interactions","traffic flow mobility data","census data","mobility patterns","sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients","new Location","pool of patients","account various communities","Python","Contact Tracing","India","illness","city of Bengaluru","mixing","public discourse","interventions","symptoms similar","flu","presence","proxy","efficacy","distinguishing feature","direction","noise","daily tests"],"language":"en"},

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

We start from the observation that insurance contracts are inherently linked to financial markets, be it via interest rates, or -- as in hybrid products, equity-linked life insurance and variable annuities -- directly to stocks or indices. By defining portfolio strategies on an insurance portfolio and combining them with financial trading strategies we arrive at the notion of insurance-finance arbitrage (IFA). A fundamental theorem provides two sufficient conditions for presence or absence of IFA, respectively. For the first one it utilizes the conditional law of large numbers and risk-neutral valuation. As a key result we obtain a simple valuation rule, called QP-rule, which is market consistent and excludes IFA. Utilizing the theory of enlargements of filtrations we construct a tractable framework for general valuation results, working under weak assumptions. The generality of the approach allows to incorporate many important aspects, like mortality risk or dependence of mortality and stock markets which is of utmost importance in the recent corona crisis. For practical applications, we provide an affine formulation which leads to explicit valuation formulas for a large class of hybrid products.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Artzner, Philippe; Eisele, Karl-Theodor; Schmidt, Thorsten","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a560e50e2cc9aa611680be150af47abfde31d486.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11022v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["valuation of insurance contracts","insurance portfolio","notion of insurance","risk-neutral valuation","simple valuation rule","explicit valuation formulas","general valuation results","equity-linked life insurance","mortality risk","financial markets","portfolio strategies","absence of IFA","large class of hybrid products","financial trading strategies","dependence of mortality","QP-rule","stock markets","conditional law of large numbers","utmost importance","sufficient conditions","tractable framework","variable annuities","presence","affine formulation","important aspects","filtrations","recent corona crisis","finance arbitrage","fundamental theorem","weak assumptions","market consistent","key result","approach","stocks","theory of enlargements","practical applications","attempt","observation","paper","generality","indices","rates"],"language":"en"},

A number of 135 tracheal swabs were taken from fifteen flocks (nine swabs per flock). Each three swabs collected from each flock were pooled in one tube (finally, we had three tubes for each flock). The samples were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products of positive samples were analyzed by sequencing of a (392 bp) segment of the spike gene and the related results were compared with the other IBV sequences in GenBank database. Samples from twelve farms (80.0%) were found to be positive. The viruses from seven farms (46.6%) were identified as field viruses closely related to variant 2. The viruses from three farms (20.0%) were characterized as Mass type and were related to vaccine strains.

We present the complete set of sequences covering the leader encoding and intergenic regions of the MHV-A59 strain. A computer-assisted analysis of the two now complete sets of these sequences of strain IBV-M42 and MHV-A59 shows that, in contrast to the previous theory, differences amongst stabilities of intermolecular base-pairings between the leader and the intergenic regions are not sufficient to determine the mRNA gradients in both MHV and IBV infected cells. Neither can the accessibility of the interacting regions on the leader and the negative stranded genome, as revealed by secondary structure analysis, explain the mRNA levels. The nested gene organisation itself, on the other hand, could be responsible for observed mRNA levels gradually increasing with gene order. Relatively slow new initiation events at intergenic regions are proposed to block elongation of passing transcripts which, via temporary pausing, can cause premature termination of transcription. This effects longer transcripts more than shorter ones.","publish_time":"1988-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konings, D A; Bredenbeek, P J; Noten, J F; Hogeweg, P; Spaan, W J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC338943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intergenic regions","leader","mRNA gradients","interacting regions","MHV-A59 strain","different subgenomic mRNA levels of coronaviruses","sequences of strain IBV-M42","differential premature termination of transcription","complete set of sequences","slow new initiation events","blockage events","complete sets","gene order","IBV infected cells","secondary structure analysis","effects longer transcripts","nested gene organisation","relative strength of transcriptional initiation","differences","stabilities of intermolecular base-pairings","previous theory","negative stranded genome","shorter ones","contrast","temporary pausing","elongation","hand","accessibility","computer"],"language":"en"},

Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. METHODS: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1\u20134, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1\u20134 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P\u003C0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pilkington, Victoria; Pepperrell, Toby; Hill, Andrew","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ca9d3d5d23c8912a57db0e41f0a6f23a05b3408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical safety of favipiravir","serious AEs","favipiravir vs comparators","existing favipiravir safety evidence","gastrointestinal AEs","widespread use of favipiravir","Specific AEs","potential future use of favipiravir","relevant safety data","phase studies","treatment of COVID","unresolved safety concerns","favourable safety profile","analysis of available safety data","comparison arms","short-term use","pandemic COVID","potential sources of evidence","total","hyperuricaemia","statistical comparison","immediate treatment opportunity","longer-term effects of treatment","proportions of grade","early trials","proportion of discontinuations","relevant grey-literature","umifenovir","caution","oseltamivir","lopinavir","broad-spectrum antivirals","coronavirus disease","teratogenicity","MEDLINE databases","uric acid elevations","ritonavir","promise","adverse events","Comparator drugs","search","Ebola","EMBASE","placebo","participants","QTc prolongation","limitations","CONCLUSIONS","person-years","influenza","BACKGROUND","humans","Study follow-up","days","METHODS","RESULTS","inclusion","PYFU"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual\u0027s immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection.

This epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of January 2020) (\u003E90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic spillover events.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela Josefina; Rabaan, Ali A; Sah, Ranjit; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Pagliano, Pasquale; Esposito, Silvano","journal":"Le infezioni in medicina","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["delta-coronaviruses","gamma-coronaviruses","beta-coronaviruses","Alpha-coronaviruses","China","nCoV","mammals","zoonotic spillover events","current data","multiple cities","vertebrate animal","multiple outbreaks","various animal species","bats","novel CoV","nature","probable initial source","global public health burden","provinces","human","wet market","influenza viruses","Pathogen transmission","cases","day","end","birds","understood phenomenon","epidemic","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A \u0022scoping review\u0022 was carried out via PubMed, to synthesize the results of research currently published on this subject. RESULTS Patients with cardiovascular disease were at greater risk of developing COVID-19, especially in its severe form. These patients were five to ten times more at risk of death. Cardiac manifestations, de novo, were dominated by acute myocardial damage, defined by a significant elevation of cardiac troponins. These occurred in 7 to 17% of hospitalized patients. The presence of a new heart lesion in patients with COVID-19 was consistently associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION Given the enormous cardiovascular challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prognostic impact of heart damage, additional research at a high level of evidence will be necessary.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yahia, Faten; Zakhama, Lilia; Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed","journal":"La Tunisie medicale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of COVID","RESULTS Patients","hospitalized patients","greater risk of developing COVID","acute heart damage","cardiovascular disease","new CV manifestations","prognostic impact of heart damage","new heart lesion","acute myocardial damage","results of research","risk of death","Cardiac manifestations","presence of preexisting CV diseases","enormous cardiovascular challenge","additional research","significant elevation of cardiac troponins","co-morbidities","high level of evidence","infection","novo","pandemic","course","CONCLUSION","times","scoping review","METHODS","PubMed","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","severe form","poor prognosis","subject"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Qualitative content analysis. SETTING Canada. PARTICIPANTS Sixteen family physicians who have experienced a public health crisis. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 family physicians practising in various regions across Canada who had experienced what they defined as a public health crisis. These events included environmental crises, like forest fires and hurricanes, and infectious disease crises, like the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1 outbreaks. Interview transcripts were coded using an inductive qualitative content analysis method, specifically focusing on recommendations from participants on how to improve risk communication to family physicians in the event of a future public health crisis. MAIN FINDINGS Based on their personal experiences, participants had many explicit recommendations on how to improve risk communication strategies in the event of a future public health crisis. These included having a single trusted source of information; having timely and succinct communication; having consideration for learners; ensuring access to information for all physicians; improving public health and family medicine collaboration; having crisis information for patients; and creating communication infrastructure before a crisis occurs. CONCLUSION This research provides thoughtful and varied considerations and advice from practising family physicians on how to improve risk communication from public health agencies and professional organizations to this group in the event of a public health crisis. With improved communications between these bodies and family physicians, practitioners will be better informed and prepared to provide the best possible care to their patient populations during such events.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kain, Nicole A; Jardine, Cynthia G","journal":"Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["future public health crisis","public health agencies","future crisis","crisis information","practising family physicians","risk communication strategies","family medicine collaboration","succinct communication","communication infrastructure","PARTICIPANTS","emergency risk communications","professional organizations","explicit recommendations","SETTING Canada","events","DESIGN Qualitative content analysis","inductive qualitative content analysis method","environmental crises","single trusted source of information","improved communications","infectious disease crises","SARS","varied considerations","severe acute respiratory syndrome","forest fires","hurricanes","advice","personal experiences","patient populations","learners","practitioners","bodies","patients","group","H1N1 outbreaks","best possible care","research","access","various regions","MAIN FINDINGS","CONCLUSION","METHODS Semistructured interviews","OBJECTIVE","Interview transcripts"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital. RESULTS All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation. Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Xin; Huang, Juan; Zhao, Fen; Zhou, Yan; Li, Jie-Qiong; Wang, Xiang-Yun","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Changsha"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","clinical features of children","infection","clearance of SARS","main transmission route of SARS","clinical data","clinical typing","days","major clinical types","clinical manifestations of fever","severe type","mild type","common types","median duration of fever","oral transmission","family aggregation","nasopharyngeal swabs","median time","long-term prognosis","nasopharyngeal swab test","multiple site sampling","good short-term prognosis","CONCLUSIONS Intra-family contact","Multiple nucleic acid tests","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts","cough","pharyngeal discomfort","abdominal pain","CD4","immunoglobulins","close contacts","RT-PCR","diarrhea","false negatives","CD8","follow-up","negative result","stools","disease onset","patients","RNA","retrospective analysis","convulsions","possibility of fecal","Abnormal CT findings","cytokine storm","METHODS","interleukin","weeks","discharge","OBJECTIVE","Changsha hospital","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

We retrospectively analyzed data from a total of 215 patients at Ehime University Hospital using their electronic medical records from April to August 2015. Forty of these patients had received interventions relating to treatment-related adverse events. The proportion of a total number of interventions before and after the sharing system was 42/282(14.9%)and 45/215(20.9%), respectively. The proportion of a total number of interventions at the first course of outpatient chemotherapy also increased from 9/40(22.5%)to 14/40(35%)compared with before the sharing system.

Because hand-foot syndrome caused by S-1 was prolonged, the dosage was completed in 11 courses. He remains alive 4.5 years after surgery without recurrence. Although ToGA examination showed that trastuzumab was effective for HER 2-positive unresectable gastric cancer, few reported cases showed progression to cCR after the treatment followed by a regimen of trastuzumab without CDDP, and they had good prognosis. Furthermore, in this case, the liver metastases showed complete response without CDDP.

Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jincheng; Liu, Jinpeng; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Wei; Chen, Xiaoqun; Sun, Chao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Qidong; Wu, Yaping; Liang, Wenjie; Ruan, Lingxiang","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

{"cord_uid":"6enxm9l5","sha":null,"source_x":"Medline","title":"Review of safety and minimum pricing of nitazoxanide for potential treatment of COVID-19.","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32405422","license":"unk","abstract":"Background Many treatments are being assessed for repurposing to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC50) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cmax : EC50 roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects.Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. Conclusion Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M","journal":"Journal of virus eradication","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov","AE","Conclusion Nitazoxanide"],"locations":["Bangladesh","India"],"keyphrases":["safety of nitazoxanide","RCTs of nitazoxanide","Conclusion Nitazoxanide","day course of treatment","day treatment course","daily cost","review of nitazoxanide clinical research","BD","estimated costs","placebo-controlled trials","hepatorenal","higher dose","COVID","TDS","Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data","randomised controlled trials","minimum costs of production","cardiovascular effects","costs of excipients","cardiovascular concerns","weighted-mean cost of US","active control","Cmax","affordable treatment","EC50","participants","SARS-CoV","Mild GI AEs","treatments","good safety profile","subgroup analyses of active","acute infections","coronavirus disease","postulated drugs","clinical studies","evidence base","teratogenic concerns","promising results","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","available list prices","US commercial pharmacies","high ratio of maximum plasma concentration","formulation","days","EMBASE","prior indication","approved doses","replication","loss","Methods","selection of countries","global access","ongoing pandemic","profit margin","serious adverse events","repurposing","kind","Pakistan","India","Bangladesh","phase","times","MEDLINE databases","person-years","tax","efficacy","AE endpoints","teratogenicity","generic","patients","inclusion","Panjiva database","appropriate metrics","significant differences","dosages"],"language":"en"},

To effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel DNA specimens with associated biological information is needed. We examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a DNA biobank. We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20\u2013100\u03BCl) provided ~0.4\u20133.6 \u03BCg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1\u20135) produced ~0.1\u201312 \u03BCg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10\u201350) resulted in ~0.7\u201325 \u03BCg. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using ~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient DNA for sequencing or SNP genotyping.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alhaddad, Hasan; Maraqa, Tasneem; Alabdulghafour, Suha; Alaskar, Huda; Alaqeely, Randa; Almathen, Faisal; Alhajeri, Bader H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63a206dc7356041e3054110691cbd8146278cee1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6355012.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6355012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of DNA","tail-hair follicle DNA","tail-hair follicles","tail-hair samples","quantity of DNA","sufficient DNA","tail-hair follicle samples","amounts of tail","Good quality DNA","camel DNA biobanking","biobank of camel DNA specimens","buccal swab samples","quantities of buccal swabs","blood samples","\u03BCg","form of visible large size DNA bands","adequate quality","camel traits","Camels","rate of degradation","effects of long term-storage","unique adaptations","associated biological information","sequencing","hot-arid regions","livestock","SNP genotyping","period","gel electrophoresis","best source","success","studies","domesticated animals","transportation","ease of collection","greater deterioration","saliva","NanoDrop spectrophotometer","differences","months","volumes","\u03BCl","sources"],"language":"en"},

Collectively, these effects contribute to enzyme catalysis. Here we describe how crowding may bias the conformational change and dynamics of enzyme populations and in this way affect catalysis. Crowding effects have been studied using artificial crowding agents and in vivo-like environments. These studies revealed a correlation between protein dynamics and function in the crowded environment. We suggest that crowded environments be classified into uniform crowding and structured crowding. Uniform crowding represents random crowding conditions created by synthetic particles with a narrow size distribution. Structured crowding refers to the highly coordinated cellular environment, where proteins and other macromolecules are clustered and organized. In structured crowded environments the perturbation of protein thermal stability may be lower; however, it may still be able to modulate functions effectively and dynamically. Dynamic, allosteric enzymes could be more sensitive to cellular perturbations if their free energy landscape is flatter around the native state; on the other hand, if their free energy landscape is rougher, with high kinetic barriers separating deep minima, they could be more robust. Above all, cells are structured; and this holds both for the cytosol and for the membrane environment. The crowded environment is organized, which limits the search, and the crowders are not necessarily inert. More likely, they too transmit allosteric effects, and as such play important functional roles. Overall, structured cellular crowding may lead to higher enzyme efficiency and specificity.","publish_time":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Buyong; Nussinov, Ruth","journal":"Dynamics in Enzyme Catalysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d6ddacb9a35fcaaef96d98d04227fb89ebb3953.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6361544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structured crowding","uniform crowding","structured cellular crowding","Macromolecular crowding","protein dynamics","random crowding conditions","artificial crowding agents","structured crowded environments","equilibrium of protein","changes protein conformational dynamics","coordinated cellular environment","enzyme catalysis","allosteric effects","membrane environment","dynamics of enzyme populations","perturbation of protein thermal stability","free energy landscape","cellular perturbations","higher enzyme efficiency","conformational change","allosteric enzymes","synthetic particles","substrate interactions","high kinetic barriers","hand","proteins","deep minima","diffusion rate","narrow size distribution","correlation","play important functional roles","native state","specificity","macromolecules","way","studies","crowders","cytosol","functions","search","cells"],"language":"en"},

Using behavioral studies, quantitative RT-PCR and Western-blot techniques, significant findings were determined by the expression of proteins involved in inflammation comparing APP/PS1 and Wild type mice. Increased GFAP expression could be associated with the elevation in number of reactive astrocytes. IL-3 is involved in inflammation and ABDF1 intervenes normally in the transport across cell membranes and both were found up-regulated in APP/PS1 mice compared to Wild type mice. Furthermore, CCR5 expression was decreased and both CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines were highly expressed indicating a possible gliosis and probably an increase in chemotaxis from lymphocytes and T cell generation. We also noted for the first time, a CCR8 increase expression with diminution of its CCL1 chemokine, both normally involved in protection from bacterial infection and demyelination.

HAP poses additional challenges for respiratory sampling, and the utility of sputum or distal sampling in HAP has not been comprehensively evaluated, particularly in HAP admitted to the ICU. METHODS: We analyzed 200 patients with HAP from six ICUs in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The respiratory sampling methods used were divided into non-invasive [sputum and endotracheal aspirate (EAT)] and invasive [fiberoptic-bronchoscopy aspirate (FBAS), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)]. RESULTS: A median of three diagnostic methods were applied [range 2\u20134]. At least one respiratory sampling method was applied in 93% of patients, and two or more were applied in 40%. Microbiological diagnosis was achieved in 99 (50%) patients, 69 (70%) by only one method (42% FBAS, 23% EAT, 15% sputum, 9% BAL, 7% blood culture, and 4% urinary antigen). Seventy-eight (39%) patients underwent a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy when not receiving mechanical ventilation. Higher rates of microbiological diagnosis were observed in the invasive group (56 vs. 39%, p = 0.018). Patients with microbiological diagnosis more frequently presented changes in their empirical antibiotic scheme, mainly de-escalation. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive approach might be undertaken for microbiological diagnosis in critically ill nonventilated HAP. Sputum sampling determined one third of microbiological diagnosis in HAP patients who were not subsequently intubated. Invasive methods were associated with higher rates of microbiological diagnosis.

We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes. The viral infection surveillance method using metagenomics technology enables the monitoring of multiple viral infections, which allows the detection of main infectious viruses.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Yuan; Wang, Suchun; Huang, Baoxu; Zhong, Huanxiang; Pan, Zihao; Zhuang, Qingye; Peng, Cheng; Hou, Guangyu; Wang, Kaicheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97a0381dad9c04b6a53300885acd274d88d4f4d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6382132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","HA"],"locations":["eastern China"],"keyphrases":["avian virus surveillance","avian infectious bronchitis viruses","H3N8 avian influenza viruses","main viruses","major viruses","low pathogenic avian influenza viruses","detected Newcastle disease virus","avian leukemia virus subgroup J","detection of main infectious viruses","duck hepatitis B virus","poultry farms","viral infection surveillance method","HA cleavage sites analysis","F0 cleavage sites analysis","test results","random sampling method","increasing animal pathogen surveillance requirements","metagenomics technology","metagenomic technology","phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes","development of animal diseases","reverse transcription-PCR analyses","monitoring of multiple viral infections","rotavirus G","new technologies","avirulent type","traditional polymerase chain reaction","Class","occurrence","genotypes","roles of pathogens","comprehensive understanding","TC07","provinces","H9N2","throat double swabs","eastern China","LSC","birds"],"language":"en"},

Perinatal infection can cause severe neurological complications, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and in adults there is an association with Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome (GBS). ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp. mosquitoes, yet little is known about its enzootic cycle in which transmission is thought to occur between arboreal Aedes sp. mosquitos and non-human primates. In the 1950s and \u201860s, several bat species were shown to be naturally and experimentally susceptible to ZIKV with acute viremia and seroconversion, and some developed neurological disease with viral antigen detected in the brain. Because of ZIKV emergence in the Americas, we sought to determine susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), one of the most common bats in the New World. Bats were inoculated with ZIKV PRVABC59 but did not show signs of disease. Bats held to 28 days post-inoculation (PI) had detectable antibody by ELISA and viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, saliva and urine in some of the bats. Immunoreactivity using polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody was detected in testes, brain, lung and salivary glands plus scrotal skin. Tropism for mononuclear cells, including macrophages/microglia and fibroblasts, was seen in the aforementioned organs in addition to testicular Leydig cells. The virus likely localized to the brain via infection of Iba1(\u002B) macrophage/microglial cells. Jamaican fruit bats, therefore, may be a useful animal model for the study of ZIKV infection. This work also raises the possibility that bats may have a role in Zika virus ecology in endemic regions, and that ZIKV may pose a wildlife disease threat to bat populations.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malmlov, Ashley; Bantle, Collin; Aboellail, Tawfik; Wagner, Kaitlyn; Campbell, Corey L.; Eckley, Miles; Chotiwan, Nunya; Gullberg, Rebekah C.; Perera, Rushika; Tjalkens, Ronald; Schountz, Tony","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7364053f8be4467970465443c10cc3b39e573137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6382173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV emergence","ZIKV PRVABC59","study of ZIKV infection","brain","common bats","polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody","susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats","emergence of Zika virus","developed neurological disease","Zika virus ecology","mononuclear cells","Perinatal infection","infection of Iba1","signs of disease","microglial cells","New World","wildlife disease threat","testicular Leydig cells","detectable antibody","viral RNA","viral antigen","arboreal Aedes","bat populations","bat species","human infections","severe neurological complications","non-human primates","lung","role","seroconversion","testes","salivary glands","endemic regions","aforementioned organs","macrophages","addition","mosquitos","ELISA","days post-inoculation","neonatal microcephaly","acute viremia","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","Artibeus jamaicensis","association","adults","scrotal skin","useful animal model","qRT-PCR","Immunoreactivity","transmission","GBS","fibroblasts","Tropism","possibility","humans","Americas","urine","enzootic cycle","mosquitoes","work"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to discriminate the components of the working pressure of the respiratory system in infants on MV with severe bronchiolitis admitted to two PICU\u2019s. METHODS: Infants younger than 1 year old with acute respiratory failure caused by severe bronchiolitis underwent neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation and volume controlled MV. Shortly after intubation studies of pulmonary mechanics were performed using inspiratory and expiratory breath hold. The maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow (QI and QE) as well as peak inspiratory (PIP), plateau (PPL) and total expiratory pressures (tPEEP) were measured. Inspiratory and expiratory resistances (RawI and RawE) and Time Constants (K(TI) and K(TE)) were calculated. RESULTS: We included 16 patients, of median age 2.5 (1\u20135.8) months. Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus was the main etiology (93.8%) and 31.3% had comorbidities. Measured respiratory pressures were PIP 29 (26\u201331), PPL 24 (20\u201326), tPEEP 9 [8\u201311] cmH2O. Elastic component of the working pressure was significantly higher than resistive and both higher than threshold (tPEEP \u2013 PEEP) (P \u003C 0.01). QI was significantly lower than QE [5 (4.27\u20136.75) v/s 16.5 (12\u201323.8) L/min. RawI and RawE were 38.8 (32\u201353) and 40.5 (22\u201355) cmH2O/L/s; K(TI) and K(TE) [0.18 (0.12\u20130.30) v/s 0.18 (0.13\u20130.22) s], and K(TI):K(TE) ratio was 1:1.04 (1:0.59\u20131.42). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of respiratory mechanics of infants with severe bronchiolitis receiving MV shows that the elastic component of the working pressure of the respiratory system is the most important. The elastic and resistive components in conjunction with flow profile are characteristic of restrictive diseases. A better understanding of lung mechanics in this group of patients may lead to change the traditional ventilatory approach to severe bronchiolitis.

METHODS: We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children \u003C5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children \u003C5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. RESULTS: In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children \u003C5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R(0) was estimated to be 0.92\u20131.33 for RSV-A and 1.04\u20131.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places.

AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase L-dependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZA-induced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.","publish_time":"2019-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Shuvojit; Gusho, Elona; Gaughan, Christina; Dong, Beihua; Gu, Xiaorong; Holvey-Bates, Elise; Talukdar, Manisha; Li, Yize; Weiss, Susan R.; Sicheri, Frank; Saunthararajah, Yogen; Stark, George R.; Silverman, Robert H.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13531a593bf382e8e4f605622db4f7f2c6ef92a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b1ac4363950bdd885496d03b7b035ca8bb7e2b3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6421468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6421468/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AZA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AZA treatment","toxicity of AZA","rates of AZA","AZA sensitivity of tumor cells","dependent cell death","small-molecule inhibitor of RNase","IFN-dependent","tumor cell survival","response","DNMTi-treated cells","IFN-induced enzymes","IFN production","set of tumor cell lines","Cells deficient","wild-type cells","Self dsRNA accumulation","small-molecule inhibitor of c","IFN-stimulated gene expression","OAS1 expression correlates","level of OAS1","induced apoptosis","DNA methyltransferase inhibitor","related drugs","myelodysplastic syndromes","investigation","profound effects","acute myeloid leukemia","antitumor activity","approved drug","transcription","double-stranded RNA","biomarker","different solid malignant tumors","pharmacologic strategies","role","azacytidine","epigenetic silencing","terminal kinases","JNKs","oligoadenylate synthetase","OASs","activator","transfection","hypomethylated repetitive elements","ionizing radiation","studies","ADAR1","PDE12","AKAP7","pathway","contrast","deficiencies"],"language":"en"},

We studied two relatives who died from influenza. We Sanger sequenced GATA2 and evaluated the mutation by gene transfer, measured serum cytokine levels, and analyzed circulating T- and B-cells. Both patients (father and son, P1 and P2) died in 2011 of H1N1pdm IAV infection at the ages of 54 and 31 years, respectively. They had not suffered from severe or moderately severe infections in the last 17 (P1) and 15 years (P2). A daughter of P1 had died at 20 years from infectious complications. Low B-cell, NK- cell, and monocyte numbers and myelodysplastic syndrome led to sequence GATA2. Patients were heterozygous for a novel, hypomorphic, R396L mutation leading to haplo-insufficiency. B- and T-cell rearrangement in peripheral blood from P1 during the influenza episode showed expansion of one major clone. No T-cell receptor excision circles were detected in P1 and P3 since they were 35 and 18 years, respectively. Both patients presented an exuberant, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3-mediated hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. No data about patients with viremia was available. Two previously reported adult GATA2-deficient patients died from severe H1N1 IAV infection; GATA2 deficiency may predispose to life-threatening influenza in adulthood. However, a role of other genetic variants involved in immune responses cannot be ruled out. Patients with GATA2 deficiency can reach young adulthood without severe infections, including influenza, despite long-lasting complete B-cell and natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, as well as profoundly diminished T-cell thymic output.

Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 \u03BCg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 \u03BCg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), \u03B2-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (\u2206G = \u22125.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (\u2206G = \u22126.1 to \u22129.3 kcal/mol).

Conversely, the hydrophobic surface areas of the intermediates are comparatively less. Further analyses reveal no loss of CsA binding activity in rCyp intermediate.

We used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify cell partners of MOPV and LASV Z matrix protein in which two autophagy adaptors were identified, NDP52 and TAX1BP1. Autophagy has emerged as an important cellular defense mechanism against viral infections but its role during arenavirus infection has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is transiently induced by MOPV, but not LASV, in infected cells two days after infection.

Point-of-care testing in the field is lacking owing to the requirement for a simple, robust field applicable test that does not require professional laboratory equipment. The aim of this study was to establish a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay for the rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). For the assay, a specific RT-PSR primer pair was designed against a conserved region in PEDV ORF3. RESULTS: The RT-PSR was optimized, and PEDV could be detected after a 50 min incubation at 62 \u00B0C, in addition to the 15 min required for reverse transcription. No cross-reaction with other porcine infectious viruses was observed. This new method for PEDV detection was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The positive rates for 65 clinical samples using the new RT-PSR assay and the conventional RT-PCR assay were 58.46% (38/65) and 53.84% (35/65), respectively. In the RT-PSR assay, the addition of a mixture of dyes allowed a positive reaction to be directly observed by the naked eye.

While some PIDs can manifest with more than one phenotype, signs, and symptoms of various PIDs overlap considerably. Recently, novel defects in immune-related genes and additional variants in previously reported genes responsible for PIDs have been successfully identified by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), allowing the recognition of a broad spectrum of disorders. Objective: To evaluate the strength and weakness of targeted NGS sequencing using custom-made Ion Torrent and Haloplex (Agilent) panels for diagnostics and research purposes. Methods: Five different panels including known and candidate genes were used to screen 105 patients with distinct PID features divided in three main PID categories: T cell defects, Humoral defects and Other PIDs. The Ion Torrent sequencing platform was used in 73 patients. Among these, 18 selected patients without a molecular diagnosis and 32 additional patients were analyzed by Haloplex enrichment technology. Results: The complementary use of the two custom-made targeted sequencing approaches allowed the identification of causative variants in 28.6% (n = 30) of patients. Twenty-two out of 73 (34.6%) patients were diagnosed by Ion Torrent. In this group 20 were included in the SCID/CID category. Eight out of 50 (16%) patients were diagnosed by Haloplex workflow. Ion Torrent method was highly successful for those cases with well-defined phenotypes for immunological and clinical presentation. The Haloplex approach was able to diagnose 4 SCID/CID patients and 4 additional patients with complex and extended phenotypes, embracing all three PID categories in which this approach was more efficient. Both technologies showed good gene coverage. Conclusions: NGS technology represents a powerful approach in the complex field of rare disorders but its different application should be weighted. A relatively small NGS target panel can be successfully applied for a robust diagnostic suspicion, while when the spectrum of clinical phenotypes overlaps more than one PID an in-depth NGS analysis is required, including also whole exome/genome sequencing to identify the causative gene.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cifaldi, Cristina; Brigida, Immacolata; Barzaghi, Federica; Zoccolillo, Matteo; Ferradini, Valentina; Petricone, Davide; Cicalese, Maria Pia; Lazarevic, Dejan; Cittaro, Davide; Omrani, Maryam; Attardi, Enrico; Conti, Francesca; Scarselli, Alessia; Chiriaco, Maria; Di Cesare, Silvia; Licciardi, Francesco; Davide, Montin; Ferrua, Francesca; Canessa, Clementina; Pignata, Claudio; Giliani, Silvia; Ferrari, Simona; Fousteri, Georgia; Barera, Graziano; Merli, Pietro; Palma, Paolo; Cesaro, Simone; Gattorno, Marco; Trizzino, Antonio; Moschese, Viviana; Chini, Loredana; Villa, Anna; Azzari, Chiara; Finocchi, Andrea; Locatelli, Franco; Rossi, Paolo; Sangiuolo, Federica; Aiuti, Alessandro; Cancrini, Caterina; Di Matteo, Gigliola","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b74be7b5e6870fb9f10027347b2ad067aa8b4d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6470723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Next Generation Sequencing","NGS","Haloplex","PID","Ion Torrent","SCID/CID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["additional patients","CID patients","selected patients","Ion Torrent sequencing platform","NGS technology","Haloplex approach","custom-made Ion Torrent","weakness of targeted NGS sequencing","genome sequencing","Generation Sequencing","Ion Torrent method","additional variants","custom-made targeted sequencing approaches","Haloplex workflow","main PID categories","spectrum of clinical phenotypes","in-depth NGS analysis","Haloplex enrichment technology","symptoms of various PIDs","Humoral defects","immune-related genes","well-defined phenotypes","novel defects","candidate genes","distinct PID features","different panels","extended phenotypes","powerful approach","SCID","broad spectrum of disorders","small NGS target panel","causative gene","heterogeneous group of genetic immune disorders","complex field of rare disorders","T cell defects","reported genes responsible","identification of causative variants","different application","clinical presentation","CID category","good gene coverage","Agilent","cases","diagnostics","strength","molecular diagnosis","complementary use","signs","recognition","research purposes","Primary Immunodeficiencies","technologies","Methods","Background","Conclusions","robust diagnostic suspicion","Results","exome","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Infants with CFTR mutations show a peribronchial neutrophil infiltration prior to the establishment of infection in their lung. The inflammatory response progressively increases in children that include both upper and lower airways. Infectious and inflammatory response leads to an increase in mucus viscosity and mucus plugging of small and medium-size bronchioles. Eventually, neutrophils chronically infiltrate the airways with biofilm or chronic bacterial infection. Perpetual infection and airway inflammation destroy the lungs, which leads to increased morbidity and eventual mortality in most of the patients with CF. Studies have now established that neutrophil cytotoxins, extracellular DNA, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with increased mucus clogging and lung injury in CF. In addition to opportunistic pathogens, various aspects of the CF airway milieux (e.g., airway pH, salt concentration, and neutrophil phenotypes) influence the NETotic capacity of neutrophils. CF airway milieu may promote the survival of neutrophils and eventual pro-inflammatory aberrant NETosis, rather than the anti-inflammatory apoptotic death in these cells. Degrading NETs helps to manage CF airway disease; since DNAse treatment release cytotoxins from the NETs, further improvements are needed to degrade NETs with maximal positive effects. Neutrophil-T cell interactions may be important in regulating viral infection-mediated pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bacterial infections. Therefore, clarifying the role of neutrophils and NETs in CF lung disease and identifying therapies that preserve the positive effects of neutrophils, while reducing the detrimental effects of NETs and cytotoxic components, are essential in achieving innovative therapeutic advances.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Meraj A.; Ali, Zubair Sabz; Sweezey, Neil; Grasemann, Hartmut; Palaniyar, Nades","journal":"Genes (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a45821b7c9010079cc6021326c1fc2f5cb05e13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6471578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CF airway disease","CF airway milieux","neutrophil cytotoxins","Degrading NETs","CF lung disease","detrimental effects of NETs","positive effects of neutrophils","airway pH","neutrophil phenotypes","airway inflammation","survival of neutrophils","role of neutrophils","neutrophil extracellular traps","viral infection","establishment of infection","increased mucus","Perpetual infection","inflammatory response","peribronchial neutrophil infiltration","chronic bacterial infection","NETotic capacity of neutrophils","Neutrophil-T cell interactions","mucus viscosity","patients","lung injury","maximal positive effects","eventual pro-inflammatory aberrant NETosis","CFTR mutations","extracellular DNA","eventual mortality","bacterial infections","increased morbidity","lower airways","DNAse treatment release cytotoxins","gene cause","transmembrane conductance regulator","various aspects","cystic fibrosis","addition","Infants","pulmonary exacerbations","cytotoxic components","opportunistic pathogens","salt concentration","lungs","biofilm","therapies","anti-inflammatory apoptotic death","Genetic defects","children","innovative therapeutic advances","medium-size bronchioles","cells","Studies","improvements"],"language":"en"},

G6PD deficiency has also been found in other types of cells than RBC, such as leukocytes and myocytes, where an inefficient protection against oxidative stress may occur too. Glutathione (GSH), a significant antioxidant molecule, levels are lower in G6PD individuals, and theoretically, the probability of oxidative stress and haemolysis due to exercise in individuals with G6PD deficiency is increased, whereas dietary supplementation with antioxidants may have beneficial effects on various aspects of this enzymopathy. METHODS: A search of the available literature was conducted using the keywords glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), deficiency, disease, exercise, muscle, antioxidant, vitamin, supplement, and supplementation. The search was limited to publications in English, conducted on humans, and published until August 2018. After screening, only relevant articles were included. RESULTS: There is little evidence indicating that G6PD deficiency can cause perturbations in redox status, haemolysis, and clinical symptoms such as fatigability and myoglobinuria, especially after intense exercise, compared to individuals with normal enzyme levels. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise could be used by G6PD-deficient individuals as a tool to improve their quality of life. However, there is a lack of training studies, and assessment of the effects of regular and systematic exercise in G6PD-deficient individuals is warranted. Finally, since GSH levels are lower in G6PD deficiency, it would be interesting to examine the effects of antioxidant or cysteine donor supplements on redox status after exercise in these individuals.","publish_time":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Georgakouli, Kalliopi; Fatouros, Ioannis G.; Draganidis, Dimitrios; Papanikolaou, Konstantinos; Tsimeas, Panagiotis; Deli, Chariklia K.; Jamurtas, Athanasios Z.","journal":"Oxid Med Cell Longev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4a42dab0e3e471c7a54410c8ddfee13741df4aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6476018.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G6PD deficiency","G6PD individuals","G6PD-deficient individuals","systematic exercise","intense exercise","effects of antioxidant","GSH levels","probability of oxidative stress","redox status","beneficial effects","effects of regular","RBC","haemolysis","phosphate dehydrogenase","search","significant antioxidant molecule","normal enzyme levels","keywords glucose","dietary supplementation","types of cells","red blood cells","cysteine donor supplements","muscle","clinical symptoms","assessment","myoglobinuria","antioxidants","vitamin","tool","perturbations","disease","various aspects","inefficient protection","fatigability","myocytes","available literature","leukocytes","little evidence","lack of training studies","publications","English","enzymopathy","screening","relevant articles","humans","quality of life","RESULTS","METHODS","Glutathione","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

As such, medical centers are becoming more accustomed to managing the deleterious late consequences of combat trauma related to the dysregulation of the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight these late consequences and identify areas for future research and therapeutic strategies. Trauma leads to the dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which places the injured at risk for several late consequences, including delayed wound healing, late onset sepsis and infection, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are significant for their association with the increased morbidity and mortality of wounded personnel. The mechanisms by which these consequences develop are complex but include an imbalance of the immune system leading to robust inflammatory responses, triggered by the presence of damage-associated molecules and other immune-modifying agents following trauma. Treatment strategies to improve outcomes have been difficult to develop as the immunophenotype of injured personnel following trauma is variable, fluid and difficult to determine. As more information regarding the triggers that lead to immune dysfunction following trauma is elucidated, it may be possible to identify the immunophenotype of injured personnel and provide targeted treatments to reduce the late consequences of trauma, which are known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Kelly B.; Krispinsky, Luke T.; Stark, Ryan J.","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfefbec69ff3cf73cd8312d116b1185c773e8608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6480837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["late consequences of trauma","immune system","deleterious late consequences of combat trauma","immune dysfunction","immunophenotype of injured personnel","adaptive immune responses","late onset sepsis","casualty evacuation system","mortality of wounded personnel","therapeutic strategies","Treatment strategies","significant morbidity","dysregulation","robust casualty evacuation capabilities","damage control resuscitation strategies","robust inflammatory responses","multi-organ dysfunction syndrome","presence of damage","combat casualties","increased morbidity","acute respiratory distress syndrome","infection","vehicular body armor","delayed wound healing","areas","future research","targeted treatments","higher levels of care","associated molecules","improvements","association","fluid","outcomes","triggers","imbalance","agents","risk","medical centers","information","mechanisms","review"],"language":"en"},

Limited information on the molecular mechanism of SFTSV infection and pathogenesis impedes the development of effective vaccines and drugs for SFTS prevention and treatment. In this study, an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV-infected HEK 293 cells was performed to explore dynamic host cellular protein responses toward SFTSV infection. A total of 433 of 5,606 host proteins involved in different biological processes were differentially regulated by SFTSV infection. The proteomic results highlighted a potential role of endoplasmic reticular stress-triggered unfolded-protein response (UPR) in SFTSV infection. Further functional studies confirmed that all three major branches of the UPR, including the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and the inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathways, were activated by SFTSV. However, only the former two pathways play a crucial role in SFTSV infection. Furthermore, expression of SFTSV glycoprotein (GP) alone was sufficient to stimulate the UPR, whereas suppression of PERK and ATF6 notably decreased GP expression. Interestingly, two other newly discovered phleboviruses, Heartland virus and Guertu virus, also stimulated the UPR, suggesting a common mechanism shared by these genetically related phleboviruses. This study provides a global view to our knowledge on how host cells respond to SFTSV infection and highlights that host cell UPR plays an important role in phlebovirus infection.

There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines or specific antivirals available against SFTSV. To comprehensively understand the molecular interactions occurring between SFTSV and the host cell, we exploit quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the dynamic host cellular responses to SFTSV infection. The results highlight multiple biological processes being regulated by SFTSV infection. Among these, we focused on exploration of the mechanism of how SFTSV infection stimulates the host cell\u2019s unfolded-protein response (UPR) and identified the UPR as a common feature shared by SFTSV-related new emerging phleboviruses. This study, for the first time to our knowledge, provides a global map for host cellular responses to SFTSV infection and highlighted potential host targets for further research.","publish_time":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lei-Ke; Wang, Bo; Xin, Qilin; Shang, Weijuan; Shen, Shu; Xiao, Gengfu; Deng, Fei; Wang, Hualin; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Manli","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/340036a465efeb78d0b0160bf6dddd2322f293ef.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8812b0579ea75d59a8dca6407431a3f716728556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6498065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6498065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTSV","UPR","U.S. Food and Drug"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular mechanism of SFTSV infection","expression of SFTSV glycoprotein","phlebovirus infection","host cell UPR","quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV","host cells","SFTSV-related new emerging phleboviruses","host proteins","dynamic host cellular protein responses","dynamic host cellular responses","host cell\u2019s unfolded-protein response","highlighted potential host targets","SFTS virus","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","binding protein","study","Guertu virus","Heartland virus","proteomic results","related phleboviruses","discovered phleboviruses","common mechanism","IMPORTANCE Severe fever","important role","quantitative proteomic approach","emerging tick-borne bunyavirus","SFTS prevention","crucial role","discovered tick-borne phlebovirus","ATF6","knowledge","pathways","potential role of endoplasmic reticular stress","different biological processes","multiple biological processes","decreased GP expression","suppression of PERK","global map","global view","common feature","molecular interactions","development of effective vaccines","endoplasmic reticulum kinase","Drug Administration-approved vaccines","pathogenesis","drugs","iTRAQ","specific antivirals available","humans","absolute quantification","infected HEK","isobaric tag","X-box","activating transcription factor","Food","XBP1","PKR","infectious disease","research","major branches","Limited information","treatment","IRE1","functional studies","mortality rate","time","total","inositol","exploration","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

In temperate climate countries, including the U.S., influenza activity peaks during the winter months. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons in the U.S. aged 6 months and older, and among those at increased risk for influenza-related complications in other parts of the world (e.g. young children, elderly). Observational studies have reported effectiveness of influenza vaccination to reduce the risks of severe disease requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. A diagnosis of influenza should be considered in critically ill patients admitted with complications such as exacerbation of underlying chronic comorbidities, community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure during influenza season. Molecular tests are recommended for influenza testing of respiratory specimens in hospitalized patients. Antigen detection assays are not recommended in critically ill patients because of lower sensitivity; negative results of these tests should not be used to make clinical decisions, and respiratory specimens should be tested for influenza by molecular assays. Because critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract disease may have cleared influenza virus in the upper respiratory tract, but have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, an endotracheal aspirate (preferentially) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen (if collected for other diagnostic purposes) should be tested by molecular assay for detection of influenza viruses. Observational studies have reported that antiviral treatment of critically ill adult influenza patients with a neuraminidase inhibitor is associated with survival benefit. Since earlier initiation of antiviral treatment is associated with the greatest clinical benefit, standard-dose oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily in adults) for enteric administration is recommended as soon as possible as it is well absorbed in critically ill patients. Based upon observational data that suggest harms, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is currently not recommended for children or adults hospitalized with influenza, including critically ill patients, unless clinically indicated for another reason, such as treatment of asthma or COPD exacerbation, or septic shock. A number of pharmaceutical agents are in development for treatment of severe influenza.","publish_time":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, Eric J.; Doyle, Joshua D.; Uyeki, Timothy M.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d6af95dffbdeffd31671e351698c7d5a3e6369a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6563376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6563376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["influenza season","diagnosis of influenza","treatment of severe influenza","ill adult influenza patients","ill patients","Annual influenza vaccination","influenza testing of respiratory specimens","influenza-related complications","effectiveness of influenza vaccination","detection of influenza viruses","influenza activity peaks","prolonged influenza viral replication","hospitalized patients","lower respiratory tract disease","respiratory failure","upper respiratory tract","Annual seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity result","treatment of asthma","Molecular tests","Observational studies","molecular assays","adjunctive corticosteroid treatment","earlier initiation of antiviral treatment","lower sensitivity","observational data","adults","risks of severe disease","greatest clinical benefit","Antigen detection assays","COPD exacerbation","clinical decisions","survival benefit","winter months","young children","exacerbation of underlying chronic comorbidities","significant morbidity","hospitalization","intensive care unit admission","neuraminidase inhibitor","mortality","community","pneumonia","development","endotracheal aspirate","negative results","world","harms","parts","standard-dose oseltamivir","increased risk","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen","death","number of pharmaceutical agents","United States","septic shock","elderly","persons","temperate climate countries","diagnostic purposes","enteric administration","reason"],"language":"en"},

Recently, we observed a higher incidence of coronary lesions in KD patients with high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer. Therefore, we hypothesized that KD patients diagnosed with concurrent streptococcal infection have poor prognoses, with respect to treatment response and development of coronary artery lesions. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 723 patients with KD who were admitted to 2 major hospitals between June 2010 and September 2017. RESULTS: Among 723 patients with KD, 11 initially showed an elevated ASO titer (\u003E320 IU/mL) or elevated follow-up ASO titer after treatment. Of these patients, 5 showed no response to the first intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, 3 had abnormalities of the coronary arteries. This is a significantly higher proportion of patients with a high ASO titer (n=3, 27.3%) than those with a normal ASO titer (n=53 [7.4%], P=0.047). A severe clinical course was seen in 81.8% of patients in the high ASO group versus 14.5% of patients in the normal ASO group. CONCLUSION: It is not certain whether acute streptococcal infection may cause KD, but this study revealed that KD with high ASO titers showed higher rates of severe clinical course. It may be helpful to analyze concurrent streptococcal infection in patients with a severe clinical course.","publish_time":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, Dong Eun; Kim, Do Hee; Han, Mi Young; Cha, Sung Ho; Yoon, Kyung Lim","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d14a549840cae71db63fd456f95972809327cd56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6584233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6584233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ASO"],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KD patients","higher proportion of patients","elevated ASO titer","normal ASO titer","high ASO group","high ASO titers","elevated follow-up ASO titer","normal ASO group","concurrent streptococcal infection","acute streptococcal infection","higher rates of severe clinical course","treatment response","higher incidence of coronary lesions","coronary arteries","coronary artery complications","development of coronary artery lesions","high anti-streptolysin O","intravenous immunoglobulin treatment","poor prognoses","respect","refractory types","abnormalities","IU","Kawasaki disease","study","viral infections","PURPOSE","retrospective review","METHODS","RESULTS","major hospitals","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In these assays, acacetin had consistently higher IC(50) values than isoginkgetin. Subsequently, the acacetin was incubated with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radicals (4-methoxy-TEMPO) and then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2212ESI\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS) technology.

The aim of this review is to understand and explore the concepts of global health diplomacy (GHD), health security, and human security. For this narrative review, a literature search was done in PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO for the \u201Cglobal health diplomacy,\u201D \u201Chealth security,\u201D and \u201Chuman security,\u201D and full-texts were reviewed. The recent outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and Zika in South America are pertinent examples of the nature of the human security crisis and the imminent and severe threat posed to human life across the globe as a result of these epidemics. The Commission on Human Security defines human security as the protection of the vital core of all human lives from critical and pervasive threats. We highlight the ways in which health has now become an issue of national security/global concern and also how GHD can aid in the development of new bilateral or multilateral agreements to safeguard the health and security of people in our globalized world. The paper provides a prospective about, and overview of, health and human security that essentially emphasizes the growing interlinkages between global health, diplomacy, and foreign policy.","publish_time":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Knight, Andy W; Kevany, Sebastian; Sehovic, Annamarie Bindenagel","journal":"J Educ Health Promot","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6615119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Non Communicable Diseases","GHD","Commission"],"locations":["Ebola","West Africa","South America"],"keyphrases":["health security","security implications of health","human security crisis","security of people","health arena","global health experts","concepts of global health diplomacy","human lives","human life","issue of national security","global concern","domain of diplomacy","foreign policy","GHD","Communicable Diseases","narrative review","emerging infectious diseases","West Africa","Zika","professionals","related issues","South America","rare opportunity","nature","pertinent examples","severe threat","multilateral agreements","international relations","growing interlinkages","vital core","EBSCO","time","protection","literature search","recent outbreaks of Ebola","development of new bilateral","PubMed","globe","pervasive threats","overview","Commission","result","Scopus","globalized world","epidemics","paper","aim","ways","texts"],"language":"en"},

An effective and affordable HBV control model is urgently needed. A national project of Community-based Collaborative Innovation HBV (CCI-HBV) demonstration areas has optimized the existing community healthcare resources and obtained initial results in HBV control. METHODS: Based on the existing community healthcare network, CCI-HBV project combined the community health management and health contract signing service for long-staying residents in hepatitis B screening. Moreover, HBV field research strategy was popularized in CCI-HBV areas. After screening, patients with seropositive results were enrolled in corresponding cohorts and received treatment at an early stage. And the uninfected people received medical supports including health education through new media, behavior intervention and HBV vaccinations. In this process, a cloud-based National Information Platform (NIP) was established to collect and store residents\u2019 epidemiological data. In addition, a special quality control team was set up for CCI project. RESULTS: After two rounds of screening, HBsAg positive rate dropped from 5.05% (with 5,173,003 people screened) to 4.57% (with 3,819,675 people screened), while the rate of new HBV infections was 0.28 per 100 person-years in the fixed cohorts of 2,584,322 people. The quality control team completed PPS sampling simultaneously and established the serum sample database with 2,800,000 serum samples for unified testing. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-HBV project has established a large-scale field research to conduct whole-population screening and intervention. We analyzed the HBsAg prevalence and new infection rate of HBV in the fixed population for the epidemic trend and intervention effect. The purpose of CCI-HBV project is to establish and evaluate a practical model of grid management and field strategy, to realize the new goal to control hepatitis B in China. To provide policymakers with a feasible model, our results are directly applicable.

Moreover, polymorphisms in IFITM3 have been associated with the severity of the disease in humans. IFITM3 appears to act early in the infection, but its mechanism of action and potential interactions with incoming IAV structures are not yet defined. Here, we visualized endogenous IFITM3 interactions with IAV in the human lung epithelial cell line A549 and in primary human airway epithelial cells employing stimulated emission depletion super-resolution microscopy. By applying an iterative approach for the cluster definition and computational cluster analysis, we found that IFITM3 reorganizes into clusters as IAV infection progresses. IFITM3 cluster formation started at 2-3 h post infection and increased over time to finally coat IAV-containing endosomal vesicles. This IAV-induced phenotype was due to the endosomal recruitment of IFITM3 rather than to an overall increase in the IFITM3 abundance. While the IAV-induced IFITM3 clustering and localization to endosomal vesicles was comparable in primary human airway epithelial cells and the human lung epithelial cell line A549, the endogenous IFITM3 signal was higher in primary cells. Moreover, we observed IFITM3 signals adjacent to IAV-containing recycling endosomes.","publish_time":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kummer, Susann; Avinoam, Ori; Kr\u00E4usslich, Hans-Georg","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9153d6b8fb3af63f68f15f52198cdbc308c97333.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631848.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV infection","IAV-induced IFITM3 clustering","IFITM3 abundance","endogenous IFITM3 interactions","endosomal recruitment of IFITM3","IFITM3 cluster formation","endogenous IFITM3 signal","IFITM3 signals adjacent","IAV-induced phenotype","primary human airway epithelial cells","incoming IAV structures","primary cells","human lung epithelial cell line A549","endosomal vesicles","cluster definition","computational cluster analysis","h post infection","potential interactions","stimulated emission depletion super-resolution microscopy","localization","infectivity","mechanism of action","virus","time","overall increase","iterative approach","tissue culture","recycling endosomes","Interferon","transmembrane proteins","IFITMs","influenza","severity","clusters","disease","humans","polymorphisms"],"language":"en"},

Among them, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly. Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein\u2013Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success. We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells. These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers. We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo. We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target. EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity. Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail. LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth. These studies suggest that engineered EBV latent protein vaccines deserve additional study as potential agents for immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.","publish_time":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wojtak, Krzysztof; Perales-Puchalt, Alfredo; Weiner, David B.","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c04c85e7d1935bf71b5ccca3b9cb3fe3b68131d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV-antigen","EBV tumor antigens","potential immunotherapy of EBV","driven cancers","Acute EBV infection","engineered EBV latent protein vaccines","robust T cell immunity","Barr virus nuclear antigen","Epstein","important antigens","future onset of multiple cancers","LMP2Avax","standalone vaccine","immune profiles","vaccine target","low levels of CD8 T cell immunity","latent viral genes","latent membrane proteins","trivalent vaccine cocktail","DNA vaccines","Burkitt lymphoma","potential agents","Hodgkin lymphoma","nasopharyngeal carcinoma","gastric carcinoma","cases of cancer","infectious mononucleosis","potent immunogens","immune potency","unique profiles","Infectious diseases","positive tumor growth","cancer-related deaths","additional study","SynCon","useful targets","lead","novel Synthetic Consensus","weak immunogen","studies","Previous attempts","infected cells","expression","oncogenic herpesvirus","adult population","LMP1vax","EBNA1vax","genetic sequences","mixed success"],"language":"en"},

More recently, experimental approaches have emerged\u2014and continue to emerge\u2014for discerning the functional role of Ab structure, especially the Fc portion of antibody, in combating viral infections in vivo. A wide range of in vitro measures of antibody activity, from neutralization to antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)\u2014each of these terms representing only an operational notion defined by the particulars of a given assay\u2014are poised for assignment of both relevance and reliability in forecasting outcomes of infection. Of the several emergent technical opportunities for clarity, attention here is drawn to three realms: the increasing array of known modifications that can be engineered into Abs to affect their in vivo activities; the improvement of murine models involving knockouts and knock-ins of host genes including Fc receptors; and the development of additional virological design tools to differentiate Abs that act primarily by inhibiting viral entry from antibodies that mainly target viral antigens (Ags) on cell surfaces. To illustrate some of the opportunities with either zoonotic (emerging, spillover) or ancient human-adapted viruses, we draw examples from a wide range of viruses that affect humans.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmaljohn, Alan L.; Orlandi, Chiara; Lewis, George K.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a676f4ebe85b17d5aedd055c0af967760e13e64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6652135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6652135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abs","viral infections","viral antigens","viral entry","Fc portion of antibody","wide range of viruses","measures of antibody activity","antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity","Fc receptors","cell surfaces","therapeutic approaches","properties of antibodies","experimental approaches","rational vaccine design","emergent technical opportunities","ancient human-adapted viruses","functional role of Ab structure","development of additional virological design tools","neutralization","knock-ins","knockouts","turn","host genes","reliability","spillover","improvement of murine models","attention","ADCC","examples","particulars","assignment","relevance","realms","key complexities","failure","increasing array of known modifications","clarity","headwinds","activities","mammals","Ags","forecasting outcomes of infection","enigmas","operational notion","given assay","terms","specificities","humans","Longstanding discordances"],"language":"en"},

In order to manage and maintain stable productivity, it is important to establish policies for biosecurity. Infectious respiratory diseases are a major threat to poultry farming. Avian influenza and Newcastle disease have been reported in Myanmar, but no scientific information is available for other respiratory pathogens, such as mycoplasmas and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Identifying the genotypes and serotypes of IBVs is especially important to inform vaccination programs. In this study, we detected Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and IBV in several poultry farms in Myanmar. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 20 farms in three major poultry farming areas in Myanmar, and MG, MS, and IBV were detected on two, four, and eight farms, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the observed MG and MS isolates were not identical to vaccine strains. Three different genotypes of IBV were detected, but none was an unknown variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasmas and IBV were detected on poultry farms in Myanmar. Periodic surveillance is required to establish the distribution of each pathogen, and to institute better vaccine protocols.","publish_time":"2019-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujisawa, Sotaro; Murata, Shiro; Takehara, Masaki; Katakura, Ken; Hmoon, Myint Myint; Win, Shwe Yee; Ohashi, Kazuhiko","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79641a9857d5320c10a6619c351f113b1940ce6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6659308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6659308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Myanmar"],"keyphrases":["Myanmar","poultry farms","major poultry farming areas","different genotypes of IBV","major threat","mycoplasmas","major industry","MS isolates","Infectious respiratory diseases","respiratory pathogens","vaccine strains","infectious bronchitis virus","better vaccine protocols","Southeast Asian countries","scientific information","Newcastle disease","serotypes of IBVs","Avian influenza","BACKGROUND","stable productivity","synoviae","polymerase chain reaction","Mycoplasma gallisepticum","vaccination programs","study","distribution","Phylogenetic analysis","order","policies","biosecurity","Samples","CONCLUSIONS","Periodic surveillance","unknown variant","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. RESULTS: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.","publish_time":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Thang; Coletti, Pietro; Melegaro, Alessia; Wallinga, Jacco; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Edmunds, John W.; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel","journal":"Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd614a6233ff72830a79371d92a7680e1b8af33b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f41bb45e2257663c953fd7d3ff1c78f9b37ba268.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6684224.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6684224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social contact surveys","definition of contact","social contact data","nonphysical contact","future contact data surveys","relevant determinants of contact patterns","study design","data collection","Study settings","large number of studies","study details","largest number of studies","Systematic Reviews","aspect of design","statistical analyses","infectious disease","disease prevention","high-income countries","comparison purposes","Meta-Analyses guidelines","specific age group","household size","Web of Science","articles","outcomes","sampling schemes","effective policies","Preferred Reporting Items","aim","models","recommendations","searched PubMed","health care","conference","research institutes","weekday","weekend","control","conversation","Researchers","time schedule","general population","close proximity","overall features","common approach","total","BACKGROUND","schools","METHODS","adults","children","Retrospective","designs","universities","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a quantitative laboratory assessment during 2014\u20132015 in two resource-limited provinces in southern China, Guangxi and Guizhou in order to guide strategies for strengthening core capacities as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). METHODS: We selected 28 public health and clinical laboratories from the provincial, prefecture and county levels through a quasi-random sampling approach. The 11-module World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory assessment tool was adapted to the local context in China. At each laboratory, modules were scored 0\u2013100% through a combination of paper surveys, in-person interviews, and visual inspections. We defined module scores as strong (\u003E = 85%), good (70\u201384%), weak (50\u201369%), and very weak (\u003C 50%). We estimated overall capacity and compared module scores across the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. RESULTS: Overall, laboratories in both provinces received strong or good scores for 10 of the 11 modules. These findings were primarily driven by strong and good scores from the two provincial level laboratories; prefecture and county laboratories were strong or good for only 8 and 6 modules, respectively. County laboratories received weak scores in 4 modules. The module, \u2018Public Health Functions\u2019 (e.g., surveillance and reporting practices) lagged far behind all other modules (mean score = 46%) across all three administrative levels. Findings across the two provinces were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories in Guangxi and Guizhou are generally performing well in laboratory capacity as required by IHR. However, we recommend targeted interventions particularly for county-level laboratories, where we identified a number of gaps. Given the importance of surveillance and reporting, addressing gaps in public health functions is likely to have the greatest positive impact for IHR requirements. The quantitative WHO laboratory assessment tool was useful in identifying both comparative strengths and weaknesses. However, prior to future assessments, the tool may need to be aligned with the new WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework.

However, whether the biomarkers that reflect pathophysiology differ depending on the etiology of ARDS has not been examined. This study aimed to investigate the biomarker profiles of coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury in two subtypes of ARDS: patients with direct common risk factors (dARDS) and those with idiopathic or immune-related diseases (iARDS), which are classified as \u201CARDS without common risk factors\u201D based on the Berlin definition. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital with a diagnosis of ARDS with no indirect risk factors. Plasma biomarkers (thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex [TAT], plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]-1, protein C [PC] activity, procalcitonin [PCT], surfactant protein [SP]-D, and KL-6) were routinely measured during the first 5 days of the patient\u2019s ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 138 eligible patients with ARDS, 51 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria (n = 41) or other causes of ARDS (n = 10). Of the remaining 87 patients, 56 were identified as having dARDS and 31 as having iARDS. Among the iARDS patients, TAT (marker of thrombin generation) and PAI-1 (marker of inhibited fibrinolysis) were increased, and PC activity was above normal. In contrast, PC activity was significantly decreased, and TAT or PAI-1 was present at much higher levels in dARDS compared with iARDS patients. Significant differences were also observed in PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 between patients with dARDS and iARDS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that areas under the ROC curve for PC activity, PAI-1, PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 were similarly high for distinguishing between dARDS and iARDS (PC 0.86, P = 0.33; PAI-1 0.89, P = 0.95; PCT 0.89, P = 0.66; and SP-D 0.88, P = 0.16 vs. KL-6 0.90, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury were observed in both patients with dARDS and with iARDS. However, their biomarker profiles were significantly different between the two groups. The different patterns of PAI-1, PC activity, SP-D, and KL-6 may help in differentiating between these ARDS subtypes.

With limited resources for research available, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies for reorganising PHC delivery, determine where relevant evidence gaps exist and prioritise these for future study. This paper describes an approach for doing this using the best available evidence combined with consultation to establish evidence priorities. We first reviewed PHC organisational interventions in Asia-Pacific LMICs and ascertained evidence gaps. The largest gaps related to interventions to promote access to essential medicines, patient management tools, effective health promotion strategies and service planning and accountability. Evidence from Pacific Island countries was particularly scant. We then engaged an expert panel of 22 PHC stakeholders from seven Asia-Pacific LMICs in a Delphi exercise to identify priority questions for future research. Research priorities were: (1) identifying effective PHC service delivery models for chronic diseases; (2) devising sustainable models of disease integration; (3) optimising task shifting; (4) understanding barriers to care continuity; (5) projecting future PHC needs; and (6) designing appropriate PHC service packages. Notably, stakeholder-determined priorities reflected large, context-dependent system issues, while evidence gaps centred on discrete interventions. Future research on the organisation of PHC services in Asia-Pacific LMICs should incorporate codesign principles to engage researchers and national PHC system stakeholders, and innovative methods that build on existing evidence and account for system complexity.","publish_time":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palagyi, Anna; Dodd, Rebecca; Jan, Stephen; Nambiar, Devaki; Joshi, Rohina; Tian, Maoyi; Abimbola, Seye; Peiris, David","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9791d7ab94765e2012facc4084c479cedbdfaf5e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0ace222a6c33986dfe57d3f24779fe5f674724c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6703300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6703300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHC"],"locations":["Asia-Pacific","Pacific Island"],"keyphrases":["PHC stakeholders","evidence priorities","existing evidence","relevant evidence gaps","ascertained evidence gaps","Asia-Pacific LMICs","reorganising PHC delivery","national PHC system stakeholders","future research","projecting future PHC needs","organisation of PHC services","evidence-based strategies","best available evidence","effective PHC service delivery models","reviewed PHC organisational interventions","appropriate PHC service packages","Research priorities","Asia-Pacific region","Health system planners","research available","Pacific Island countries","system complexity","largest gaps","future study","primary health care","effective health promotion strategies","service planning","universal health coverage","discrete interventions","context-dependent system issues","middle-income countries","sustainable models of disease integration","patient management tools","systems","essential medicines","innovative methods","access","researchers","Delphi exercise","codesign principles","chronic diseases","priority questions","consultation","accountability","continuity","limited resources","expert panel","lack of knowledge","approach","setting","paper","barriers","task"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs. METHODS: We developed and tested a 23-plex PCR coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) assay (sexually transmitted infection-mass spectrometry, STI-MS) that simultaneously targets 11 different agents, including 8 most common clinical pathogens related to STIs (HSV-1, HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Haemophilus ducreyi) and 3 controversial microorganisms as pathogens (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum). RESULTS: The results showed that the STI-MS approach can accurately detect the expected agents, without cross-reaction with other organisms. The limit of detection of each STI-MS assay was ranged from 1.739 to 10.009 copies/reaction, using probit analyses. The verification rate for each target organism of the STI-MS ranged from a minimum of 89.3% to a maximum of 100%, using conventional assays and ultrasensitive digital PCR to confirm the STI-MS-positive results. To further evaluate the clinical performance of this assay, 241 clinical specimens (124 urethral/cervical swabs and 117 urine) were tested in parallel using the STI-MS assay and monoplex real-time PCR for each agent. The overall validation parameters of STI-MS were extremely high including sensitivity (from 85.7% to 100%), specificity (from 92.3% to 100%), PPV (from 50% to 100%), and NPV (from 99.1% to 100%) for each target. CONCLUSION: STI-MS is a useful high-throughput screening tool for detecting mixed infections of STIs and has great potential for application in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of STI.","publish_time":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiu, Leshan; Zhang, Chi; Li, Yamei; Wang, Feng; Peng, Junping","journal":"Infect Drug Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/887264fa70bfd2130e5ef9089f058332364d6313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6717854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6717854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["STI-MS assay","STI-MS approach","specific microorganisms of STI","transmitted pathogens","transmitted infections","overall validation parameters of STI","infections of different","different agents","common clinical pathogens","mixed infections of STIs","clinical specimens","clinical performance","high including sensitivity","transmitted infection-mass spectrometry","high-throughput method","different microbes","expected agents","plex PCR","HSV","positive results","present similar clinical symptoms","monoplex real-time PCR","ultrasensitive digital PCR","various agents responsible","useful high-throughput screening tool","Mycoplasma hominis","Mycoplasma genitalium","controversial microorganisms","Ureaplasma urealyticum","Ureaplasma parvum","target organism","Treponema pallidum","large-scale epidemiological programs","flight","Trichomonas vaginalis","application","great potential","Chlamydia trachomatis","MALDI-TOF","laser desorption ionization-time","Neisseria gonorrhoeae","Haemophilus ducreyi","matrix","cervical swabs","conventional assays","major global health problem","urine","bacteria","viruses","multitarget","copies","probit analyses","current study","verification rate","cross-reaction","limit of detection","PURPOSE","minimum","aim","protozoa","maximum","CONCLUSION","METHODS","specificity","PPV","NPV"],"language":"en"},

As mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the evolutionary trajectories of viruses\u2014and possibly of their epidemiological potential.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aris-Brosou, St\u00E9phane; Parent, Louis; Ibeh, Neke","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/990adafb33c7402d0a1753fb05c351e6bf7fc80d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6722887.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["long-term evolution of viruses","correlated evolution","dsDNA viruses","RNA viruses","single stranded viruses","drivers of viral evolution","evolutionary trajectories of viruses","clear driver of viral evolution","evolutionary processes","viral stability","viral replication","episodic diversifying selection","joint action of selection","diverse mutation rates","evidence","functions","life cycle","virus types","biological replicator","role of intragenomic interactions","key aspects","ssDNA","dsRNA","humans","genome size","ssRNA","proliferation","amino acid level","bacteria","epidemiological potential","genes"],"language":"en"},

With international groups volunteering to join, the \u201CAPASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)\u201D was formed in 2012, which continued to collect prospective ACLF patient data. Based on the prospective data analysis of nearly 1400 patients, the AARC consensus was published in 2014. In the past nearly four-and-a-half years, the AARC database has been enriched to about 5200 cases by major hepatology centers across Asia. The data published during the interim period were carefully analyzed and areas of contention and new developments in the field of ACLF were prioritized in a systematic manner. The AARC database was also approached for answering some of the issues where published data were limited, such as liver failure grading, its impact on the \u2018Golden Therapeutic Window\u2019, extrahepatic organ dysfunction and failure, development of sepsis, distinctive features of acute decompensation from ACLF and pediatric ACLF and the issues were analyzed. These initiatives concluded in a two-day meeting in October 2018 at New Delhi with finalization of the new AARC consensus. Only those statements, which were based on evidence using the Grade System and were unanimously recommended, were accepted. Finalized statements were again circulated to all the experts and subsequently presented at the AARC investigators meeting at the AASLD in November 2018. The suggestions from the experts were used to revise and finalize the consensus. After detailed deliberations and data analysis, the original definition of ACLF was found to withstand the test of time and be able to identify a homogenous group of patients presenting with liver failure. New management options including the algorithms for the management of coagulation disorders, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, variceal bleed, antivirals and criteria for liver transplantation for ACLF patients were proposed. The final consensus statements along with the relevant background information and areas requiring future studies are presented here.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarin, Shiv Kumar; Choudhury, Ashok; Sharma, Manoj K.; Maiwall, Rakhi; Al Mahtab, Mamun; Rahman, Salimur; Saigal, Sanjiv; Saraf, Neeraj; Soin, A.

As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different\u2013omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","publish_time":"2019-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"McClure, Ryan S.; Wendler, Jason P.; Adkins, Joshua N.; Swanstrom, Jesica; Baric, Ralph; Kaiser, Brooke L.

Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein.

Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hacohen, Adar; Cohen, Reuven; Efroni, Sol; Barzel, Baruch; Bachelet, Ido","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a47b92e7fff3658f3bb8fcc6dd5e710836914e1c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4100e3bac23fa7d126b819d0b1d5f81f7d4ffec4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6778202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6778202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based commodity flow","spreading dynamics","homogeneous demand","efficient mitigation","different dynamics","concurrent global demand","thanks","contagion dynamics","decentralized mitigation strategy","dissemination of therapeutics","heterogeneous supply","suppressed local production rates","ideal conditions of extreme production","distinct spreading patterns","challenging conditions","efficient strategies","drug dissemination","global scale","homogeneous nature","similar networks","uneven spread","short DNA sequences","existing distribution networks","recent development of digitizable therapeutics","low therapeutic efficacy","location","shipping capacities","inherent heterogeneity of network","printable chemical compounds","air-transportation","viruses","effect","destinations","competition","drugs","D printing technology","digital sequence files","lives","pathogens","centralized alternative","nodes","decentralization","epidemic","majority","resources"],"language":"en"},

The increased circulation and spread in the Americas of VEEV and other encephalitic arboviruses, such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, underscore the need for research aimed at characterizing the pathogenesis of viral encephalomyelitis for the development of novel medical countermeasures. The host-pathogen dynamics of VEEV Trinidad donkey-infected human astrocytoma U87MG cells were determined by carrying out RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) and mRNAs. To identify the critical alterations that take place in the host transcriptome following VEEV infection, samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection and RNA-Seq data were acquired using an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Differential expression of interferon response, stress response factors, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was observed. The protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR was activated, as the expression of both activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CHOP (DDIT3), critical regulators of the pathway, was altered after infection. Expression of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) was induced in a PERK-dependent manner. EGR1(\u2212/\u2212) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated lower susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death than isogenic wild-type MEFs, indicating that EGR1 modulates proapoptotic pathways following VEEV infection. The influence of EGR1 is of great importance, as neuronal damage can lead to long-term sequelae in individuals who have survived VEEV infection. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses represent a group of clinically relevant viruses transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. In severe cases, viral spread targets neuronal tissue, resulting in significant and life-threatening inflammation dependent on a combination of virus-host interactions. Currently there are no therapeutics for infections cause by encephalitic alphaviruses due to an incomplete understanding of their molecular pathogenesis. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an alphavirus that is prevalent in the Americas and that is capable of infecting horses and humans. Here we utilized next-generation RNA sequencing to identify differential alterations in VEEV-infected astrocytes. Our results indicated that the abundance of transcripts associated with the interferon and the unfolded protein response pathways was altered following infection and demonstrated that early growth response 1 (EGR1) contributed to VEEV-induced cell death.","publish_time":"2016-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baer, Alan; Lundberg, Lindsay; Swales, Danielle; Waybright, Nicole; Pinkham, Chelsea; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Jacobs, Jonathan L.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4aa788ab898b28b00ee103e4d4ab24a2c684caf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4794670.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02827-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26792742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEEV Trinidad","UPR","VEEV"],"locations":["Americas"],"keyphrases":["VEEV infection","Americas of VEEV","VEEV-infected astrocytes","VEEV-induced cell death","following infection","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","virus responsible","combination of virus","eastern equine encephalitis virus","protein kinase RNA","Differential expression of interferon response","unfolded protein response pathways","influence of EGR1","transcription factor early growth response","West Nile virus","stress response factors","RNA-Seq data","generation RNA sequencing","fatal encephalitis","host-pathogen dynamics of VEEV Trinidad donkey-infected human astrocytoma U87MG cells","differential alterations","encephalitic alphaviruses","host transcriptome","critical alterations","host interactions","IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses","humans","UPR","pathogenesis of viral encephalomyelitis","PERK-dependent manner","viral spread targets neuronal tissue","neuronal damage","encephalitic arboviruses","human hosts","proapoptotic pathways","great importance","critical regulators","molecular pathogenesis","endoplasmic reticulum kinase","life-threatening inflammation dependent","isogenic wild-type MEFs","lower susceptibility","components","severe cases","CHOP","incomplete understanding","animal","arm","place","development of novel medical countermeasures","relevant viruses","long-term sequelae","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","DDIT3","group","ATF4","need","h postinfection","individuals","weaponized arthropod","Ion Torrent PGM platform","samples","capable of infecting horses","mosquitoes","abundance of transcripts","therapeutics","infections","poly","research","results","increased circulation","mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

Expression of one of these subgroup-specific genes, ORF7a, resulted in apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. Here, we observed that transient expression of ORF7a protein fused with myc or GFP tags at its N or C terminus inhibited cell growth and prevented BrdU incorporation in different cultural cells, suggesting that ORF7a expression may regulate cell cycle progression. Analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that ORF7a expression was associated with blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells after 24 to 60 h post-transfection. Similar results were observed in COS-7 and Vero cells. Mutation analysis of ORF7a revealed that the domain spanning aa 44\u201382 of 7a protein was essential for its cytoplasmic localization and for induction of the cell cycle arrest. After analyzing the cellular proteins involving in regulation of cell cycle progression, we demonstrated that ORF7a expression was correlated with a significant reduction of cyclin D3 level of mRNA transcription and expression, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at ser795 and ser809/811, not with the expression of cyclin D1, D2, cdk4 and cdk6 in HEK 293 cells. These results suggest that the insufficient expression of cyclin D3 may cause a decreased activity of cyclin D/cdk4/6, resulting in the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Accumulation of hypo- or non-phosphorylated pRb thus prevents cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Xiaoling; Wu, Jie; Shan, Yajun; Yao, Zhenyu; Dong, Bo; Chen, Bo; Zhao, Zhenhu; Wang, Shenqi; Chen, Jiapei; Cong, Yuwen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f696d0f29bee5aa7644047bf40bb54d978fc20e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111786.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205006537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205006537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFP","Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF7a expression","transient expression of ORF7a protein","expression of cyclin D1","blockage of cell cycle progression","regulation of cell cycle progression","cell cycle arrest","insufficient expression of cyclin D3","Mutation analysis of ORF7a","Vero cells","subgroup-specific genes","C terminus inhibited cell growth","G0","G1 phase","cdk4","different cultural cells","structural genes","HEK","decreased activity of cyclin D","inhibition of Rb phosphorylation","significant reduction of cyclin D3 level of mRNA transcription","phosphorylation of retinoblastoma","Similar results","subgroup-specific open reading frames","genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","BrdU incorporation","non-phosphorylated pRb","GFP tags","D2","myc","SARS-CoV","apoptosis","cdk6","induction","cytoplasmic localization","ORFs","ser795","COS","flow cytometry","Accumulation of hypo","cellular proteins","caspase-dependent pathway","ser809","coronaviruses","domain","h post-transfection"],"language":"en"},

Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.

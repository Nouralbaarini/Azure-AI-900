However, epidemiologic reports have suggested that nearly all highly severe or fatal adenoviral diseases in children are associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. Here, we conduct in-depth investigations to confirm and extend these findings through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates. METHODS: A total of 8248 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Children\u2019s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from June 2009 to May 2015. Among 289 samples that tested positive for HAdVs, clinical data of 258 cases of HAdV-3 (127) and HAdV-7 (131) infections were analyzed. All HAdV-positive samples were classified by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes, and compared with clinical data and virological assays. We also performed in vitro assays of virus quantification, viral growth kinetics, competitive fitness, cytotoxicity and C3a assay of the two strains. Mouse adenovirus model was used to evaluate acute inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics revealed that HAdV-7 infection caused more severe pneumonia, toxic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, longer mean hospitalization, significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, compared to those of HAdV-3. In cell culture, HAdV-7 replicated at a higher level than HAdV-3, and viral fitness showed significant differences as well. HAdV-7 also exhibited higher C3a production and cytotoxic effects, and HAdV-7-infected mice showed aggravated pathology and higher pulmonary virus loads, compared to HAdV-3-infected mice. Macrophages in BALF remained markedly high during infection, with concomitant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, and IL-6), compared HAdV-3 infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results document that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. The findings merit further mechanistic studies that offer the pediatricians an informed decision to proceed with early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Yangxi; Tang, Zhengzhen; Ye, Zhixu; Mo, Shi; Tian, Xingui; Ni, Ke; Ren, Luo; Liu, Enmei; Zang, Na","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac6bd522d6d120b2478ef55e4ecebc5f7269f4e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6327436.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6327436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chongqing Medical University","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of HAdV","cases of HAdV","HAdV-positive samples","clinical data","severe complications","severe pneumonia","Clinical characteristics","clinical correlates","acute respiratory infections","viral fitness","higher pulmonary virus loads","hospitalized children","higher C3a production","assays of virus quantification","severe airway inflammation","higher level","infected mice","virological assays","findings","acute inflammatory responses","comprehensive series of assays","respiratory failure","competitive fitness","C3a assay","cell culture","significant differences","results document","viral growth kinetics","pro-inflammatory cytokines","long-term pulmonary sequelae","cause significant morbidity","Human adenovirus type","Mouse adenovirus model","lower white blood cell","mean hospitalization","aggravated pathology","concomitant increase","WBC","TNF-\u03B1","cytotoxicity","Children\u2019s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University","toxic encephalopathy","NPA","early diagnosis","HAdVs","cytotoxic effects","informed decision","nasopharyngeal aspirate","fatal adenoviral diseases","pediatricians","total","platelet counts","replicates","mechanistic studies","IFN-\u03B3","fiber genes","BACKGROUND","exacerbated cytokine response","hexon","BALF","CONCLUSIONS","Macrophages","METHODS","strains","in-depth investigations","epidemiologic reports"],"language":"en"},

Apoptosis is an initiative cell death process that is controlled by genes and is mainly divided into endogenous pathways (mitochondrial pathway), exogenous pathways (death receptor pathway), and apoptotic pathways induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The homeostasis imbalance in ER results in ER stress. Under specific conditions, ER stress can be beneficial to the body; however, if ER protein homeostasis is not restored, the prolonged activation of the unfolded protein response may initiate apoptotic cell death via the up-regulation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). CHOP plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis and this review focuses on its multifunctional roles in that process, as well as its role in apoptosis during microbial infection. We summarize the upstream and downstream pathways of CHOP in ER stress induced apoptosis. We also focus on the newest discoveries in the functions of CHOP-induced apoptosis during microbial infection, including DNA and RNA viruses and some species of bacteria. Understanding how CHOP functions during microbial infection will assist with the development of antimicrobial therapies.","publish_time":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hai; Tian, Mingxing; Ding, Chan; Yu, Shengqing","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/235fab2608254fb0e97f003cef3b4694bc003756.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6328441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6328441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER stress-induced apoptosis","ER stress induced apoptosis","ER protein homeostasis","ER results","functions of CHOP","CHOP functions","downstream pathways of CHOP","apoptotic pathways","apoptotic cell death","microbial infection","form of cell death","exogenous pathways","endogenous pathways","initiative cell death process","death receptor pathway","body","homeostasis imbalance","unfolded protein response","EBP homologous protein","mitochondrial pathway","important role","DNA","RNA viruses","regulation","review","endoplasmic reticulum","prolonged activation","species of bacteria","specific conditions","multifunctional roles","genes","newest discoveries","development of antimicrobial therapies","internal environment"],"language":"en"},

He presented with a 4-day history of increased shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, and non-productive cough. After 4 days of intravenous antibiotics, the patient developed considerable subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum presents most commonly with chest pain, shortness of breath, and subcutaneous emphysema. It has previously been associated with cases of pneumonia but often with rare strains such as P. jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. This case highlights spontaneous pneumomediastinum as a rare complication of pneumonia. Treatment of pneumomediastinum is typically conservative, and although options may be limited, aggressive management of any causative factor may be essential in selected cases. LEARNING POINTS: Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare complications of pneumonia. Computerised tomography is a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying pneumomediastinum in patients with subcutaneous emphysema. While pneumomediastinum is typically a benign condition, aggressive management may occasionally be required. Evidence regarding use of non-invasive/invasive ventilation remains limited but it may theoretically aggravate any air leakage.","publish_time":"2017-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edwards, Michael; Ramappa, Arun Jeenahalli","journal":"Eur J Case Rep Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2e2f923e6fad608a3d34daf4f0ccaa0e4507c44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6346762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6346762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spontaneous pneumomediastinum","Treatment of pneumomediastinum","considerable subcutaneous emphysema","cases of pneumonia","rare complications of pneumonia","rare complication of pneumonia","jirovecii pneumonia","rare strains","aggressive management","pleuritic chest pain","immunocompromised patients","selected cases","day history of increased shortness of breath","fevers","valuable diagnostic tool","causative factor","use of non-invasive","invasive ventilation","Computerised tomography","days of intravenous antibiotics","pre-existing lung disease","benign condition","LEARNING POINTS","non-productive cough","year-old gentleman","Evidence","options","air leakage"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: After patient zero (case #1) was admitted to Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital (May 15-May 17), an outbreak occurred, with 36 cases between May 18 and June 4, 2015. Six patients died (fatality rate, 16.7%). Twenty-six cases occurred in the first-generation, and 10 in the second-generation. The median incubation period was five days, while the median period from symptom onset to death was 12.5 days. While the total attack rate was 3.9%, the attack rate among inpatients was 7.6%, and the inpatients on the eighth floor, where patient zero was hospitalized, had an 18.6% attack rate. In contrast, caregivers and medical staff showed attack rates of 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The attack rates were higher than those of the previous outbreaks in other countries. The outbreak spread beyond Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital when four of the patients were moved to other hospitals without appropriate quarantine. The best method of preventing future outbreaks is to overcome the vulnerabilities observed in this outbreak, such as ward crowding, patient migration without appropriate data sharing, and the lack of an initial broad quarantine.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Kyung Min; Ki, Moran; Cho, Sung-il; Sung, Minki; Hong, Jin Kwan; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Kim, Jong-Hun; Lee, Sang-Eun; Lee, Changhwan; Lee, Keon-Joo; Park, Yong-Shik; Kim, Seung Woo; Choi, Bo Youl","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55b3d85d69f463bf877361addcaba605014f2231.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ed5d3f1db5936c2b86eb9ea46eab96a0b67a124e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4652064.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih/e2015041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26725225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["attack rates","total attack rate","Pyeongtaek","Mary\u2019s Hospital","caregivers of patients","fatality rate","days","median period","control of future outbreaks","previous outbreaks","appropriate quarantine","patient migration","inpatients","median incubation period","test results","medical staff","medical records","confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","appropriate data sharing","initial broad quarantine","MERS","lack","patients\u2019 clinical symptoms","epidemiologic features","prevention","symptom onset","death","lessons relevant","study","METHODS","order","contrast","best method","CONCLUSIONS","hospitals","vulnerabilities","phone calls","OBJECTIVES","countries","floor"],"language":"en"},

Samples microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium were further tested by PCR/sequencing for species assessment. The most frequently detected parasite was Balantidium coli, a facultative pathogenic ciliate with zoonotic potential, in 5.1, 36.7 and 50.0% of suckling, weaners and fatteners and 43.2% of farms; however, no association with disease was observed.

None of the pigs infected with C. scrofarum (n =8), but 3 of 4 piglets infected with C. suis (co-infection with I. suis in 2 cases) had diarrhoea. The zoonotic species C. parvum was not detected, nevertheless, sporadic cases of human infection with the porcine-adapted species have been reported.

However, there are limited data on incorporating handheld based limited echocardiograms into the echocardiogram laboratory. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a limited handheld tablet echocardiogram as an alternate to traditional echocardiography during the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to limit exposure while providing essential clinical information. Methods Ninety consecutive inpatients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection were scanned according to laboratory COVID-19 guidelines using a limited 11-20 clip protocol on a tablet sonograph. The primary assessment was length of study time. Comparison data was drawn from comprehensive echocardiograms ordered on intensive care patients not under COVID-19 precautions. Results Over a 36 day time period there were a total of 91 requests deemed to be appropriate for echocardiography on COVID-19 positive or suspected patients (average age: 67, 64% male, body mass index 32kg/m2). Of these, ninety (99%) were performed on a handheld device and all were deemed diagnostic and provided sufficient information for the clinical care team.

We then look ahead to future applications of these viral entry/fusion inhibitors, either alone or in combination with specific and nonspecific MERS-CoV replication inhibitors, for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Shuai; Liu, Qi; Wang, Qian; Sun, Zhiwu; Su, Shan; Du, Lanying; Ying, Tianlei; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaf27331f63d372547f8055f7484dab80551423c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451066/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","development of MERS","MERS cases","prevention of MERS","MERS-CoV spike protein","CoV entry","nonspecific MERS-CoV replication inhibitors","fusion inhibitors","viral entry","development of effective","S1 subunit","virus binding","S2 subunit","recent studies","receptor-binding domain","recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","coronavirus","role","treatment","RBD","prophylactic strategies","structure","high case fatality rate","global public health","HR1 region","serious threat","combination","future applications","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

SNPs and deletions causing a truncation of the 3c gene product were found in almost all isolates from the diseased tissues of the eight cats suffering from FIP, whereas most, but not all fecal isolates from these same cats had intact 3c genes. Other accessory and structural genes appeared normal in both fecal and lesional viruses. Deliterious mutations in the 3c gene were unique to each cat, indicating that they did not originate in one cat and were subsequently passed horizontally to the others. Compartmentalization of the parental and mutant forms was not absolute; virus of lesional type was sometimes found in feces of affected cats and virus identical to fecal type was occasionally identified in diseased tissues. Although 3c gene mutants in this study were not horizontally transmitted, the parental fecal virus was readily transmitted by contact from a cat that died of FIP to its housemate. There was a high rate of mutability in all structural and accessory genes both within and between cats, leading to minor genetic variants. More than one variant could be identified in both diseased tissues and feces of the same cat. Laboratory cats inoculated with a mixture of two closely related variants from the same FIP cat developed disease from one or the other variant, but not both. Significant genetic drift existed between isolates from geographically distinct regions of the Western US.","publish_time":"2009-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Dodd, Kimberly A.; Pesavento, Patricia A.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/437df56a9488ff2c8be3754b2642fb688115a1b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994544/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v1020166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","Western US"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP cat","fecal isolates","unrelated cats","Laboratory cats","c genes","feces of affected cats","healthy contact cat","fecal type","parental fecal virus","structural genes","c gene product","c gene mutants","accessory genes","diseased tissues","structural gene sequences","virus of lesional type","extraintestinal FIP lesions","virus identical","related variants","minor genetic variants","distinct regions","lesional viruses","disparate regions","Significant genetic drift","half-sib kittens","mutant forms","truncation","FIPV mutation theory","internal FECV","sibs","Coronavirus","mixture","study","high rate of mutability","correlates","Western US","Compartmentalization","Deliterious mutations","SNPs","deletions","housemate"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the mechanisms causing these perturbations have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess acid\u2013base changes in puppies suffering from CPV enteritis, using a modified strong ion model (SIM). The hypothesis of the study was that severe acid\u2013base disturbances would be present and that the SIM would provide insights into pathological mechanisms, which have not been fully appreciated by the Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch model. The study analysed retrospective data, obtained from 42 puppies with confirmed CPV enteritis and 10 healthy control dogs. The CPV-enteritis group had been allocated a clinical score, to allow classification of the data according to clinical severity. The effects of changes in free water, chloride, l-lactate, albumin and phosphate were calculated, using a modification of the base excess algorithm. When the data were summated for each patient, and correlated to each individual component, the most important contributor to the metabolic acid\u2013base changes, according to the SIM, was chloride (P \u003C0.001). Severely-affected animals tended to demonstrate hypochloraemic alkalosis, whereas mildly-affected puppies had a hyperchloraemic acidosis (P =0.007). In conclusion, the acid\u2013base disturbances in CPV enteritis are multifactorial and complex, with the SIM providing information in terms of the origin of these changes.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burchell, Richard K.; Schoeman, Johan P.; Leisewitz, Andrew L.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/444139f42a123635d16c1a93223a40a1dbd1b188.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128572.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023314000422; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023314000422; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.01.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIM","CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["base changes","base disturbances","SIM","confirmed CPV enteritis","CPV-enteritis group","metabolic acid","severe acid","puppies","base excess algorithm","effects of changes","present study","chloride","retrospective data","clinical score","clinical severity","Hasselbalch model","pathological mechanisms","modified strong ion model","canine parvoviral","important contributor","healthy control dogs","free water","lactate","information","modification","classification","terms","individual component","phosphate","perturbations","albumin","origin","hyperchloraemic acidosis","insights","conclusion","hypochloraemic alkalosis","animals","Henderson","addition","patient","hypothesis","purpose"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The evaluation was a prospective simulation. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill as mock patients. RESULTS: Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH. The electronic chief complaint for 24 (57%) of these patients indicated febrile or respiratory illness. The drill did not generate a statistical signal in the NYC-DOHMH SaTScan analysis. The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 hierarchical categories based on chief complaints: sepsis (2), cold (3), diarrhea (2), respiratory (20), fever/flu (4), vomit (3), and other (8). The number of respiratory visits, while elevated on the day of the drill, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used for spatial analyses.

Equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients. Herein, we report results from a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host. The reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of each assay were evaluated and were found to exhibit analytic sensitivity that was similar to that of quantitative assays used to perform viral load testing of human viruses in clinical laboratories. This analytical approach was used to detect nucleic acids of infectious agents present in specimens from 9 sows and 22 piglets derived by caesarean section. The most commonly detected targets in adult animals were Mycoplasma species and two distinct herpesviruses, porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus 2 and 3.

Given their impact on human and agricultural health, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying immunocompetence in this reservoir host. To date, few studies have examined immune function in the Order Chiroptera, particularly among natural colonies of bats. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test has been widely used to measure delayed-type cellular immune response in a wide variety of vertebrates, and has been routinely employed in immunoecological studies. Although this test is frequently described as a measure of T cell proliferation, recent studies indicate it may represent a combination of immune responses. In mammals, the immune response is differentially, temporally and spatially regulated, therefore, we characterized the infiltrating leukocyte response to the PHA skin test in bats by examining a time-series of histological sections from PHA and saline injection areas in 41 Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Results suggest that bats exhibit diverse leukocyte traffic within 6 h, and up to 24 h following subcutaneous PHA injection. There was a significant presence of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages observed in the PHA-injected tissues, compared with saline-injected control tissues. We observed a highly significant negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in PHA-injected tissue, with peak lymphocyte response at 12 h, and peak neutrophil response at 24 h post-injection. These results indicate substantial variation in the immune response of individuals, and may aid our understanding of disease emergence in natural populations of bats.","publish_time":"2010-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turmelle, Amy S.; Ellison, James A.; Mendon\u00E7a, Mary T.; McCracken, Gary F.","journal":"J Comp Physiol B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7e51348da71b6097b982610c3dadb9154e4651c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088081.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00360-010-0486-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20549214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHA"],"locations":["Antarctica"],"keyphrases":["immune response of individuals","PHA-injected tissues","PHA skin test","subcutaneous PHA injection","peak neutrophil response","peak lymphocyte response","infiltrating leukocyte response","natural populations of bats","natural colonies of bats","immune function","delayed-type cellular immune response","h post-injection","combination of immune responses","Brazilian free-tailed bats","saline injection areas","saline-injected control tissues","neutrophils","recent studies","Results","immunoecological studies","significant presence of lymphocytes","number of lymphocytes","diverse leukocyte traffic","significant negative correlation","measure of T cell proliferation","numerous emerging infectious diseases","histological sections","unique ecological niches","reservoirs","understanding of disease emergence","Order Chiroptera","time-series","wide variety of vertebrates","Tadarida brasiliensis","substantial variation","agricultural health","mechanisms","immunocompetence","macrophages","impact","reservoir host","eosinophils","phytohemagglutinin","basophils","date","mammals","Antarctica"],"language":"en"},

Random-effects models were adopted to estimate the overall relative risk. Fourteen articles involving more than 19000 COVID-19 cases were included. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.04; P = 0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of severity (OR = 0.98; 95%CI 0.87-1.09; P = 0.69) or mortality (OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.5-1.07; P = 0.111).

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G\u002BC content of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was approximately 60.2\u201391.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts. As the nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus.","publish_time":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tse, Herman; Tsang, Alan K. L.; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Leung, Andy S.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 disease as well as to highlight essential measures that healthcare providers and surgeons need to take into consideration during their management of the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Balas, Mahmoud; Al-Balas, Hasan Ibrahim; Al-Balas, Hamzeh","journal":"Am J Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71ce05feff965eace98440f275d560448888f3bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334800/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002961020302221; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.04.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961020302221","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic disease","Abstract COVID","comprehensive overview of COVID","global incidence of COVID","health care providers","ill patients","extensive contact","healthcare providers","close contact","health systems","surgeons","families","standard treatment","single-stranded RNA virus","essential measures","nCoV","affected people","Medical staff","coronavirus family","terms","capability","consideration","droplets","safe environment","management","SARS-CoV","cross-infection","paper"],"language":"en"},

Many public health and clinical teams will increasingly use WGS to investigate clusters of potential pathogen transmission, making it crucial to understand the benefits and assumptions of the analytical methods for investigating the data. We aimed to understand how different approaches affect inferences of transmission dynamics and outline limitations of the methods. METHODS: We comprehensively searched electronic databases for studies that presented methods used to interpret WGS data for investigating tuberculosis (TB) transmission. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Due to considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies, we present summary data with accompanying narrative synthesis rather than pooled analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. Despite the range of interpretation tools, the usefulness of WGS data in understanding TB transmission often depends on the amount of genetic diversity in the setting. Where diversity is small, distinguishing re-infections from relapses may be impossible; interpretation may be aided by the use of epidemiological data, examining minor variants and deep sequencing. Conversely, when within-host diversity is large, due to genetic hitchhiking or co-infection of two dissimilar strains, it is critical to understand how it arose. Greater understanding of microevolution and mixed infection will enhance interpretation of WGS data. CONCLUSIONS: As sequencing studies have sampled more intensely and integrated multiple sources of information, the understanding of TB transmission and diversity has grown, but there is still much to be learnt about the origins of diversity that will affect inferences from these data. Public health teams and researchers should combine epidemiological, clinical and WGS data to strengthen investigations of transmission.

AIM: We explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission (foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease [FMD]) between cattle and the African buffalo (the maintenance host) and how a top predator, the lion, may modulate these interactions. LOCATION: The interface of Hwange National Park (HNP) and surrounding communal lands, Zimbabwe. METHOD: We combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for FMD, GPS\u2010collar data and cattle owners\u2019 interviews during four seasons in 2010\u20132011. RESULTS: Overall FMD incidence in cattle was low, but showed a peak during the rainy season. The incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area (i.e., buffer zone of 3 km inside HNP) and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle. These results suggest that FMD virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species. The analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that (1) buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that (2) lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions. Lions could thus reduce the spatio\u2010temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface, which could contribute to the low level of FMD incidence. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: During the rainy season, traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the HNP but not during the dry season, suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the HNP.

Maternal immunity via colostrum and milk is a vital source to neonates of passive protection against diarrhea, dehydration and death caused by PEDV. Comprehensive information on neutralizing activity (NA) against PEDV in mammary secretions is critically important for assessing the protective capacity of sows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize anti-PEDV neutralizing activity in mammary secretions. Anti-PEDV NA was present in colostrum, milk and serum from PEDV-infected sows as determined both by immunofluorescence and ELISA-based neutralizing assays, with neutralization levels higher in colostrum and milk than in serum. The highest NA was observed in colostrum on day 1, and decreased rapidly in milk at day 3, then gradually declined from day 3 to day 19 post-farrowing. Notably, the NA in mammary secretions showed various patterns of decline over time of lactation that may contribute to variation in sow protective capacities. The kinetics of NA decline were associated with total IgA and IgG antibody levels. Neutralizing activity significantly correlated with specific IgA primarily to spike domain 1 (S1) and domain 2 (S2) proteins of PEDV rather than to specific IgG in colostrum. Subsequently, the NA in milk was mainly related to specific IgA to S1 and S2 during lactation.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Qinye; Stone, Suzanne; Drebes, Donna; Greiner, Laura L.; Dvorak, Cheryl M.T.; Murtaugh, Michael P.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1daa45740b0073b912fc0d6f16a9fe905b3f2707.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126973.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021630154X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27287711/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021630154X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Anti-PEDV NA","colostrum","milk","proteins of PEDV","day","highest NA","neutralizing activity","PEDV-infected sows","specific IgA","mammary secretions","kinetics of NA decline","neutralizing assays","specific IgG","total IgA","domain","S2","serum","S1","IgG antibody levels","protective capacity of sows","suckling neonates","time of lactation","neonates of passive protection","various patterns of decline","neutralization levels higher","sow protective capacities","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pork industry","severe clinical enteric disease","vital source","devastating economic losses","immunofluorescence","dehydration","mortality","variation","death","Comprehensive information","recent years","ELISA","study","post-farrowing","Maternal immunity","objectives"],"language":"en"},

About half are due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 80% occur in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, low-cost therapies would be invaluable. Although glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appear to be promising in AMI, the available trials are inconclusive and these treatments require rigorous evaluation. Methods The Clinical Trial of Reviparin and Metabolic Modulation in Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment and Evaluation-Estudios Cl\u00EDnicos Latino America (CREATE-ECLA) study is a randomized controlled trial in ST-elevation AMI patients evaluating a 24-hour infusion of Glucose-Insulin-Potassium (GIK) intravenous vs usual care (control) on 30-day mortality in 20 000 patients from 21 countries. Patients from India and China (n = 15 000) are also randomized using a factorial design to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Reviparin) or placebo injection twice daily for 7 days to assess the impact on the composite outcomes of death, reinfarction or stroke (first co-primary outcome) or the composite \u002B refractory ischemia (second co-primary outcome). Results Twenty thousand two hundred and one (20,201) GIK/control patients and 15,570 Reviparin/placebo patients have been included, with results expected in November 2004. Conclusions The CREATE-ECLA trial will provide definitive answers to the role of 2 practical, promising and low-cost therapies, LMWH and GIK, in AMI patients. If effective, these therapies could be used in small medical centers in low- and middle- income countries. The experiences in this trial indicate that large trials of important questions can be successfully conducted in resource-poor settings, by academic groups without industry involvement.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yusuf, Salim; Mehta, Shamir R.; D\u00EDaz, Rafael; Paolasso, Ernesto; Pais, Prem; Xavier, Denis; Xie, Changchun; Ahmed, Rashid J.; Khazmi, Khawar; Zhu, Jun; Liu, Lisheng","journal":"American Heart Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00d1165856c978d9b09bee5e0a1fbca063df6c4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118878.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870304005939; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870304005939","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Evaluation-Estudios Cl\u00EDnicos Latino America","AMI","GIK"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["GIK","control patients","placebo patients","low-molecular","ECLA trial","ST-elevation AMI patients","Clinical Trial of Reviparin","low-cost therapies","randomized controlled trial","Insulin-Potassium","weight heparin","co-primary outcome","glucose-insulin","LMWH","middle-income countries","Results","Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment","hour infusion of Glucose","middle- income countries","rigorous evaluation","placebo injection","available trials","composite outcomes of death","large trials of important questions","Evaluation-Estudios Cl\u00EDnicos Latino America","Metabolic Modulation","stroke","reinfarction","intravenous vs usual care","academic groups","refractory ischemia","deaths","treatments","study","definitive answers","resource-poor settings","small medical centers","impact","cardiovascular diseases","industry involvement","day mortality","year","role","days","India","China","factorial design","half","Methods","Abstract Background","experiences","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of co-infection between respiratory pathogens including viruses, bacteria and atypical bacteria in a sample of Egyptian children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. METHODS: This one-year prospective cohort study conducted in Abo El Rish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University over one year included children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Enrolled children were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs and then processed to detect viral, bacterial and atypical bacterial causative agents by culture), retrotranscription polymerase, Monoplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral etiological agents were detected in 20 cases (20.8%), while 76 patients (79.2%) had no definite viral aetiology. The most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B. For Atypical bacterial causes Mycoplasma were positive for 9 (6.8%) cases and one case was positive for Bordetella parapertussis. Viral and atypical bacteria Co infection were detected in 14 (10.6%) of cases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coinfection with bacteria or atypical bacteria in children with acute respiratory tract infection is common and this co-infection can induce serious illness. The multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction should become an essential tool for epidemiological studies and can fill the gap between clinical presentation and definitive diagnosis.","publish_time":"2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baroudy, Nevine R.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(6), 922\u2013931. Background Few drugs are currently licensed to treat influenza A infection, and new therapies are needed, especially for highly pathogenic strains. Traditional medicinal plants, such as Lycoris radiata, are a potential source of new antiviral agents. Objective To test 15 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids isolated from the bulbs of L. radiata in vitro for antiviral activities against influenza virus type A, A/Chicken/GuangDong/178/2004 (H5N1, 178). Methods Antiviral activities of the compounds were tested in time\u2010of\u2010addition assays, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, neuraminidase (NA) activity assays, and viral entry inhibition assays using H5N1\u2010HIV pseudoviruses. Effects of the compounds on localization and activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) were determined by immunofluorescence and an RNP minigenome assay, respectively. Results Among the alkaloids, lycorine (AA1), hippeastrine (AA2), hemanthamine (AA3) and 11\u2010hydroxy vittatine (AA4) exhibited antiviral activities, with EC(90) values of 0\u00B752, 82\u00B707, 4\u00B715, and 13\u00B745 \u03BCm, respectively. These compounds did not affect the function of the outer membrane proteins or the viral entry process and viral RNP activity. As AA1 and AA3 exhibited stronger antiviral activities, they were further analyzed. Intracellular nucleoprotein (NP) localization showed that AA1 and AA3 inhibited the RNP complex in the nucleus at an early stage of a single\u2010round and multi\u2010round of replication. Conclusion Four Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were first determined that could exert anti\u2010influenza activities after virus entry into cells. Furthermore, AA1 and AA3 could inhibit nuclear\u2010to\u2010cytoplasmic export of the RNP complex of virus replication. Thus, these compounds may be developed further as anti\u2010influenza drug candidates.","publish_time":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Jun; Qi, Wen\u2010Bao; Wang, Lei; Tian, Jin; Jiao, Pei\u2010Rong; Liu, Guo\u2010Qian; Ye, Wen\u2010Cai; Liao, Ming","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4305e4ee478f16759146ed5ae853e0ea5b017cdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634243.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNP activity","anti\u2010influenza activities","AA1","AA3","compounds","RNP complex of virus replication","influenza virus type","stronger antiviral activities","Methods Antiviral activities","activity assays","virus entry","Amaryllidaceae alkaloids","viral entry inhibition assays","pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1","viral ribonucleoprotein","viral entry process","RNP minigenome assay","addition assays","anti\u2010influenza drug candidates","localization","potential source of new antiviral agents","cytoplasmic export of ribonucleoprotein","multi\u2010round of replication","hemagglutination inhibition","Lycoris radiata","new therapies","pathogenic strains","neuraminidase","outer membrane proteins","early stage","hydroxy vittatine","HIV pseudoviruses","hippeastrine","function","infection","Chicken","lycorine","AA2","nucleus","AA4","immunofluorescence","bulbs of","Traditional medicinal plants","cells","Intracellular nucleoprotein","hemanthamine","Objective","test","time","GuangDong","Results","Respiratory Viruses","drugs","Effects","Conclusion","values","paper","\u03BCm"],"language":"en"},

Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes\u2019 true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.","publish_time":"2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia, Victor; Zoller, Stefan; Anisimova, Maria","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9503694069cf157e33e29033469edc8d1794a35e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6169388.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111621/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CUB indices","PRF signals","translational selection","PRF efficiencies","PRF events","translational cost","translational efficiency hypothesis","corrected CUB index","TEH","protein expression levels","translation efficiency","important translational disruption effect","organisms","accuracy constraints","corrections","synonymous mutations","important consequences","levels of uniform","synonymous codons","Experimental evidence","genes\u2019 true adaptation","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","useful tool","relationships","codon usage bias","tests neglect","correlation","genetic fitness","amino acid","distinct frequency","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","tree of life","genomes"],"language":"en"},

Currently, treatment options for patients with viral infection are limited, but there is ongoing research on the development and clinical testing of new treatment regimens and strategies.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavallazzi, Rodrigo; Ramirez, Julio A.","journal":"Clinics in Chest Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fbec1c7323733fc426b2773e3ba37491a01313f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116973.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272523118300844; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272523118300844; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccm.2018.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30390743/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial pneumonia","treatment options","radiological findings of viral infection","immunocompromised patients","infection control measures","clinical testing of new treatment regimens","identification of respiratory viruses","advent of polymerase chain reaction testing","important implications","development","strategies","ongoing research","community","hospital","Influenza"],"language":"en"},

Depending on the virulence, the velogenic NDV strains cause severe respiratory and nervous disorders with a high mortality rate. The live and killed vaccines are available for the prevention of infection in the market, but the drug for the treatment is not available. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a member of thiazolides, is an antiparasitic drug. In the present study, the effect of NTZ on the NDV replication was explored. The experiments were conducted in chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), PBMC, embryonated chicken eggs, and two-week old chickens. The inhibition of the NDV was observed upon post-treatment of NTZ at a concentration of ~12.5 \u03BCM. Cytokine profiling of the DF-1, PBMC, and chicken embryonic tissue treated with NTZ revealed significant upregulation in all the cytokines studied except for IL-1\u03B2 in DF-1 cells. It is plausible that NTZ is involved in causing immune-modulatory effects in poultry. NTZ treatment in two weeks old chicken showed significant reduction in NDV replication in trachea, and lungs, respectively, at 72 h post-infection. Encouraging results from the present study warrants repurposing NTZ as a drug for the treatment of viral infection in poultry. It will also pave the way towards understanding of similar effect against other animal pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antony, Ferrin; Vashi, Yoya; Morla, Sudhir; Vandna; Mohan, Hari; Kumar, Sachin","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32ba7839296537e72e19f0f651573968dc8fb608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196422.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466620301319?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403005/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155115; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466620301319","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","NTZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NTZ treatment","effect of NTZ","post-treatment of NTZ","repurposing NTZ","NDV replication","DF","weeks old chicken","chicken fibroblast cells","treatment of viral infection","embryonated chicken eggs","chicken embryonic tissue","velogenic NDV strains","PBMC","present study","antiparasitic drug","prevention of infection","poultry","h post-infection","significant reduction","significant upregulation","similar effect","two-week old chickens","nervous disorders","trachea","high mortality rate","cytokines","pheasant","ostrich","pigeon","lungs","member of thiazolides","concentration","avian paramyxovirus serotype","immune-modulatory effects","APMV","wild birds","Newcastle disease","waterfowl","vaccines","animal pathogens","virulence","results","market","experiments","way","Cytokine profiling","Nitazoxanide","\u03BCM","inhibition"],"language":"en"},

These positive strand RNA viruses encode a replicase polyprotein that is processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The nsps assemble with membranes to generate double membrane vesicles, which are the sites of viral RNA synthesis. MHV nsp3 contains multiple domains including two papain-like protease domains, PLP1 and PLP2, and a predicted transmembrane (TM) domain. In this study, we determined the membrane topology of nsp3-TM and showed that TM-mediated tethering of PLP2 is important for processing at cleavage site 3. Biochemical analysis revealed that nsp3 is an integral membrane protein that is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes co-translationally and glycosylated at asparagine-2357. Proteinase K digestion experiments indicate that the TM domain of nsp3 has 4 membrane-spanning helices. We show that nsp3-TM is sufficient in mediating ER membrane association of a cytosolic protein.

The protein comprises a single \u03B2-barrel with a fold previously unseen in single domain proteins. The fold superficially resembles an OB-fold with a C-terminal extension and is related to both of the two subdomains of the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (which belongs to the serine protease superfamily). nsp9 has, presumably, evolved from a protease.

The effect of depleting serum IgG by pre-treatment with protein G agarose (PGA) was evaluated. Following primary infection a weak IgM response was detected in the untreated sera of 3 out of 4 calves with maternally derived antibody (MDA). Both the magnitude and duration of the specific IgM responses in these calves were increased by pre-treatment with PGA. In addition, the fourth infected calf tested gave a single positive IgM result following PGA treatment. Transient or persistent IgM responses which were abolished by pre-treatment of sera with PGA were detected in 4/8 calves following reinfection. These were considered to be false positive results, consistent with the influence of IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF). One of these calves and two additional calves showed transient increases in IgM which were resistant to PGA treatment. These were considered to represent specific IgM responses to reinfection. The results indicate the ability of PGA treatment to eliminate both false positive and false negative results and emphasise the necessity for controlling the influence of IgM-RF in IgM-specific indirect ELISAs.","publish_time":"1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, D.

Well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described, the large majority since 1993, and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans. Hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts, and in the Americas, human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with case-fatality ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%. Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present.

The participants were randomly assigned to two groups, Reduqing (RDQ) group and Lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) group, in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in RDQ group received Reduqing granules and dummy Lianhuaqingwen capsules three times a day and patients in LHQW group received Lianhuaqingwen capsules and dummy Reduqing granules three times daily. The duration of treatment and follow-up were four days. Results There were no statistically significant differences in total markedly effective rate and total effective rate between RDQ group and LHQW group after treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptom score was significantly reduced after treatment in RDQ group, as well as in LHQW group. However, the difference of change in TCM symptom score between two groups was not statistically significant (P \u003E 0.05). There were no significant differences between two groups in the median time to fever relief [RDQ group (4 \u00B1 8) h vs LHQW group (4 \u00B1 5) h] or the median time to fever clearance (RDQ group 47 h vs LHQW 36 h).

This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robba, Chiara; Robba, Chiara; Battaglini, Denise; Ball, Lorenzo; Patroniti, Nicolo\u2019; Loconte, Maurizio; Brunetti, Iole; Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele; Bassetti, Matteo; Rocco, Patricia Rieken Macedo; Pelosi, Paolo","journal":"Respir Physiol Neurobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb6676553d2a43dd7ad63f8021656e7bf1197276.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211757.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569904820301130?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437877/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resp.2020.103455; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1569904820301130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory management of COVID","chest CT patterns","respiratory mechanics","severe respiratory failure","ARDS","clinical presentation of COVID","patients","use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies","chest computed tomography","typical acute respiratory distress syndrome","overperfused ground-glass opacities","multiple","brief guidance","recent literature","different treatments","microemboli","direct experience","inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis","attention","ventilator settings","abnormalities","main phenotypes","risk of pulmonary embolism","population","manuscript","Coronavirus disease","research","hypothesis","time"],"language":"en"},

Design \u0026 methods A total of 2787 family and non-family visitors entering through the glass sliding door of 6 pediatric wards at a university children\u0027s hospital were observed for 4 h, respectively, before and after interventions between April 27 and May 20, 2018. In the first intervention, a visual stimulus emphasized the location of the hand sanitizer. In the second intervention, an additional auditory stimulus transmitted a cue through a motion sensor speaker. Results During the preliminary observation, the HHC rates of family and non-family visitors were 0.0% and 1.5%, respectively; after the visual stimulus, they were 0.6% and 5.4%, and after the audio-visual stimulus, 1.8% and 8.2%. There was a significant increase in the overall HHC with the visual (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.76\u201320.90) and audio-visual (OR, 8.67; 95% CI, 3.08\u201333.70) stimuli (Fisher\u0027s exact test, p \u003C .05). Conclusions The HHC of family and non-family visitors entering pediatric wards was very low and the audio-visual stimulus was found to be more effective than was the visual stimulus alone.

We evaluated the antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the \u2013 PRF signal. The ribosomal frameshifting was inhibited by the PNA, which bound sequence-specifically a pseudoknot structure in the \u22121 PRF signal, in cell lines as assessed using a dual luciferase-based reporter plasmid containing the \u22121 PRF signal. Treatment of cells, which were transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon expressing firefly luciferase, with the PNA fused to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) resulted in suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV replicon, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 \u03BCM. There was no induction of type I interferon responses by PNA treatment, suggesting that the effect of PNA is not due to innate immune responses.

These respiratory problems due to viral infection become a public health concern due to rapid transmission through air/aerosols or via direct-indirect contact with infected persons. In addition, the cross-species transmission causes alterations to viral genetic makeup thereby increasing the risk of emergence of pathogens with new and more potent infectivity. With the introduction of effective nucleic acid-based technologies, post translational gene silencing (PTGS) is being increasingly used to silence viral gene targets and has shown promising approach towards management of many viral infections. Since several host factors are also utilized by these viruses during various stages of infection, silencing these host factors can also serve as promising therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid-based technologies such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), and ribozymes have been studied and used against management of respiratory viruses. These therapeutic nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered through the airways. Studies have also shown efficacy of gene therapy in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as models of respiratory diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles and influenza. In this review, we have summarized some of the recent advancements made in the area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and highlighted the emerging roles of nucleic acids in the management of some of the severe respiratory viral infections.

The availability of complete nucleotide sequences for an increasing number of rhabdoviruses has revealed that their ecological diversity is reflected in the diversity and complexity of their genomes. The five canonical rhabdovirus structural protein genes (N, P, M, G and L) that are shared by all rhabdoviruses are overprinted, overlapped and interspersed with a multitude of novel and diverse accessory genes. Although not essential for replication in cell culture, several of these genes have been shown to have roles associated with pathogenesis and apoptosis in animals, and cell-to-cell movement in plants. Others appear to be secreted or have the characteristics of membrane-anchored glycoproteins or viroporins. However, most encode proteins of unknown function that are unrelated to any other known proteins. Understanding the roles of these accessory genes and the strategies by which rhabdoviruses use them to engage, divert and re-direct cellular processes will not only present opportunities to develop new anti-viral therapies but may also reveal aspects of cellar function that have broader significance in biology, agriculture and medicine.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Peter J.; Dietzgen, Ralf G.; Joubert, D.

Although previous studies have reported that \u03B1-/\u03B8-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic \u03B8-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid \u03B1-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of \u03B8-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.","publish_time":"2014-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Dong-Qiang; Li, Ying; Huang, Jing-Fei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/519b82201745afd08726b2c3e87cad65f8409da5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4018336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819937/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DEFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DEFT genes","loss of functional DEFT","simian DEFA","primate DEFA","DEFT gene repertoires","myeloid defensins","myeloid \u03B1-defensins","prosegment of \u03B8","primate \u03B1","functional gene clusters","\u03B8-defensin multigene family","emergence of cyclic \u03B8-defensins","functional constraints","simian cluster","birth","related species","antimicrobial spectrum","treeshrew","myeloid DEFA8","existence of similar antimicrobial spectra","subsequent loss of function","adjacent driver gene","death evolutionary process","rapid evolution","phylogenetic relationships","frequent duplication","Species-specific duplication","evolutionary processes","new protein fold of mature peptide","different selection pressures","amphipathic peptides","variable structures","Old World monkeys","diverged sequences","genetic bases","expansion of pseudogene DEFTP","possible explanation","chimpanzees","humans","adaptive changes","importance","tissue-specific","comparative genomics analyses","correct folding","gorillas","antiviral activity","hitchhiker","pseudogenization","major clades","gain","simians","study","hitchhiking hypothesis","ever-changing pathogen environment","investigation","previous studies"],"language":"en"},

These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac2. However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac2) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac2 from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feuerbaum, S.; Saile, N.; Pohlentz, G.; M\u00FCthing, J.; Schmidt, H.","journal":"International Journal of Medical Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106450.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438422118303692; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438422118303692; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2018.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BSM","EHEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylesterase NanS","nanS-p1a","tri-O","nanS deletion mutant","expected activity of NanS","de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac","NanS-p variants of EHEC O157","O-acetyl neuraminic acid","O-acetyl groups","derived O-acetylneuraminic acids","mammalian mucin O-glycans","release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac","expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases","mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids","N-acetyl","EHEC wildtype strain EDL933","H7 strain EDL933","Neu5Gc","9Ac2","enhanced growth of EDL933","N-glycolylneuraminic acid","EHEC colonization","treatment of BSM","mucin glycans","exogenous BTSA","presence of BTSA","p7 mutant","combination of BTSA","neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac","nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids","Initial HPTLC analyses","bovine submaxillary glands mucin","Growth experiments","enzyme activity","tested enzymes","carbon positions C7","nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","C8","C9","layer chromatography","recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase","gut microbiota","evidence","competition","advantage","nutrients","Abstract Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli","broad specificity","derivatives","human large intestine","acetate esters","copies of prophage","mono","test system","nitrogen source","current study"],"language":"en"},

Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response. All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM). Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells. The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3). Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow\u2013derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection. These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a SARS-CoV-specific immune response in individuals with severe disease.","publish_time":"2009-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jincun; Zhao, Jingxian; Van Rooijen, Nico; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab23c1ed37392d4e2dbbd809e62171775e75369b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2762542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19851468/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory disease","severe disease","T cells","c mice","transit of respiratory dendritic cells","lung dendritic cells","derived dendritic cells","human disease","Inhibitory AMs","delayed development","development of immune responses","specific immune response","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","prolonged virus persistence","mortality","consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response","slow kinetics of virus clearance","delayed activation","allergic responses","SARS-CoV","substantial morbidity","high morbidity","inhibitory effects","lethal MA15 infection","BMDC","DLN","environmental antigens","individuals","bone marrow","draining lymph nodes","mouse-adapted version","toll","clodronate","BALB","receptors","rDCs","liposomes","poly","alveolar macrophages","TLR3","results","humans","features","adoptive transfer","epidemic","defects"],"language":"en"},

Upon binding to double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA, OAS proteins and cGAS produce nucleotide second messengers to activate RNase L and STING (stimulator of interferon genes, gene symbol: TMEM173), respectively; this leads to the initiation of antiviral responses. We analyzed the evolutionary history of the MB21D1\u2013TMEM173 and OAS\u2013RNASEL axes in primates and bats and found evidence of widespread positive selection in both orders. In TMEM173, residue 230, a major determinant of response to natural ligands and to mimetic drugs (e.g., DMXAA), was positively selected in Primates and Chiroptera. In both orders, selection also targeted an \u03B1-helix/loop element in RNase L that modulates the enzyme preference for single-stranded RNA versus stem loops. Analysis of positively selected sites in OAS1, OAS2, and MB21D1 revealed parallel evolution, with the corresponding residues being selected in different genes. As this cannot result from gene conversion, these data suggest that selective pressure acting on OAS and MB21D1 genes is related to nucleic acid recognition and to the specific mechanism of enzyme activation, which requires a conformational change. Finally, a population genetics-phylogenetics analysis in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas detected several positively selected sites in most genes.

The objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. RESULTS: In this study, visual RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was performed in one step with the addition of hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and were used to detect respiratory samples. Six primers, including two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed for hMPV N gene by the online software. Moreover, the RT-LAMP assay showed good specificity and no cross-reactivity was observed with human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial Virus (RSV), or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately ten viral RNA copies, lower than that of traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 100 RNA copies. In the 176 nasopharyngeal samples, 23 (13.1%) were conformed as hMPV positive by RT-LAMP, but 18 (10.2%) positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional RT-PCR, the visual hMPV RT-LAMP assay performed well in the aspect of detect time, sensitivity, specificity and visibility. It is anticipated that the RT-LAMP will be used for clinical tests in hospital or field testing during outbreaks and in emergency.","publish_time":"2012-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiang; Zhang, Qian; Zhang, Fang; Ma, Fenlian; Zheng, Wenzhi; Zhao, Zhihui; Bai, Yinglong; Zheng, Lishu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c19aadb1294d6b98fc8b947a98eefac0da6b870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3487928.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22838725/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["visual RT-LAMP assay","visual hMPV RT-LAMP assay","conventional RT-PCR","detection of hMPV","hMPV positive","loop primers","respiratory samples","hMPV N gene","inner primers","outer primers","clinical samples","human respiratory syncytial Virus","visual reverse transcription loop","human rhinovirus","Human metapneumovirus","study","nasopharyngeal samples","viral RNA copies","good specificity","influenza virus","clinical tests","detection limit","major cause of acute respiratory infections","traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","isothermal amplification","field testing","wheezing","RSV","HRV","hospital","bronchiolitis","cross-reactivity","B3","BIP","addition of hydroxynaphthol blue","outbreaks","time","sensitivity","F3","step","online software","FIP","aspect","HNB","pneumonia","children","emergency","visibility","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","LF","H1N1","objective"],"language":"en"},

The mIAP pseudoknot is an H-type pseudoknot proposed to have structural features in common with the gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknots from simian retrovirus-1 (SRV-1) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In particular, the mIAP pseudoknot is proposed to contain an unpaired adenosine base at the junction of the two helical stems (A15), as well as one in the middle of stem 2 (A35). A mutational analysis of stem 1 hairpins and compensatory base-pair substitutions incorporated into helical stem 2 was used to assign optical melting transitions to molecular unfolding events. The optical melting profile of the wild-type RNA is most simply described by four sequential two-state unfolding transitions. Stem 2 melts first in two closely coupled low-enthalpy transitions at low t m in which the stem 3\u2032 to A35, unfolds first, followed by unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem. The third unfolding transition is associated with some type of stacking interactions in the stem 1 hairpin loop not present in the pseudoknot. The fourth transition is assigned to unfolding of stem 1. In all RNAs nvestigated, \u0394H vH \u2248\u0394H cal, suggesting that \u0394C p for unfolding is small. A35 has the thermodynamic properties expected for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide. Deletion of A15 destabilizes the stem 2 unfolding transition in the context of both the wild-type and \u0394A35 mutant RNAs only slightly, by \u0394\u0394G\u00B0\u22481 kcal mol\u22121 (at 37 \u00B0C). The \u0394A15 RNA is considerably more susceptible to thermal denaturation in the presence of moderate urea concentrations than is the wild-type RNA, further evidence of a detectable global destabilization of the molecule. Interestingly, substitution of the nine loop 2 nucleotides with uridine residues induces a more pronounced destabilization of the molecule (\u0394\u0394G\u00B0\u22482.0 kcal mol\u22121), a long-range, non-nearest neighbor effect. These findings provide the thermodynamic basis with which to further refine the relationship between efficient ribosomal frameshifting and pseudoknot structure and stability.","publish_time":"1999-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theimer, Carla A.; Giedroc, David P.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aa202db5dcaee14391c9703e98db1829027d9b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126474.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699928504; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283699928504","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["middle of stem","mIAP pseudoknot","wild-type RNA","H-type pseudoknot","mutational analysis of stem","state unfolding transitions","nucleotide frameshifting RNA pseudoknot","type particles","pseudoknot structure","molecular unfolding events","optical melting transitions","type of stacking interactions","\u0394A15 RNA","optical melting profile","equilibrium thermal melting profiles","gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknots","\u0394\u0394G","low-enthalpy transitions","molecule","unpaired nucleotide","helical stems","kcal mol","gag-pro junction of mouse intracisternal","analysis of dual optical wavelength","efficient ribosomal frameshifting","unpaired adenosine base","thermal denaturation","\u0394H cal","low t","pronounced destabilization","\u0394H vH","simian retrovirus","hairpin loop","endogenous retrovirus","thermodynamic properties","Deletion of A15","thermodynamic basis","detectable global destabilization","\u0394A35 mutant RNAs","compensatory base-pair substitutions","mouse mammary tumor virus","hairpins","evidence","differential scanning calorimetry","presence of moderate urea concentrations","uridine residues","\u0394C p","structural features","context","non-nearest neighbor effect","nucleotides","MMTV","SRV","extrahelical","relationship","stability","pathway","findings","melts","remainder"],"language":"en"},

However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Ben; Zeng, Lei-Ping; Yang, Xing-Lou; Ge, Xing-Yi; Zhang, Wei; Li, Bei; Xie, Jia-Zheng; Shen, Xu-Rui; Zhang, Yun-Zhi; Wang, Ning; Luo, Dong-Sheng; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Wang, Mei-Niang; Daszak, Peter; Wang, Lin-Fa; Cui, Jie; Shi, Zheng-Li","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a2c3991a18171055b98f12c29a2c1f5d5fef1bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5708621.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29190287/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["human SARS-CoV","discovered SARSr-CoV strains","SARS coronavirus","evolution of SARS","identified SARSr-CoVs","direct progenitor of SARS","discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs","future emergence of SARS","large number of SARS","year surveillance of SARSr","cave","S gene","different S protein sequences","different genes","ORF8 region","Recombination analysis","sequential recombination events","S1 gene","different areas of China","evidence of frequent recombination events","receptor-binding domain","non-structural protein genes ORF1a","multiple species of horseshoe bats","human ACE2","related coronaviruses","previous findings","hypervariable N-terminal domain","NTD","sequence differences","origin","Yunnan Province","RBD","necessity of preparedness","ORF3b","high genetic similarity","precursors","new insights","close relationship","single location","work","Cell entry studies","diseases","full-length genomes","split ORF8a","addition"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors (rADVs) infect mucosa surface and therefore can serve as a mucosal antigen delivery vehicle. In this study we examined whether s.l. immunization with rADV encoding spike protein (S) (rADV-S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV and could serve as a safe mucosal route for delivery of rADV. RESULTS: Here, we show that s.l. administration of rADV-S induced serum SARS-CoV neutralizing and airway IgA antibodies in mice. These antibody responses are comparable to those induced by intranasal (i.n.) administration. In addition, s.l. immunization induced antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell responses in the lungs that are superior to those induced by intramuscular immunization. Importantly, unlike i.n. administration, s.l. immunization with rADV did not redirect the rADV vector to the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that s.l. immunization with rADV-S is safe and effective in induction of a broad spectrum of immune responses and presumably protection against infection with SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2012-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shim, Byoung-Shik; Stadler, Konrad; Nguyen, Huan Huu; Yun, Cheol-Heui; Kim, Dong Wook; Chang, Jun; Czerkinsky, Cecil; Song, Man Ki","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2ca7959b768af6c0ac1f5e347a31dacf9fcfd2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3489719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995185/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-215","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rADV-S","administration of rADV","delivery of rADV","rADV vector","S induced serum SARS-CoV","intramuscular immunization","broad immune responses","antibody responses","safe mucosal route","broad spectrum of immune responses","mucosal antigen delivery vehicle","T cell responses","extra-mucosal tissues","administration of soluble protein antigens","study","spike protein","antigen-specific CD8","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","rADVs","inactivated viruses","induction","protection","Recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors","airway IgA antibodies","infection","protective immunity","lungs","mucosa surface","mice","particles","Sublingual","olfactory bulb","BACKGROUND","addition","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study was to investigate the preventive effects of CHCP on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by hemorrhagic shock plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation (two-hit) and LPS-induced fever in rats. CHCP significantly attenuated pulmonary injury in the \u201Ctwo-hit\u201D ALI model by reducing pulmonary edema and protein exudation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, it reduced the deposit of complement activation products in the lung and improved oxidant-antioxidant imbalance.

Our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera bats. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found. Furthermore, additional Pteropodid hosts were detected. The astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus Mamastrovirus, most closely related to other known bat astroviruses. The astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully. An astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts, including from ungulates and porcupines, was found in a Rousettus bat.

Thirty-nine PEDV na\u00EFve pigs were randomly divided into five groups: EXP-IM-1b (intramuscular G1b exposure; G2b challenge), EXP-ORAL-1b (oral G1b exposure; G2b challenge), VAC-IM-2b (intramuscular commercial inactivated G2b vaccination; G2b challenge), POS-CONTROL (sham-vaccination; G2b challenge) and NEG-CONTROL (sham-vaccination; sham-challenge).

Among all groups, VAC-IM-2b pigs had significantly higher anti-PEDV IgG levels on dpv 21 and 28 while EXP-ORAL-1b pigs had significantly higher anti-PEDV IgA levels on dpv 14, 21, 28 and 35. EXP-ORAL-1b also had detectable IgA in feces. Intramuscular PEDV exposure did not result in a detectable antibody response in EXP-IM-1b pigs. The fecal PEDV RNA levels in VAC-IM-2b pigs were significantly lower 5\u20137 days after challenge compared to the POS-CONTROL group. Under the study conditions a commercial inactivated G2b-based vaccine protected pigs against G2b challenge, as evidenced by reduction of PEDV RNA in feces for 3\u20134 logs during peak shedding and a shorter viral shedding duration. The oral, but not the intramuscular, experimental G1b-based live virus exposure induced a high anti-PEDV IgA response prior to challenge, which apparently did not impact PEDV shedding compared to POS-CONTROL pigs.","publish_time":"2017-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opriessnig, Tanja; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Shen, Huigang; de Castro, Alessandra Marnie M.

In spite of proper vaccinations against the IBV, new IBV strains are continually emerging worldwide. In this study, a new highly virulent nephropathogenic IBV strain named CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was identified from a vaccinated flock with clinical signs of IB in the Jiangsu province of China. The full-length genome sequence of the isolate was 27,714 nucleotides long, and the genome was organized similarly to classical IBV strains. Minimum divergence, phylogenetic analysis, and distance matrix of the genome showed that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate had the highest similarity to the IBV BJ strain. The spike glycoprotein (S) gene had the greatest similarity to the nephropathogenic BJ strain and showed an 8 amino acid insertion (YSNGNSDV) at 73 to 80 sites and 3 amino acid deletion at sites 126 to 128 compared to the IBV vaccine strains. A recombination analysis of the S gene showed that the new isolate evolved from the IBV BJ strain and the KM91 vaccine strain. An animal challenge experiment showed a mortality of 60 to 80% in early-age chickens by different inoculation routes. Pathological examinations of the kidneys revealed inflammation, distention with uric acid deposits, and tubular degeneration. It indicated that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate has robust kidney tissue tropism, and new nephropathogenic IBV strains are continuously evolving in China.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leghari, R.

The antibody cocktail ZMapp\u2122, is remarkably effective against EBOV (Zaire), but does not cross-neutralize other ebolaviruses. By replacing one of the ZMapp\u2122 components with FVM04, we retained the anti-EBOV efficacy while extending the breadth of protection to SUDV, thereby generating a cross protective antibody cocktail.

However, past studies have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on the transmission of influenza in the construction of mathematical epidemic models. Therefore, this paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities on an influenza pandemic in a small-world network. These activities of air travel include passengers\u2019 consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights. Dynamic transmission models were developed to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic, with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of an air transportation network facilitate the spread of influenza around the globe. The results show that, as soon as the influenza is spread to the top 50 global airports, the transmission is greatly accelerated. Under the constraint of limited resources, a strategy that first applies control measures to the top 50 airports after day 13 and then soon afterwards to all other airports may result in remarkable containment effectiveness. As the infectiousness of the disease increases, it will expand the scale of the pandemic, and move the start time of the pandemic ahead.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsu, Chaug-Ing; Shih, Hsien-Hung","journal":"Accident Analysis \u0026 Prevention","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8423837b031f563d611815243521ba8e25b24b8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124216.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457509001717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887149/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001457509001717; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2009.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","spread of influenza","human transmission of influenza","activities of air travel","effects of air travel activities","air transportation network","global airports","serious pandemic threats","Dynamic transmission models","avian influenza virus H5N1","human health","small-world network","control measures","small-world properties","spread of infectious diseases","construction of mathematical epidemic models","conveyance","swine flu H1N1","passengers\u2019 consolidation","strategy","distribution","constraint of limited resources","remarkable containment effectiveness","flights","start time","disease increases","expected burdens","infectiousness","scale","globe","past studies","study","paper","day","results"],"language":"en"},

However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. STUDY DESIGN: RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPA-study) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. RESULTS: RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.","publish_time":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruning, Andrea H.L.; Thomas, Xiomara V.; van der Linden, Lonneke; Wildenbeest, Joanne G.; Minnaar, Ren\u00E9 P.; Jansen, Rogier R.; de Jong, Menno D.; Sterk, Peter J.; van der Schee, Marc P.; Wolthers, Katja C.; Pajkrt, Dasja","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d9010402bfd4162828fa2e26ef869c0715724e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.10.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215007295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599608/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215007295","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV-infected children","non-hospitalised children","RV types","RV-B","Clinical outcome of RV infected young children","distribution of RV species","symptomatic young children","predominant RV type","higher RV load","RV-typed samples","different characteristics of RV infections","epidemiological characteristics of RV infections","predominant species","clinical significance","EUROPA-study","study populations","STUDY DESIGN","associations","different rhinovirus","asymptomatic infection","respiratory distress","respiratory symptoms","bacterial co-infection","ICU-admission","underlying illness","Dutch birth cohort","epidemiology","CONCLUSIONS","host-specific","factors","data","studies","OBJECTIVES","aim","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Human adenovirus (HAdV) 3 and HAdV 7 cause major outbreaks of severe pneumonia. A reliable and practical method for HAdV typing in clinical laboratories is lacking. A simple, rapid and accurate molecular typing method for HAdV may facilitate clinical diagnosis and epidemiological control. METHODS: We developed and evaluated duplex real-time recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assays incorporating competitive internal controls for detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7, respectively. The assays were performed in a one-step in a single tube reaction at 39\u00B0 for 20 min. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivities of the duplex RAA assays for HAdV 3 and HAdV 7 were 5.0 and 14.8 copies per reaction, respectively (at 95% probability by probit regression analysis). No cross-reaction was observed with other types of HAdV or other common respiratory viruses. The duplex RAA assays were used to detect 152 previously-defined HAdV-positive samples. These results agreed with those obtained using a published triplex quantitative real-time PCR protocol. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first report of internally-controlled duplex RAA assays for the detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7. These assays effectively reduce the rate of false negative results and may be valuable for detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7 in clinical laboratories, especially in resource-poor settings.","publish_time":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Rui-huan; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Yi; Li, Xin-na; Shen, Xin-xin; Qi, Ju-ju; Fan, Guo-hao; Xiang, Xing-yu; Zhan, Zhi-fei; Chen, Zi-wei; Ma, Xue-jun","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55bf861b16d4b28c89750602b96b3827bdaf0055.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6604330.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1178-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of HAdV","types of HAdV","defined HAdV-positive samples","controlled duplex RAA assays","clinical laboratories","clinical diagnosis","duplex real-time recombinase-aided amplification","common group of viruses","common respiratory viruses","practical method","accurate molecular typing method","Human adenoviruses","rate of false negative results","single tube reaction","cause major outbreaks of severe pneumonia","published triplex quantitative real-time PCR protocol","competitive internal controls","analytical sensitivities","acute infectious diseases","one-step","report","epidemiological control","probability","probit regression analysis","resource-poor settings","BACKGROUND","copies","CONCLUSIONS","cross-reaction","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Although CF has been demonstrated to change the composition of lung microbial community, previous studies have not made efforts to study the differences in the mechanism of assembly and diversity maintenance of lung microbial community in CF patients. In this study, we applied the neutral theory of biodiversity to comparatively investigate the assembly and diversity maintenance of the lung microbial community before and after the antibiotic treatment by reanalyzing the dataset from Fodor et al\u0027s study. We found that no one sample in the lung microbial communities of the sputum samples of Exacerbation group, nor those of End-of-treatment group satisfied the predictions of neutral model, suggesting that the neutral-process does not dominate in CF patients before and after antibiotic treatments. By comparing the biodiversity parameter between Exacerbation and End-of-treatment group, we found that the former had the significantly higher biodiversity, but the change in diversity parameter is slight and the P value is close to.05 (P value = .41). Therefore, our second finding is that although CFPE may increase the biodiversity of lung microbial community, the change is not essential.","publish_time":"2018-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Qi; Wang, Yaqiang; Xia, Yao; Li, Lianwei; Luo, Juan; Xia, Shuxian; Sun, Yang; Miao, Yinglei; Wang, Kunhua; Chen, Ye","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61143198570c983e9975d2c20a361749d92396df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6156045.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212959/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000012248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","CFPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biodiversity of lung microbial community","diversity maintenance of lung microbial community","composition of lung microbial community","lung microbial communities","treatment group","biodiversity parameter","morbidity of CF patients","change","neutral theory of biodiversity","higher biodiversity","sputum samples of Exacerbation group","End","CFPE","Cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation","neutral-process","P value","predictions of neutral model","mechanism of assembly","Fodor et al\u0027s study","antibiotic treatments","chronic infection","airway obstruction","defective mucociliary clearance","dataset","previous studies","hereditary disease","persistent inflammation","efforts","differences","finding"],"language":"en"},

Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response. METHODS: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions. RESULTS: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yirong; Chu, Collins Wenhan; Chen, Mark I.C.; Cook, Alex R.","journal":"J Biomed Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/466fcea3e4725a13c1ad1ed64a39962601725030.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185473.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2018.02.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046418300339; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418300339","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different disease","different situations","different pathogens","different climates","importance of different predictors","different sets of predictors","different levels of importance","different model complexity","Prediction models","timely predictions","Climatic variables","public health agencies","Short term predictions","Separate LASSO models","important predictors","prediction accuracy","infectious disease forecasts","public health response","longer term predictions","useful forecasts","early stage of disease outbreaks","endemic infectious diseases","machine learning LASSO method","early warnings","short-notice","various conditions","control methods","Various approaches","outbreak size","forecast window","country","countries","capacity","effect","regions","apparent cyclicity","incidence","literature","weeks","INTRODUCTION","actual scenario","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","equator"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, African bats also carry other potentially zoonotic agents such as Henipah\u2010like viruses, coronaviruses and lyssaviruses. Today only little information is available on interactions between humans and bats. The objective of our exploratory study was to describe the extent and modes of contacts between humans and bats in southern Cameroon, considered as an area at risk for future EBV outbreaks. The survey was conducted in 11 villages of four distinct rural areas in southern Cameroon. A total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi\u2010structured questionnaires, between February and May 2017. The study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common. Bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource; 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three, and 28% of respondents hunt them. About 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats. Indirect contact also appeared to be common; 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats. Bat consumption varied significantly between regions (from 0% to 87%) and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme south\u2010east of Cameroon. The study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees, most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self\u2010hunted bushmeat. Geographical diversity of contacts and perceptions regarding bats in Cameroon emphasizes the need to adjust zoonotic pathogen surveillance and education campaigns to the specificities of the communities and their context of interaction with wildlife.","publish_time":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baudel, Helene; De Nys, Helene; Mpoudi Ngole, Eitel; Peeters, Martine; Desclaux, Alice","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/520e6589a7c10914c49b3ed2af83f5ef84bc5f3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677236/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["southern Cameroon","Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["African bats","respondents","humans","southern Cameroon","EBV reservoir","anti\u2010EBV antibodies","modes of contacts","direct contacts","future EBV outbreaks","Geographical diversity of contacts","extreme south\u2010east of Cameroon","interviewees","exploratory study","Bat bushmeat","Bat consumption","zoonotic agents","considerable diversity","zoonotic pathogen surveillance","self\u2010hunted bushmeat","median annual consumption","previous detection of viral RNA","education campaigns","specificities","distinct rural areas","interactions","extent","need","perceptions","communities","villages","subsistence cultivators","Henipah","bantus","risk","practices","occasional meat resource","context of interaction","little information","ecology of Ebola virus","coronaviruses","pygmies","hunters","shelters","semi\u2010structured questionnaires","caves","lyssaviruses","wildlife","Indirect contact","objective","role","regions","fruits","children","survey","total"],"language":"en"},

Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein, an indispensable component for efficient virus replication, can be used as a potential target for generating new antiviral agents. Here, we study the interaction of 2H6 monoclonal antibody with NS1 protein and also determine whether influenza virus replication can be inhibited by blocking NS1. The 2H6-antigen binding fragment (Fab) forms a multimeric complex with the NS1 RNA-binding domain (RBD). T49, a residue which forms a direct hydrogen bond with double stranded RNA, in NS1 protein was found to be critical for its interaction with 2H6 antibody. NS1(RBD) has high affinity to 2H6 with KD of 43.5\u00B14.24nM whereas NS1(RBD)-T49A has more than 250 times lower affinity towards 2H6. Interestingly, the intracellular expression of 2H6-single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in mammalian cells caused a reduction in viral growth and the M1 viral protein level was significantly reduced in 2H6-scFv transfected cells in comparison to vector transfected cells at 12h post infection.

In future, 2H6 antibody in combination with other neutralizing antibodies can be used to increase the potency of viral inhibition.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnwal, Bhaskar; Mok, Chee-Keng; Wu, Jianping; Diwakar, Mandakhalikar Kedar; Gupta, Garvita; Zeng, Qi; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Song, Jianxing; Yuan, Y.

We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies.

The necessity and feasibility of such a vaccine for human and veterinary application is discussed. Developmental stages within the life cycle of the parasite that might act as possible targets for vaccine development are summarised, as well as the target antigens offered by molecular biology and immunology studies. Vaccination trials against cryptosporidiosis carried out so far, including the active and passive immunisation approach, are also overviewed. It seems that with respect to a Cryptosporidium vaccine two target groups can be considered: children of the developing world and neonatal ruminants. Antigens representing possible candidates for a subunit vaccine were identified based on their function, location and/or the immune response they evoke. While the active vaccination of newborn calves, lambs and goat kids has to face a number of important limitations, the passive immunisation approach, where dams were immunised to protect their progeny by colostral transfer, was proven to be a valuable alternative. Finally, a number of points of action for the near future are put forward.","publish_time":"1999-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Graaf, Dirk C.; Spano, Furio; Petry, Franz; Sagodira, Serge; Bonnin, Alain","journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09a248034a8e29a2341c707ef66771cda8bd7b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130201.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002075199900082X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002075199900082X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine development","Cryptosporidium vaccine","subunit vaccine","passive immunisation approach","target antigens","cryptosporidiosis","active vaccination of newborn calves","target groups","possible candidates","possible targets","number of points","Vaccination trials","number of important limitations","lambs","children","goat kids","molecular biology","authors question","life cycle","developing world","action","parasite","paper","dams","neonatal ruminants","immunology studies","location","progeny","Developmental stages","near future","Abstract","feasibility","veterinary application","respect","immune response","colostral transfer","function","necessity","valuable alternative","consideration"],"language":"en"},

Rhinoscopically acquired nasal biopsies at this time revealed bilateral lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis. A tapering dose of oral prednisone caused the complete remission of the clinical signs, but 2 months after discontinuation of the therapy, the rhinitis recurred and the OD became exophthalmic. Computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass in both sides of the nasal cavity, both frontal sinuses, the right orbit, and to a lesser extent the left orbit. A fine needle aspirate of the right orbit revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and Aspergillus spp. hyphae. Repeat nasal biopsy demonstrated multi\u2010focal necrosis and a mixed inflammatory cell process which now included macrophages and scattered septate fungal hyphae. A few days later the cat became bilaterally blind and a contrast enhancing lesion involving the optic chiasm was found on magnetic resonance imaging. Despite a poor prognosis, therapy consisted of exenteration of the right orbit and trephination of both frontal sinuses before the planned initiation of medical antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, the cat died of cardiac arrest intraoperatively. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from both orbits at necropsy. Orbital aspergillosis has been rarely reported in cats and its relationship with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is unclear. In this patient lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis or previous antibiotic/corticosteroid therapy may have allowed secondary fungal invasion of the nasal mucosa and subsequently both orbits and the brain. Alternatively, Aspergillus infection may have preceded the lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis.","publish_time":"2009-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barachetti, Laura; Mortellaro, Carlo M.; Di Giancamillo, Mauro; Giudice, Chiara; Martino, Pieranna; Travetti, Olga; Miller, Paul E.","journal":"Vet Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7881c6e393df08e51ecffa5a85df95187acdc7a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169333.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2009.00695.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19392877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bilateral lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis","right orbit","patient lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis","nasal mucosa","nasal biopsies","nasal biopsy","nasal cavity","corticosteroid therapy","left orbit","bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge","frontal sinuses","orbits","Aspergillus infection","Aspergillus fumigatus","septate fungal hyphae","planned initiation of medical antifungal therapy","castrated male Persian cat","secondary fungal invasion","multi\u2010focal necrosis","mixed inflammatory cell process","macrophages","exenteration","previous antibiotic","time","optic chiasm","complete remission","soft tissue mass","pyogranulomatous inflammation","contrast","sides","month history of sneezing","trephination","clinical signs","lesser extent","tapering dose of oral prednisone","fine needle aspirate","Computed tomography","lesion","months","cats","relationship","discontinuation","magnetic resonance imaging","poor prognosis","Rhinoscopically","year\u2010old","cardiac arrest","days","OD","Orbital aspergillosis","necropsy","brain"],"language":"en"},

Currently used interventions have limitations yet the role of facemask in preventing those infections at MG has not been systematically reviewed. We have conducted a systematic review to synthesise evidence about the uptake and effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections in MGs. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using major electronic databases such as, Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL. Results Of 25 studies included, the pooled sample size was 12710 participants from 55 countries aged 11 to 89 years, 37% were female. The overall uptake of facemask ranged from 0.02% to 92.8% with an average of about 50%. Only 13 studies examined the effectiveness of facemask, and their pooled estimate revealed significant protectiveness against respiratory infections (relative risk [RR]=0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94, p \u003C0.01), but the study end points varied widely. Conclusion A modest proportion of attendees of MGs use facemask, the practice is more widespread among health care workers. Facemask use seems to be beneficial against certain respiratory infections at MGs but its effectiveness against specific infection remains unproven.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barasheed, Osamah; Alfelali, Mohammad; Mushta, Sami; Bokhary, Hamid; Alshehri, Jassir; Attar, Ammar A.; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c57a94225226db249a718e94fd6bbb4e2bb7e175.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110449.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.03.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310104; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of facemask","MGs","Facemask use","role of facemask","transmission of respiratory infections","certain respiratory infections","overall uptake of facemask","studies","systematic reviews","risk of acquisition","relative risk","pooled estimate","modest proportion of attendees","attendees of mass gatherings","pooled sample size","PRISMA","meta-analyses","significant protectiveness","Medline","guidelines","major electronic databases","preferred reporting items","practice","EMBASE","participants","limitations","specific infection","evidence","health care workers","Abstract Objectives","comprehensive literature search","Methods","countries","SCOPUS","CINAHL","used interventions","Conclusion","study end points","years","female","Results","average"],"language":"en"},

Results The rate of inconsistent radiographs was 2 of 265 cases (0.75%; 95% CI 0-1.8). A total of 246 children (92.8%) had simple radiographs, and 17 radiographs (6.9%) were complex. To identify 1 inconsistent and 1 complex radiograph requires imaging 133 and 15 children, respectively. Of 148 infants with oxygen saturation \u003E92% and a respiratory disease assessment score \u003C10 of 17 points, 143 (96.6%) had a simple radiograph, compared with 102 of 117 infants (87.2%) with higher scores or lower saturation (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3-14.3). Seven infants (2.6%) were identified for antibiotics pre-radiography; 39 infants (14.7%) received antibiotics post-radiography (95% CI, 8-16). Conclusions Infants with typical bronchiolitis do not need imaging because it is almost always consistent with bronchiolitis. Risk of airspace disease appears particularly low in children with saturation higher than 92% and mild to moderate distress.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schuh, Suzanne; Lalani, Amina; Allen, Upton; Manson, David; Babyn, Paul; Stephens, Derek; MacPhee, Shannon; Mokanski, Matthew; Khaikin, Svetlana; Dick, Paul","journal":"The Journal of Pediatrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81e6ba3933dfa9b47578dbd1503223e78f2bfb6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094743.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347607000078; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347607000078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complex bronchiolitis","simple bronchiolitis","typical bronchiolitis","children","simple radiographs","Conclusions Infants","proportion of radiographs inconsistent","rate of inconsistent radiographs","airway disease","typical presentation of bronchiolitis","CI","antibiotics post-radiography","antibiotics pre-radiography","saturation higher","inconsistent diagnoses","complex radiograph","Risk of airspace disease","lower saturation","oxygen saturation","imaging","respiratory disease assessment score","higher scores","Study design","prospective cohort study","pediatric emergency department","odds ratio","rates","months","antibiotic therapy","lobar consolidation","moderate distress","points","Objectives","cases","total"],"language":"en"},

The objective of our study was to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children \u003C6 years of age. METHODS: Stool samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from 260 children hospitalized for AGE (160 also had respiratory symptoms) and 157 otherwise healthy control children admitted for elective surgery were tested for the presence of four HCoVs using real time RT-PCR. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reg. NCT00987519). RESULTS: HCoVs were more frequent in patients with AGE than in controls (23/260, 8.8% versus 4/151, 2.6%; odds ratio, OR 3.3; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.3\u201310.0; P = 0.01). Three of four HCoV-positive members in the control group, asymptomatic when sampled, recalled gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms within the previous 14 days. In patients with AGE, HCoVs were present in NP samples more often than in stools (22/256, 8.6%, versus 6/260, 2.3%; P = 0.0004). In 5/6 children with HCoVs detected in stools, the viruses were also detected in NP swabs. Patients had a significantly higher probability of HCoV detection in stool (OR 4; 95% CI 1.4\u201315.3; P = 0.006) and also in stool and/or NP (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3\u201310.0; P = 0.01) than healthy controls. All four HCoVs species were detected in stool and NP samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with AGE than in the control group, high prevalence of HCoVs in NP swabs compounded by their low occurrence in stool samples and detection of other viruses in stool samples, indicate that HCoVs probably play only a minor role in causing gastrointestinal illness in children \u003C6 years old.","publish_time":"2013-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jev\u0161nik, Monika; Steyer, Andrej; Zrim, Tamara; Pokorn, Marko; Mrvi\u010D, Tatjana; Grosek, \u0160tefan; Strle, Franc; Lusa, Lara; Petrovec, Miroslav","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b263c0ae8e08257b2d46468d7561dbb7d7d6b6e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3610273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-46","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significance of HCoVs","HCoVs species","NP samples","Stool samples","NP swabs","high prevalence of HCoVs","years of age","patients","healthy control children","control group","gastrointestinal infections","respiratory symptoms","gastrointestinal illness","healthy controls","stools","well-known cause of respiratory infections","minor role","higher probability of HCoV detection","years old","HCoV-positive members","low occurrence","presence","elective surgery","etiology of acute gastroenteritis","real time RT-PCR","Human coronaviruses","days","BACKGROUND","METHODS","study","confidence interval","RESULTS","odds ratio","objective","CONCLUSIONS","NCT00987519"],"language":"en"},

MERS later spread to other countries in the Arabian Peninsula, followed by an outbreak in South Korea in 2015. At least 26 countries have reported MERS cases, and these numbers may increase over time. Due to international travel opportunities, all countries are at risk of imported cases of MERS, even if outbreaks do not spread globally. Therefore, it is essential for emergency department (ED) personnel to be able to rapidly assess MERS risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED and later adjusted for measles, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for use in initial detection and management of patients under investigation for MERS. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk factors, including travel to countries with current MERS transmission and contact with patients with confirmed MERS within 14 days, patients are risk stratified by type of exposure coupled with symptoms of fever and respiratory illness. If criteria are met, patients must be immediately placed into airborne infection isolation (or a private room until this type of isolation is available) and the emergency practitioner must alert the hospital infection prevention and control team and the local public health department. The 3I tool will facilitate rapid categorization and triggering of appropriate time-sensitive actions for patients presenting to the ED at risk for MERS.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koenig, Kristi L.","journal":"West J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8ae9d6178f8322e2f9b2453ef13bb312427bd15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4644025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587081/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2015.7.27915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS risk","MERS cases","confirmed MERS","MERS-CoV","risk of imported cases of MERS","management of patients","countries","current MERS transmission","tool","management of Ebola virus disease patients","initial detection","novel infectious disease","emerging infectious disease","emergency department","type of isolation","assessment of epidemiologic risk factors","airborne infection isolation","emergency practitioner","real-time use","appropriate time-sensitive actions","type of exposure","immediate actions","respiratory illness","hospital infection prevention","international travel opportunities","local public health department","Middle East respiratory syndrome","control team","contact","private room","coronavirus","days","symptoms of fever","rapid categorization","personnel","investigation","Arabian Peninsula","numbers","South Korea","Saudi Arabia","modification","measles","outbreaks","paper","criteria","Isolate"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing a yeast product in milk replacer (MR) on growth and health of calves, and on fecal populations of some targeted microorganisms related to calf health and growth (i.e., total bacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp.). We hypothesized that feeding a Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii (SCB) product would improve gastrointestinal health and growth performance of calves. Forty-two Holstein bull calves (42.6\u00B10.77kg at birth) were randomly assigned on day 2 of age to either a control or SCB treatment. The SCB was supplemented in MR and fed at 5g/d per head to supply 10 billion colony-forming units per day. All calves received high quality colostrum (\u003E50mg/mL of immunoglobulin G) during the first 24h of life, and were fed with 8L MR (150g/L mixed with 40\u00B0C water) daily from day 2\u201335, and 4L daily from day 35\u201342. Calves were also fed calf starter ad libitum from day 7\u201356. Daily MR and starter offered and refused, daily fecal scores, nasal scores, ear scores, and weekly body weight of calves were recorded. Fecal samples were collected on day 7, 35 and 56 after the first feeding of that day for microbial targets analysis. Overall, there is no serious disease challenge for all the calves during the entire experimental period. No differences were observed in MR intake, starter intake, metabolizable energy (ME) intake, average daily gain, ME intake to gain ratio, fecal score, nasal score, eye score or any targeted microorganisms between treatments throughout the experiment. These results suggest that supplementing SCB in MR has no additive effects on animal growth or fecal biomarkers of gut health when calves do not show deteriorated health status.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Z.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77\u20130.88 for R1 and 0.78\u20130.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC.

Routine clinical diagnostics for pneumonia etiology at government hospitals in Sarawak had historically involved only bacterial diagnostics. Viral diagnostics were only obtained through outside consultations. METHODS: From June 15, 2017 to May 14, 2018, we collected nasopharyngeal swabs from 600 patients of all ages older than 1 month hospitalized with pneumonia at Sibu and Kapit Hospitals. Specimens were examined at our collaborating institutions with a panel of molecular assays for viral pathogens including influenza A (IAV), IBV, ICV, and IDV, human adenovirus (AdV), human enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (CoV), respiratory syncytial virus subtype A (RSV-A) or RSV-B, and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20134. RESULTS: Of 599 samples examined, 288 (48%) had molecular evidence of 1 or more respiratory viruses. Overall, the most prevalent virus detected was RSV-A (14.2%) followed by AdV (10.4%) and IAV (10.4%), then RSV-B (6.2%), EV (4.2%), IBV (2.2%), PIV-3 (1.7%), CoV (1.0%), PIV-1 (1.0%), PIV-4 (0.7%), and PIV-2 (0.2%).

Abstract Respiratory infections include acute bronchitis, acute pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Each of these diseases has its own therapeutic approach, making important a good differential diagnosis. Acute bronchitis are very frequent, easy to diagnose and have a benign evolution. The etiology is usually viral. The treatment doesn\u2019t require antibiotics. Conversely, acute pneumonia is infrequent but has to be considered as a serious illness; it remains the sixth cause of death. In adults, pneumonia is usually due to bacteria and antibiotherapy is always required. Clinical diagnosis is based on presumption signs: fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, thoracic pain, localized rales and an overall feeling of severity. A chest X-ray is required. Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis can be due to bacteria, virus or a non infectious cause. Antibiotherapy indications are based on the probability of bacterial etiology (increased volume and purulence of sputum, apparition or increase of dyspnea) and on the severity of the chronic bronchitis (chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without respiratory insufficiency or chronic respiratory insufficiency).","publish_time":"2004-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benhamou, D","journal":"EMC - M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21888fed98056244eeaceef373dbf662aa14bf16.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1762419304000657; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1762419304000657","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Acute"],"organizations":["l\u0027adulte"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the chronic bronchitis","acute exacerbation","the severity","chronic bronchitis can be","chronic respiratory insufficiency","pneumonia is usually","the probability","acute pneumonia is infrequent but","The etiology is usually viral","Abstract Respiratory infections include acute bronchitis","to bacteria","insuffisance respiratoire chronique","bronchopathie chronique","exacerbations de bronchite chronique","pneumopathies aigu\u00EBs","bronchites aigu\u00EBs","antibioth\u00E9rapie","Clinical diagnosis is based","antibiotherapy is always required","origine bact\u00E9rienne","Antibiotherapy indications","it remains the sixth cause","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without respiratory insufficiency","chest X-ray is required","to be considered as","easy to diagnose","purulence","The treatment doesn\u2019t require antibiotics","apparition or increase","virus or","infectious cause","indications th\u00E9rapeutiques","\u00E9tiologie","sixi\u00E8me cause de mortalit\u00E9","increased volume","bacterial etiology","augmentation du volume","infections respiratoires","diagnostic facile","diagnostic clinique","r\u00E8gle virale","good differential diagnosis","serious illness","its own therapeutic approach","making important","localized rales","presumption signs","thoracic pain","tachypnea","fever","sputum","tachycardie","tachypn\u00E9e","these diseases","tachycardia","an overall feeling","entit\u00E9s","dyspnea","very frequent","simple","douleur thoracique","foyer","fi\u00E8vre","signes de pr\u00E9somption","death","Conversely","In adults","Each","probabilit\u00E9","risque \u00E9volutif","benign evolution","impression de gravit\u00E9","aggravation","\u00E9volution b\u00E9nigne","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","expectoration","r\u00E9alisation","radiographie pulmonaire","dyspn\u00E9e","adulte"],"language":"fr"},

It is interesting to identify the characteristic and potential role of 3\u0027 polyadenylation of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), which has been reported to contain two genomic RNAs with 3\u0027 poly(A) tails and caused severe disease on wheat in East Asia region. METHODS: 3\u0027 RACE was used to identify sequences of the 3\u2032 end in WYMV RNAs from naturally infected wheat by WYMV. In vitro translation assay was performed to analyze effect of UTRs of WYMV with or without 3\u2019polyadenylation on translation. In vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein were performed to evaluate effect of variable polyadenylation on replication. RESULTS: Variable polyadenylation in WYMV RNAs was identified via 3\u2032 RACE. WYMV RNAs in naturally infected wheat in China simultaneously present with regions of long, short, or no adenylation at the 3\u0027 ends. The effects of variable polyadenylation on translation and replication of WYMV RNAs were evaluated. 5\u2019UTR and 3\u2019UTR of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2 synergistically enhanced the translation of the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene in in vitro WGE system, whereas additional adenylates had an oppositive effect on this enhancement on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV. Additional adenylates remarkably inhibited the synthesis of complementary strand from viral genome RNA during the in vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein. CONCLUSIONS: 3\u0027 end of WYMV RNAs present variable polyadenylation even no polyadenylation. 3\u0027 polyadenylation have opposite effect on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2. 3\u0027 polyadenylation have negative effect on minus-strand synthesis of WYMV RNA in vitro. Variable polyadenylation of WYMV RNAs may provide sufficient selection on the template for translation and replication.

Previous studies suggest that the PEDV E protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process. However, the subcellular localization and other functions of PEDV E protein still require more research. METHODS: The subcellular localization and function of PEDV E protein were investigated by examining its effects on cell growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and cell survival. RESULTS: The results show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER, with small quantities localized in the nucleus. The PEDV E protein has no effect on the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) growth, cell cycle and cyclin A expression. The cells expressing PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV E protein induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated NF-\u03BAB which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and the nucleus and it can cause ER stress. The PEDV E protein had no effect on the IEC growth and cell cycle. In addition, the PEDV E protein is able to up-regulate IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression.","publish_time":"2013-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Honglei; Zhang, Qi; Dong, Jie; Liang, Yabing; Huang, Yong; Liu, Hung-Jen; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16a04dc7659daf72dfd1706f843b74d691048b6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3560205.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332027/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of PEDV E protein","functions of PEDV E protein","PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL","cell growth","expression","cell cycle progression","cell survival","ER stress","IEC growth","regulation of IL","subcellular localization","control cells","nucleus","Bcl","RESULTS","intestinal epithelial cells","important role","important pathogen","Previous studies","endoplasmic reticulum","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","swine","activated NF-\u03BAB","interleukin","effects","BACKGROUND","viral assembly process","cyclin","substantial economic losses","study","METHODS","small quantities","research","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Each viral pathogen has unique, frequently nuanced, aspects to its replication, which affects the host response and as a consequence the capacity of the virus to produce disease. There are, however, common features to the T cell response to viruses, which produce acute limited infection. This is true whether virus replication is restricted to a single site, for example, the respiratory tract (RT), CNS etc., or replication is in multiple sites throughout the body. In describing below the acute T cell response to virus infection, we employ acute virus infection of the RT as a convenient model to explore this process of virus infection and the host response. We divide the process into three phases: the induction (initiation) of the response, the expression of antiviral effector activity resulting in virus elimination, and the resolution of inflammation with restoration of tissue homeostasis.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Taeg S.; Sun, Jie; Legge, Kevin L.; Braciale, Thomas J.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bbc62d0c5e165ad41e3afafe2183b849331b352.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152034.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute virus infection","host response","virus replication","process of virus infection","acute T cell response","virus elimination","host immune response","acute limited infection","RT","viruses","expression of antiviral effector activity","example","resolution of inflammation","respiratory tract","CNS","single site","induction","convenient model","capacity","common features","consequence","restoration of tissue homeostasis","viral pathogen","phases","multiple sites","aspects","initiation","body","disease"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies confirmed a successful protection using homologous strains as live attenuated vaccines. In this study, a newly developed live attenuated IB-VAR2 vaccine representing the GI-23 Middle East IBV lineage was evaluated in day-old commercial broilers in an IBV-endemic area. A commercial broiler flock was vaccinated with the IB-VAR2 vaccine at day-old age followed by IB-H120 at day 16. The vaccinated flock was monitored on a weekly basis till the slaughter age. The health status and growth performance were monitored, and selected viral pathogen real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) detection was conducted on a weekly basis. Finally, the flock was compared to a nearby farm with only the classical IB-H120 vaccination program. Results showed that the IB-VAR2 vaccine was tolerable in day-old broiler chicks. The IBV virus rRT-PCR detection was limited to the trachea as compared to its nephropathogenic parent virus. Respiratory disease problems and high mortalities were reported in the IB-H120-only vaccinated flock. An exposure to a wild-type Egy/VarII strain was confirmed in both flocks as indicated by partial IBV S1 gene sequence. Even though the IB-VAR2-vaccinated flock performance was better than the flock that received only IB-H120, the IBV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and log2 Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody mean titers remained high (3128 \u00B1 2713 and \u22659 log2, respectively) until the 28th day of age.

Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a(\u2212/\u2212) mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UV-inactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacques, Alexandre; Bleau, Christian; Turbide, Claire; Beauchemin, Nicole; Lamontagne, Lucie","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94f51ff48ecab31eb34912aca2d4c0e99dc74182.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2753892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740307/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02946.x; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02946.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral fixation","TLR2","mice","specific viral receptors","viral interaction","viral replication","induction of IL","new viral PPRs","acute viral hepatitis","TNF-\u03B1 production","CEACAM1a","heparan sulphate receptors","High levels of IL","protein of MHV3","inflammatory responses","pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin","denatured S protein","specific receptor","mouse hepatitis virus","heparan sulfate","livers","pattern recognition receptors","activation of macrophages","nuclear factor","pathogenic MHV3","peritoneal macrophages","host cell","secretion of high","mouse strain","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","UV-inactivated virus","tumour necrosis factor","Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen","MAPK","coronavirus","\u03BAB","Toll","mechanisms responsible","spike","regions","rapid antiviral immune response","infected C57BL","study","results","histopathological observations","cells","objective"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS/METHODS: We collected 1\u20103 samples (n = 250 specimens) from 176 participants between October 2012 and January 17, 2013: participants with acute respiratory infection (ARI; cough and body aches or chills or fever/feverishness) and their social contacts. Virus was detected using RT\u2010PCR. RESULTS: 30.4% (76/250) of specimens tested positive for any virus tested, and 4.8% (12/250) were positive for 2 or more viruses. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs [22.0%; 55/250]), rhinovirus (7.6%; 19/250), and influenza A (6.4%; 16/250) were most prevalent. Symptoms changed significantly over time among ARI participants with HCoV: the prevalence of cough and chills decreased over 6 days (P = .04, and P = .01, respectively), while runny nose increased over the same period (P = .02).

We used reverse genetics to generate infectious clone viruses (icv) with an alanine substitution at nsp4 glycosylation site N176 or N237, or an asparagine to threonine substitution (nsp4-N258T), which is proposed to confer a temperature sensitive phenotype. We found that nsp4-N237A is lethal and nsp4-N258T generated a virus (designated Alb ts6 icv) that is temperature sensitive for viral replication. Analysis of Alb ts6 icv-infected cells revealed that there was a dramatic reduction in DMVs and that both nsp4 and nsp3 partially localized to mitochondria when cells were incubated at the non-permissive temperature.

These enveloped viruses have a genome made up of seven or eight RNA fragments. The different subtypes are determined by the nature of the two surface glycoproteins HA and NA. Seasonal flu is an epidemic wintertime illness occurring in temperate climate zones. Its epidemiology is linked to the great variability of the virus in time, necessitating an alert system that detects dominating circulating variants each year and that determines the vaccination composition. Clinical flu symptoms are not sufficiently specific to allow for diagnosis with virological tests. This is especially true during non-epidemic periods as well as in subjects older than 65 and younger than five. Children are especially vulnerable to influenza virus infections. Hospitalization occurs more frequently, the younger the child. In children younger than two years, the infection can be pauci-symptomatic and is sometimes detected from non-respiratory symptoms such as lethargy, convulsions, and dizziness. In all cases of respiratory syndrome compatible with influenza virus infection in hospitalized subjects, virological flu diagnosis is of utmost interest. Several tools are available to allow for direct viral detection in respiratory specimens: cell culture isolation, antigenic detection, RNA molecular detection.

METHODS: The data of the compensation board that covers HCWs of non-governmental healthcare providers in Germany was analysed for a five-year period. For hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, the period analysed was extended to the last 15 years. The annual rate of occupational infectious diseases (OIDs) per 100,000 employees was calculated. For needlestick injuries (NSI) a rate per 1,000 employees was calculated. RESULTS: Within the five years from 2005 to 2009 a total of 384 HCV infections were recognised as OIDs (1.5/100,000 employees). Active TB was the second most frequent cause of an OID. While the numbers of HBV and HCV infections decreased, the numbers for active TB did not follow a clear pattern. Needlestick injuries (NSIs) were reported especially often at hospitals (29.9/1,000 versus 7.4/1,000 employees for all other HCWs). CONCLUSION: Although they are declining, HCV infections remain frequent in HCWs, as do NSIs. Whether the reinforcement of the recommendations for the use of safety devices in Germany will prevent NSIs and therefore HCV infections should be closely observed.","publish_time":"2012-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nienhaus, Albert; Kesavachandran, Chandrasekharan; Wendeler, Dana; Haamann, Frank; Dulon, Madeleine","journal":"J Occup Med Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1952a38871ef31c0e837ff0ee666bd0350c8b32c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3474162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22553942/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6673-7-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","HCV","Active TB","HBV"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["HCV infections","employees","NSIs","Germany","OIDs","numbers of HBV","Active TB","needlestick injuries","years","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","HCWs of non-governmental healthcare providers","Healthcare workers","frequent cause","infectious agents","five-year period","annual rate of occupational infectious diseases","compensation board","use of safety devices","recommendations","order","data","INTRODUCTION","total","clear pattern","Disease surveillance","METHODS","reinforcement","prevention","RESULTS","hospitals","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings. They are essential in the management of the pandemic and should be taken in the early stages of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basile, Carlo; Combe, Christian; Pizzarelli, Francesco; Covic, Adrian; Davenport, Andrew; Kanbay, Mehmet; Kirmizis, Dimitrios; Schneditz, Daniel; van der Sande, Frank; Mitra, Sandip","journal":"Nephrol Dial Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ce9716f9cd0bf9907168b8f2fa0deb5906859de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196116/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Working Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","management of patients","Uraemic patients","European Dialysis","intensity of dialysis","Measures of prevention","novel coronavirus","haemodialysis centres","isolation","emerging COVID","control","disease","high morbidity","high incidence rates","healthcare systems","intrinsic fragility","frequent burden of comorbidities","EUDIAL","protection","screening","mitigation","containment","Group of ERA","major global human threat","present review","specific setting","exceptional additional strain","distribution","recommendations","specialized resources","staff","risk","requirements","personnel","EDTA","comorbid populations","similar settings","strict protocols","aim","early stages","area"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, this study aims to adapt the Fear of COVID-19 Scale into Turkish and investigate the relationships between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. Data were collected by convenience sampling method, which allowed us to reach total 1304 participants, aged between 18 and 64 years, from 75 cities in Turkey. In the adaptation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, convergent validity, and reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03B1, McDonald\u2019s \u03C9, Guttmann\u2019s \u03BB6, and composite reliability) analyses were performed. Additionally, the mediating role of psychological distress on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction was tested. The uni-dimensionality of the 7-item scale was confirmed on a Turkish sample. Item Response Theory revealed that all items were coherent and fit with the model. The results indicated that the Turkish version of the scale had satisfactory reliability coefficients. The fear of COVID-19 was found to be associated with psychological distress and life satisfaction. Results indicated that the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale had strong psychometric properties. This scale will allow mental health professionals to do research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Turkey.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Satici, Begum; Gocet-Tekin, Emine; Deniz, M.

A diagnostic bacterial load threshold based on inflammatory markers has been determined to differentiate infection from upper airway contamination in infants with cystic fibrosis, but not for children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), or bronchiectasis. METHODS: BAL samples from children undergoing bronchoscopy underwent quantitative bacterial culture, cytologic examination, and respiratory virus testing; a subset also had interleukin\u20108 examined. Geometric means (GMs) of total cell counts (TCCs) and neutrophil counts were plotted by respiratory pathogen bacterial load. Logistic regression determined associations between age, sex, Indigenous status, antibiotic exposure, virus detection and bacterial load, and elevated TCCs (\u003E400 \u00D7 10(3) cells/mL) and airway neutrophilia (neutrophils \u003E15% BAL leukocytes). RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, 655 children with PBB, CSLD, or bronchiectasis were enrolled. In univariate analyses, Indigenous status and bacterial load \u226510(5) colony\u2010forming units (CFU)/mL were positively associated with high TCCs. Viruses and bacterial load \u226510(4) CFU/mL were positively associated with neutrophilia; negative associations were seen for Indigenous status and macrolides. In children who had not received macrolide antibiotics, bacterial load was positively associated in multivariable analyses with high TCCs at \u226510(4) CFU/mL and with neutrophilia at \u226510(5) CFU/mL; GMs of TCCs and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated at 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/mL compared to negative cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a BAL threshold \u226510(4) CFU/mL to define lower airway infection in children with chronic endobronchial disorders.","publish_time":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hare, Kim M.; Pizzutto, Susan J.; Chang, Anne B.; Smith\u2010Vaughan, Heidi C.; McCallum, Gabrielle B.; Beissbarth, Jemima; Versteegh, Lesley; Grimwood, Keith","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdaedf24488485674a61a36ca04759ae0552d6d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167837.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29265639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","CFU","lower airway bacterial infection","respiratory pathogen bacterial load","diagnostic bacterial load threshold","airway neutrophilia","quantitative bacterial culture","protracted bacterial bronchitis","GMs of TCCs","high TCCs","elevated TCCs","lower airway infection","Indigenous status","BAL threshold","possible upper airway contamination","neutrophil counts","BAL samples","BAL leukocytes","chronic endobronchial disorders","PBB","CSLD","negative associations","bronchiectasis","respiratory virus testing","total cell counts","virus detection","multivariable analyses","univariate analyses","negative cultures","chronic suppurative lung disease","cytologic examination","antibiotic exposure","sex","bronchoscopy","infants","bronchoalveolar lavage","cystic fibrosis","inflammatory markers","subset","neutrophils","macrolide antibiotics","BACKGROUND","Logistic regression","Geometric means","guiding management","findings","METHODS","colony","interleukin","CONCLUSIONS","units","macrolides","cells","Viruses","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined \u201Cclass I\u201D glycoproteins adopt an \u03B1-helical \u201Ctrimer- of-hairpins\u201D conformation during the fusion pathway. Here we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric \u03B1-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola Virus (EBOV) and Marburg Virus (MARV) GP2, despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH-dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the \u03B1-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in EBOV and MARV GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate Virus (GGV) support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that despite being primarily arenavirus-like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koellhoffer, Jayne F.; Dai, Zhou; Malashkevich, Vladimir N.; Stenglein, Mark D.; Liu, Yanyun; Toro, Rafael; Harrison, Joseph; Chandran, Kartik; DeRisi, Joseph L.; Almo, Steven C.; Lai, Jonathan R.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fd162a7f923ef65e515d8f0a5e195b98583497c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c7bed5de7f3b0420a20453a9393ce3b50fffef6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3951589.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283613007511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333483/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283613007511; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3951589?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAS","CASV","Golden Gate Virus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stability of CASV GP2","CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation","transmembrane subunit of CASV","MARV GP2","predicted CASV GP2 core domain","CASV genome homology","post-fusion structure","pH-dependent stability","Marburg Virus","Ebola Virus","CAS virus","fusion pathway","trimeric \u03B1-helical bundle","envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit","higher stability","lower pH","EBOV","transmembrane subunits","despite","related Golden Gate Virus","crystal structure","Infection experiments","enveloped viruses","Denaturation studies","disease etiology","inclusion body disease","Corallus annulatus","step","GGV","host cell membranes","annulated tree boas","hairpins","mechanism of entry","acidic residues","conditions","network of interactions","protein constructs","endosomal acidification","class","arenaviruses","glycoproteins","results","chains","behavior","filoviruses","endosome"],"language":"en"},

These data will inform therapeutic development and phylogenetic analysis for this subset of HRV strains but should be viewed as one step in a long road leading to comprehensive HRV characterization.","publish_time":"2009-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arden, Katherine E; Mackay, Ian M","journal":"Genome Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f02b0d7567aa90c77c7fe13dc67f1bac185f88e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2684665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/gm44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19439028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classical strains","subset of HRV strains","serotyped HRV","Rhinovirus infections","novel strains","remaining classical HRV genome sequences","comprehensive HRV characterization","subgenomic sequences","undefined illnesses","infections costs billions of healthcare dollars","annual impact of human rhinovirus","phylogenetic analysis","flu","unknown patterns","long road","therapeutic development","virus-related wheezing exacerbations","otitis media","sinusitis","pneumonia","data","distinct species","step","date","genomes"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrate RlmM methyltransferase (MTase) activity on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA and its domain V. We have solved crystal structures of E. coli RlmM at 1.9 \u00C5 resolution and of an RlmM\u2013AdoMet complex at 2.6 \u00C5 resolution. RlmM consists of an N-terminal THUMP domain and a C-terminal catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domain in a novel arrangement. The catalytic domain of RlmM is closely related to YiiB, TlyA and fibrillarins, with the second K of the catalytic tetrad KDKE shifted by two residues at the C-terminal end of a beta strand compared with most 2\u2032O MTases. The AdoMet-binding site is open and shallow, suggesting that RNA substrate binding may be required to form a conformation needed for catalysis. A continuous surface of conserved positive charge indicates that RlmM uses one side of the two domains and the inter-domain linker to recognize its RNA substrate.","publish_time":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Punekar, Avinash S.; Shepherd, Tyson R.; Liljeruhm, Josefine; Forster, Anthony C.; Selmer, Maria","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ef096e83734058dd9385a5d65b0c63c080df563.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3488215.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KDKE","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic domain of RlmM","coli RlmM","RlmM methyltransferase","S rRNA","RlmM knockout strain","S ribosomal RNA","S subunits","fold MTase domain","N-terminal THUMP domain","S-adenosyl methionine","inter-domain linker","RNA substrate binding","C-terminal catalytic Rossmann","C-terminal end","AdoMet complex","AdoMet-binding site","\u00C5 resolution","catalytic tetrad KDKE","Escherichia coli","O MTases","O methylation of C2498","residues","activity","continuous surface of conserved positive charge","beta strand","novel arrangement","crystal structures of","domains","YiiB","YgdE","Previous experiments","TlyA","fibrillarins","conformation","catalysis"],"language":"en"},

Although PRRSV infection-induced cell apoptosis has been established, the related viral protein is still unknown. Here, we reported that PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) was a critical apoptosis inducer. Nsp4 could activate caspase-3, -8, and -9. Using truncated constructs without different domains in nsp4, we demonstrated that the full-length of nsp4 structure was required for its apoptosis-inducing activity. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the 3C-like serine protease activity of nsp4, we showed that nsp4-induced apoptosis was dependent on its serine protease activity. The ability of nsp4 to induce apoptosis was significantly impaired by His39, Asp64, and Ser118 mutations, suggesting that His39, Asp64, and Ser118 were essential for nsp4 to trigger apoptosis. In conclusion, our present work showed that PRRSV nsp4 could induce apoptosis in host cells and might be partially responsible for the apoptosis induced by PRRSV infection.

Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA plasmids encoding Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary proteins LJM17 and LJL143, when used to immunize dogs, resulted in a systemic and local Th1 cell-mediated immunity that interfered in parasite survival in vitro. Here we evaluated the ability of these same salivary antigens to induce anti-Leishmania immunity and to confer protection by immunizing dogs using a novel vaccination strategy more suitable for use in the field. The strategy consisted of a single dose of plasmid followed by two doses of recombinant Canarypoxvirus (rCanarypoxvirus) expressing L. longipalpis salivary proteins (LJM17 or LJL143). Thirty days after the final immunization, dogs were intradermally challenged with 10(7) Leishmania infantum promastigotes in the presence of L. longipalpis saliva. We followed the experimentally infected dogs for 10 months to characterize clinical, parasitological, and immunological parameters. Upon vaccination, all immunized dogs presented strong and specific humoral responses with increased serum concentrations of IFN-\u03B3, TNF, IL-7, and IL-15. The serum of dogs immunized with LJM17 also exhibited high levels of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-18. L. infantum infection was established in all experimental groups as evidenced by the presence of anti-Leishmania IgG, and by parasite detection in the spleen and skin. Dogs immunized with LJM17-based vaccines presented higher circulating levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, TNF, CXCL10, and GM-CSF post-infection when compared with controls. Results demonstrated that relevant Leishmania-specific immune responses were induced following vaccination of dogs with L. longipalpis salivary antigen LJM17 administered in a single priming dose of plasmid DNA, followed by two booster doses of recombinant Canarypox vector. Importantly, a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to be relevant for protection against leishmaniasis was evidenced after challenging LJM17-vaccinated dogs as compared to controls. Although similar results were observed following immunization with LJL143, the pro-inflammatory response observed after immunization was attenuated following infection. Collectively, these data suggest that the LJM17-based vaccine induced an immune profile consistent with the expected protective immunity against canine leishmaniosis. These results clearly support the need for further evaluation of the LJM17 antigen, using a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy against canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL).","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbehusen, Melissa Moura Costa; Cunha, Jurema; Suarez, Martha Sena; Teixeira, Clarissa; Almeida, Valter dos Anjos; Pereira, La\u00EDs da Silva; Bordoni, Marcelo; Gil-Santana, Leonardo; Solc\u00E0, Manuela da Silva; Fraga, Deborah Bittencourt Mot\u00E9; Fischer, Laurent; Bozza, Patricia Torres; Veras, Patricia Sampaio Tavares; Valenzuela, Jesus G.; Kamhawi, Shaden; Andrade, Bruno B.; Brodskyn, Claudia I.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaaaf1da07387bece9bfca99582b31ebe33b1fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6251279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519235/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Metacyclic Leishmania","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LJM17-vaccinated dogs","immunized dogs","serum of dogs","following vaccination of dogs","LJM17 antigen","immunizing dogs","infected dogs","longipalpis salivary antigen LJM17","high levels of IL","Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary proteins LJM17","LJM17-based vaccines","anti-Leishmania immunity","LJL143","Leishmania IgG","Leishmania infantum promastigotes","following infection","novel vaccination strategy","Metacyclic Leishmania promastigotes","relevant Leishmania-specific immune responses","salivary antigens","infantum infection","heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy","canine leishmaniosis","single dose of plasmid","protection","presence of","final immunization","TNF","controls","similar results","single priming dose of plasmid DNA","specific humoral responses","expected protective immunity","canine visceral leishmaniosis","pro-inflammatory cytokines","pro-inflammatory response","doses of recombinant Canarypoxvirus","DNA plasmids","increased serum concentrations of IFN","higher circulating levels of IFN","parasite detection","GM-CSF post-infection","parasite survival","host\u0027s skin","local Th1 cell-mediated immunity","booster doses of recombinant Canarypox vector","immune profile consistent","chemokines","rCanarypoxvirus","sand flies","parasites","use","CXCL10","significant increase","months","CVL","experimental groups","immunological parameters","Previous studies","spleen","evaluation","need","days","leishmaniasis","field","ability","data"],"language":"en"},

From drug administration to therapeutic activity, nanocarriers must evade the host\u0027s immune system, specifically and efficiently target and enter the cell, and release their payload into the cell cytoplasm by endosomal escape. These processes constitute the early infection stage of viruses. Viruses are a powerful natural nanomaterial for the efficient delivery of genetic information by sophisticated mechanisms. Over the past two decades, many virus-inspired nanocarriers have been generated to permit successful drug and gene delivery. In this review, we summarize the early infection machineries of viruses, of which the part has so far been utilized for delivery systems. Furthermore, we describe basics and applications of the bio-nanocapsule, which is a hepatitis B virus-mimicking nanoparticle harboring nearly all activities involved in the early infection machineries (i.e., stealth activity, targeting activity, cell entry activity, endosomal escaping activity).","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somiya, Masaharu; Liu, Qiushi; Kuroda, Shun\u0027ichi","journal":"Nanotheranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8b0ef630df7327adda9757e8cca4aaac3fe69b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5704007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29188175/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ntno.21723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic activity","stealth activity","cell entry activity","early infection machineries of viruses","endosomal escaping activity","gene delivery","early infection stage of viruses","delivery systems","use of nanocarriers","virus-inspired nanocarriers","cell cytoplasm","therapeutic effect","efficient delivery of genetic information","endosomal escape","successful drug","drug administration","adverse effect","hepatitis B virus","host\u0027s immune system","powerful natural nanomaterial","genes","drugs","sophisticated mechanisms","nanoparticle","decades","activities","payload","bio-nanocapsule","applications","processes","basics","Nanomedicines","review"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, the properties of the DMFE have been carefully described for some microorganisms. In most cases, however, this information has been obtained only for a single environment, and very few studies have explored the effect that environmental variation may have on the DMFE. Environmental effects are particularly relevant for the evolution of multi-host parasites and thus for the emergence of new pathogens. Here we characterize the DMFE for a collection of twenty single-nucleotide substitution mutants of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) across a set of eight host environments. Five of these host species were naturally infected by TEV, all belonging to family Solanaceae, whereas the other three were partially susceptible hosts belonging to three other plant families. First, we found a significant virus genotype-by-host species interaction, which was sustained by differences in genetic variance for fitness and the pleiotropic effect of mutations among hosts. Second, we found that the DMFEs were markedly different between Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae hosts. Exposure of TEV genotypes to non-Solanaceae hosts led to a large reduction of mean viral fitness, while the variance remained constant and skewness increased towards the right tail. Within the Solanaceae hosts, the distribution contained an excess of deleterious mutations, whereas for the non-Solanaceae the fraction of beneficial mutations was significantly larger. All together, this result suggests that TEV may easily broaden its host range and improve fitness in new hosts, and that knowledge about the DMFE in the natural host does not allow for making predictions about its properties in an alternative host.","publish_time":"2011-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lali\u0107, Jasna; Cuevas, Jos\u00E9 M.; Elena, Santiago F.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7cf054fd2a9f9366458e8c251a37bda87fca328.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219607.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125497/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMFE","TEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-Solanaceae hosts","new hosts","host range","alternative host","natural host","host environments","family Solanaceae","susceptible hosts","host species interaction","evolution of multi-host parasites","distribution of mutational fitness effects","pleiotropic effect of mutations","Exposure of TEV genotypes","Environmental effects","Knowledge","properties","fraction of beneficial mutations","excess of deleterious mutations","large reduction of mean viral fitness","genetic variance","single environment","environmental variation","emergence of new pathogens","single-nucleotide substitution mutants of Tobacco","potyvirus","skewness","studies","differences","significant virus genotype","collection","set","predictions","right tail","evolutionary models","recent years","plant families","DMFEs","cases","information","result","microorganisms"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected. Consequently, the results of this study also indicate that neofunctionalism, which has been developed for western political systems, needs to be re-examined when applied to the unique, dynamic, and complex political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Minho","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf67bea57ff8d8636ff70ce87524818187e4b90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287720/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2006.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517706000744; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517706000744","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Peace Index"],"locations":["South Korea","Mt.

Deconjugation of Ub or UBL from proteins is performed by a class of proteases called isopeptidases. Herein is described a readily quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform consisting of Ub or UBL fused to the reporter enzyme phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). Isopeptidase activity releases PLA(2), which cleaves its substrate, generating a signal that is linear with deubiquitylase (DUB) concentration and is able to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deNEDDylase, and deISGylase activities. The power and sensitivity of the UBL-PLA(2) assay are demonstrated by its ability to differentiate the contrasting deISGylase and DUB activities of two coronavirus proteases: severe acute respiratory syndrome papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) and NL63 CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). Furthermore, direct comparisons with the current Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) assay demonstrated that the Ub-PLA(2) assay is an effective tool for characterizing modulators of isopeptidase activity. This observation was expanded by profiling the inhibitory activity of the nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor NSC 632839 against DUBs and deSUMOylases. Taken together, these studies illustrate the utility of the reporter-based approach to measuring isopeptidase activity.","publish_time":"2008-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholson, Benjamin; Leach, Craig A.; Goldenberg, Seth J.; Francis, Dana M.; Kodrasov, Matthew P.; Tian, Xufan; Shanks, John; Sterner, David E.; Bernal, Alejandro; Mattern, Michael R.; Wilkinson, Keith D.; Butt, Tauseef R.","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a61e5889417eb9962a005eadfba3c9d28e73a9af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2386736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18424514/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2386736?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1110/ps.083450408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UBL","NSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ub-PLA","Isopeptidase activity releases PLA","current Ub","Ub-AMC","UBL-PLA","characterizing modulators of isopeptidase activity","inhibitory activity","cellular proteins","DUB activities","critical proteins","quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform","nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor NSC","deISGylase activities","deconjugation of ubiquitin","NL63 CoV papain","coronavirus proteases","cellular physiology","class of proteases","contrasting deISGylase","SARS-CoV PLpro","reporter-based approach","reporter enzyme phospholipase","severe acute respiratory syndrome papain","universal means","effective tool","DUBs","concentration","utility","deubiquitylase","localization","lifetime","deNEDDylase","methylcoumarin","UBLs","signal","deSUMOylases","direct comparisons","ability","sensitivity","isopeptidases","studies","power","PLP2","substrate","observation"],"language":"en"},

Paradoxically, the ligation of monocyte or macrophage Fc\u03B3 receptors by IgG immune complexes, rather than aiding host defences, can suppress innate immunity, increase production of interleukin 10, and bias T-helper-1 (Th1) responses to Th2 responses, leading to increased infectious output by infected cells. This intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection modulates the severity of diseases as disparate as dengue haemorrhagic fever and leishmaniasis. Intrinsic ADE is distinct from extrinsic ADE, whereby complexes of infectious agents with non-neutralising antibodies lead to an increased number of infected cells. Intrinsic ADE might be involved in many protozoan, bacterial, and viral infections.

RESULTS: Details of 1,094 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, including 421 related deaths. Significant differences were observed in the presentation of the disease from year to year, and all studied parameters differed during the years under study (all P-values \u003C0.05). Evaluation of the effects of various potential risk factors of the final outcome (dead/survived) revealed that two factors, namely, the morbid case being native and travel history, are significant based on a unifactorial analysis (P \u003C0.05). From 2013 to 2016, these factors remained important. However, factors that were significant in predicting mortality varied in different years.

The swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years and for many, their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak. This study examines public understandings of the pandemic, exploring how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit seventy three people (61 women and 12 men) to take part in 14 focus group discussions around the time of the second wave in swine flu cases. RESULTS: These discussions showed that there was little evidence of the public over-reacting, that people believed the threat of contracting swine flu was inevitable, and that they assessed their own self-efficacy for protecting against it to be low. Respondents assessed a greater risk to their health from the vaccine than from the disease. Such findings could have led to apathy about following the UK Governments recommended health protective behaviours, and a sub-optimal level of vaccine uptake. More generally, people were confused about the difference between seasonal influenza and swine flu and their vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests a gap in public understandings which could hinder attempts to communicate about novel flu viruses in the future. There was general support for the government\u0027s handling of the pandemic, although its public awareness campaign was deemed ineffectual as few people changed their current hand hygiene practices. There was less support for the media who were deemed to have over-reported the swine flu pandemic.","publish_time":"2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Shona; Smith, Emily","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/621c17ebf69617fe8e330f6c9818880902ee6a97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2998491.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21078169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["swine flu pandemic","swine flu cases","swine flu outbreak","people","threat of contracting swine flu","novel flu viruses","public understandings","cases of influenza","public over-reacting","seasonal influenza","public awareness campaign","major influenza outbreak","UK Governments","novel virus","general support","health protective behaviours","focus group discussions","sub-optimal level of vaccine uptake","time","little evidence","attempts","difference","current hand hygiene practices","research","gap","government\u0027s handling","wave","H1N1","greater risk","apathy","encounter","Mexico","future","study","vaccines","METHODS","Purposive sampling","Respondents","CONCLUSIONS","media","women","BACKGROUND","self-efficacy","findings","RESULTS","disease","years","risks"],"language":"en"},

The entry of enveloped viruses into cells requires the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, driven by conformational changes in viral glycoproteins. Structural studies have defined three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. Despite their different structural organizations, all seem to have a common mechanism of action that generates the same lipid organizations during the fusion pathway. The entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires binding of the virus to one or more receptors present at the cell surface, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. These steps are mediated by virally encoded glycoproteins that promote both receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The first crystal structure of a viral fusion protein ectodomain that has been determined is that of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) in its prefusion conformation. The structures of viral fusion glycoproteins, of which the conformational change is triggered at low pH, has allowed the identification of amino acid residues that play the role of pH-sensitive molecular switches.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albertini, Aur\u00E9lie; Bressanelli, St\u00E9phane; Lepault, Jean; Gaudin, Yves","journal":"Current Topics in Membranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78d2326c0db311a468afc7898394d297846ff8b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173507.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858917000039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123858917000039; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-385891-7.00003-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion of viral","viral fusion machinery","viral glycoproteins","structures of viral fusion glycoproteins","fusion pathway","viral fusion protein ectodomain","classes of viral membrane fusion proteins","viral envelope","entry of enveloped viruses","encoded glycoproteins","different structural organizations","host cells","role of pH","crystal structure","conformational changes","low pH","cellular membranes","lipid organizations","Structural studies","influenza virus hemagglutinin","binding","receptor recognition","identification of amino acid residues","receptors present","sensitive molecular switches","cell surface","Publisher Summary","chapter","common mechanism of action","prefusion conformation","steps"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies in mice have suggested that memory T cells that accumulate in tissues, termed tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells, play a crucial role in maintaining long-term protective immunity to mucosal pathogens. CD4 and CD8 T(RM) cells can be induced following infection at mucosal sites or the skin, where they are maintained and poised to respond rapidly to reinfection with the same pathogen. T(RM) cells can also be generated by vaccination, but their induction is influenced by a number of factors, including the type of vaccine, the adjuvant, and the route of immunization. Live attenuated vaccines appear to be more effective than killed or subunit vaccines at inducing T(RM) cells and mucosal immunization, especially by intranasal route, is more effective than parenteral delivery. However, evidence is emerging that formulation of killed or subunit vaccines with novel adjuvants, especially those that generate Th1 and Th17 responses, can promote the induction of T(RM) cells. While T(RM) cells are also present at high number in mucosal tissues in humans, one of the challenge will be to develop methodologies for routine quantification of these cells in humans. Nevertheless, the identification of approaches for optimum induction of T(RM) cells in mice should assist in the design of more effective vaccines that sustain protective immunity against a range of human pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilk, Mieszko M.; Mills, Kingston H.

Recently, a pig producer in The Netherlands who routinely used toltrazuril complained about diarrhea in suckling piglets in the absence of bacterial and viral pathogens, and oocysts of C. suis could be isolated from feces of affected litters. METHODS: Piglets from two litters were infected with a field isolate of C. suis, Holland-I, and treated with 0 (Holl-Ctrl), 20 (Holl-20) or 30 (Holl-30) mg/kg of body weight (BW) of toltrazuril (Baycox\u00AE). The efficacy of toltrazuril was measured by assessment of oocyst excretion, fecal consistency and BW gain. A separate litter was infected with a toltrazuril-susceptible strain of C. suis, Wien-I, and treated with 0 (Wien-Ctrl) or 20 (Wien-20) mg/kg BW of toltrazuril for comparison. RESULTS: Treatment with the recommended (20 mg/kg) dose of toltrazuril completely suppressed oocyst shedding and diarrhea in group Wien-20. The prevalence of oocyst excretion was 100% in the groups infected with Holland-I and 80% in the group Wien-Ctrl. Most days with diarrhea were observed in group Holl-20 with an average of 6.40%, followed by 5.71% in Wien-Ctrl, while in Holl-Ctrl and Holl-30 diarrhea was only seen in 1.79% of the samples (n = 14/piglet). Oocyst excretion, fecal consistency and BW gain did not differ significantly among groups infected with Holland-I, indicating loss of efficacy to toltrazuril. CONCLUSION: Experimental infections and treatment confirmed toltrazuril resistance against the field isolate even at increased dosage.

In the absence of a standardized protocol for resistance testing in C. suis, regular parasitological examination and, if possible, experimental confirmation should be considered to evaluate the extent and consequences of toltrazuril resistance.

A written pandemic emergency plan and establishment of emergency management teams are critical to mounting a coordinated and effective response to what will be a catastrophic event. Members of these teams should include public health, medical, emergency response and public safety officials, organized at each local, state and federal level. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have substantially increased funding and support for bioterrorism planning in the United States. Thus, public health officials have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen current systems\u0027 planning efforts by promoting dual use bioterrorism/pandemic influenza plans. Combining lessons learned from the 2001 terrorist incidents, recent preevent smallpox vaccine programs and the history of past influenza pandemics, more effective strategies can be developed. For example, enhanced influenza surveillance systems can provide data that will not only provide early identification of a novel influenza strain, but will provide more timely recognition of other outbreaks of infectious diseases, including public health threats that may initially present as an influenza-like illness (ILI). In recent years, we have witnessed emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats that have presented us with challenges similar to those posed by an influenza pandemic. Such events highlight the need for advance planning to ensure an optimal response to a health emergency that is certain to be unpredictable, complex, rapidly evolving and accompanied by considerable public alarm. While advance warning for a terrorist attack is unlikely, the warning already exists for a possible new influenza strain, as evidenced by the recent cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong and the rapid global spread of cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gensheimer, K.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors\u2014which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines\u2014induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloom, David C.; Tran, Robert K.; Feller, Joyce; Voellmy, Richard","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbaaee7a5ac9ab3324e82bc7b8706edc5bd1524e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6069180.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00616-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["limited virus replication","efficient pathogen replication","Replication-competent controlled virus vectors","vigorous replication","Single activation of viral replication","time-limited replication","unactivated vectors","context of efficient transient vector replication","replication-essential genes","Unactivated viral vectors","wild-type virus challenge","mice of efficient","replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector","equine influenza virus hemagglutinin","localized activation","protective immune responses","balanced immune response","specific cellular immune responses","efficient vaccination","virulent herpes simplex virus","hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response","Immunization of mice","absence of activation","recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus","site of administration","wild-type strain","HSV","detectable protection","stringent control","gene switch","administration region","immunogenicity","transient heat treatment","expressed heterologous antigen","neutralizing antibody","localized application","conventional vaccines","uncompromised safety","complete protection","necessary safety","equivalents of inactivated vaccines","presence of systemic antiprogestin results","mouse footpad lethal challenge model","prevention","lethality","rear footpads","mitigation of infectious diseases","severalfold enhancement","novel agents worth","infected cells","inactivation","efficacy","syn","attenuation","immunocompromised patients","pathology","above-mentioned hypothesis","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Q\u03B2) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Q\u03B2, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somovilla, Pilar; Manrubia, Susanna; L\u00E1zaro, Ester","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631425.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216651/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8020080","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate of change","rate of temperature change","populations","adaptive mutations","sudden temperature change gain fitness","different patterns of change","RNA bacteriophage","fitness variations","bacteriophage Q\u03B2","fitness values","rapidity of adaptation","dynamics of adaptation","particular selected mutations","adaptive pathways","standing genetic diversity","high genetic diversity","abrupt environmental changes","followed evolutionary pathways","RNA viruses","evolutionary process","new conditions","population size","stress conditions","gradual changes","correspondences","order","beneficial effects","great importance","lineages","optimum","temperatures higher","consensus sequences","selective pressures","main factors","likelihood","systems","life-history","reduction","conclusion","work","results"],"language":"en"},

The cat was thin, cachectic and paraplegic on presentation. The survey radiographs showed a left caudal pulmonary lesion and lytic skeletal lesions at the right iliac crest and left distal scapula. Due to a poor prognosis for complete recovery, the owner opted for euthanasia. Post-mortem examination revealed bilaterally small and irregular kidneys, lysis of the left iliac crest and left distal scapula and a dilated left ventricular lumen with a thin interventricular septum.

METHODS: Nasal samples were collected in coastal Kenya through community-based and hospital-based surveillance. HCoV-NL63 was detected with multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR, and positive samples were targeted for nucleotide sequencing of the spike (S) protein. Additionally, paired samples from 25 individuals with evidence of repeat HCoV-NL63 infection were selected for whole-genome virus sequencing. RESULTS: HCoV-NL63 was detected in 1.3% (75/5573) of child pneumonia admissions. Two HCoV-NL63 genotypes circulated in Kilifi between 2008 and 2014. Full genome sequences formed a monophyletic clade closely related to contemporary HCoV-NL63 from other global locations. An unexpected pattern of repeat infections was observed with some individuals showing higher viral titers during their second infection. Similar patterns for 2 other endemic coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were observed. Repeat infections by HCoV-NL63 were not accompanied by detectable genotype switching. CONCLUSIONS: In this coastal Kenya setting, HCoV-NL63 exhibited low prevalence in hospital pediatric pneumonia admissions. Clade persistence with low genetic diversity suggest limited immune selection, and absence of detectable clade switching in reinfections indicates initial exposure was insufficient to elicit a protective immune response.","publish_time":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiyuka, Patience K; Agoti, Charles N; Munywoki, Patrick K; Njeru, Regina; Bett, Anne; Otieno, James R; Otieno, Grieven P; Kamau, Everlyn; Clark, Taane G; van der Hoek, Lia; Kellam, Paul; Nokes, D James; Cotten, Matthew","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b420869104820f327acb9db991fb1fe7ec281b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6037089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29741740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["contemporary HCoV-NL63","HCoV-NL63 genotypes","HCoV-OC43","evidence of repeat HCoV-NL63 infection","Human coronavirus NL63","reinfections","positive samples","Clade persistence","monophyletic clade","individuals","absence of detectable clade","Nasal samples","paired samples","unexpected pattern of repeat infections","hospital pediatric pneumonia admissions","coastal Kenya setting","child pneumonia admissions","genome virus sequencing","hospital-based surveillance","low prevalence","endemic pathogen","severe respiratory tract infections","endemic coronaviruses","nucleotide sequencing","detectable genotype","genome sequences","low genetic diversity","limited immune selection","protective immune response","multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR","initial exposure","spike","higher viral titers","community","BACKGROUND","global locations","Similar patterns","CONCLUSIONS","Kilifi","protein","METHODS","RESULTS","lifetime"],"language":"en"},

Seven residues on the dimer interface were selected for evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods. These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the \u03B1-helix A\u2032 of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II. We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer\u2013dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability.

The C-type lectin, DC-SIGN efficiently binds and transmits HIV-1 to susceptible cell in trans thereby augmenting the infection. A potential association of the DC-SIGN neck domain repeats polymorphism and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. Methods Genetic risk association study was conducted in HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES; n =50) individuals, HIV-1 seronegative (HSN; n =314) healthy control and HIV-1 infected seropositive patients (HSP; n =190) for polymorphism in neck domain of DC-SIGN gene. The DC-SIGN genotypes were identified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed by sequencing. Fisher exact or \u03C72 test was used for statistical analysis. Results One HSN and HSP individual who were heterozygous (7/8) with respect to DC-SIGN repeat regions were found. The DC-SIGN neck repeat polymorphism among North Indian individuals was not associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, inheritance study of heterozygous mutation (7/8) in HSN individual\u0027s family showed that one parent, two brothers, one sister and one daughter were heterozygous (7/8) for DC-SIGN mutant allele. Sequence analyses of DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region of randomly selected 25 North Indian individuals from HSP, HSN and HES revealed four conserved intronic mutations. These mutations were at nucleotide position 1283, 1306, 1308 upstream and 1906 downstream of the DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region when compared with the wild type sequence (NCBI Acc. No. AF209479). Conclusion The polymorphism in DC-SIGN neck repeats region was rare and not associated with HIV-1 susceptibility among North Indians. Sequencing analysis of DC-SIGN gene confirmed four novel genetic variants in intronic region flanking exon 4 coding region.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rathore, Anurag; Chatterjee, Animesh; Sood, Vikas; Khan, Sohrab Z.; Banerjea, Akhil C.; Yamamoto, Naohiko; Dhole, Tapan N.","journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff1dcf0a1deb1d323bd0b6a71f496d7a8a9c97f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124224.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2007.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18255039/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898108000120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898108000120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["HES","NCBI Acc"],"locations":["North"],"keyphrases":["DC-SIGN exon","DC-SIGN genotypes","SIGN gene","DC-SIGN repeat regions","DC-SIGN neck repeats region","DC-SIGN mutant allele","DC-SIGN neck domain repeats polymorphism","neck domain of DC","risk of HIV","Sequencing analysis of DC","Sequence analyses of DC","intronic region","coding region","infection","North Indian individuals","HES","CCR5 gene","genetic factors","Methods Genetic risk association study","HSN individual\u0027s family","HSP individual","North Indians","inheritance study of heterozygous mutation","susceptibility","novel genetic variants","wild type sequence","conserved intronic mutations","potential association","statistical analysis","C-type lectin","infected seropositive patients","\u03C72 test","parent","PCR","homozygosity","healthy control","respect","DNA","peripheral blood","sister","NCBI","CCR5\u0394","susceptible cell","brothers","Fisher exact","nucleotide position","trans","daughter","Abstract Background","AF209479","Results","resistance","Conclusion","debate"],"language":"en"},

Amongst other limitations of current anti-HBV treatment, failure to eliminate the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and emergence of resistance remain the most worrisome. Viral rebound from latent episomal cccDNA reservoirs occurs following cessation of therapy, patient non-compliance, or the development of escape mutants. Simultaneous viral co-infections, such as by HIV-1, further complicate therapeutic interventions. These challenges have prompted development of novel targeted hepatitis B therapies. Given the ease with which highly specific and potent nucleic acid therapeutics can be rationally designed, gene therapy has generated interest for antiviral application. Gene therapy strategies developed for HBV include gene silencing by harnessing RNA interference, transcriptional inhibition through epigenetic modification of target DNA, genome editing by designer nucleases, and immune modulation with cytokines. DNA-binding domains and effectors based on the zinc finger (ZF), transcription activator-like effector (TALE), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems are remarkably well suited to targeting episomal cccDNA. This review discusses recent developments and challenges facing the field of anti-HBV gene therapy, its potential curative significance and the progress towards clinical application.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloom, Kristie; Maepa, Mohube Betty; Ely, Abdullah; Arbuthnot, Patrick","journal":"Genes (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b46170b59d879a53ec59e8a24a0c01b16df08e3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5924549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649127/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes9040207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of anti-HBV gene therapy","Gene therapy strategies","gene silencing","following cessation of therapy","Viral rebound","challenges","limitations of current anti-HBV treatment","latent episomal cccDNA reservoirs","hepatitis B virus","closed circular DNA","DNA-binding domains","epigenetic modification of target DNA","development of novel targeted hepatitis B therapies","Simultaneous viral co-infections","clinical application","antiviral application","development of escape mutants","transcriptional inhibition","harnessing RNA interference","potential curative significance","CRISPR","interspaced short palindromic repeat","designer nucleases","genome","failure","transcription activator","patient non-compliance","zinc finger","TALE","systems","progress","effectors","potent nucleic acid therapeutics","global health concern","accounts","immune modulation","ZF","recent developments","Chronic infection","emergence of resistance","HIV","cytokines","review","therapeutic interventions","deaths"],"language":"en"},

However, although a protein product has been identified from the 3c open reading frame, to date the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been established. We present nucleotide sequence data suggesting that each of the three open reading frames is conserved in a variety of different IBV strains and further show, through the preparation of monospecific antisera against bacterial fusion proteins, that IBV-infected cells contain small amounts of the products of these ORFs. In vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c open reading frames suggest strongly that all three proteins can be translated from a single molecular species, and expression studies carried out in intact cells support this conclusion.

However, the likelihood that amyloidosis would actually occur under physiological conditions depends largely on the amino acid composition of a protein. We explore using a naive Bayesian classifier and a weighted decision tree for predicting the amyloidogenicity of immunoglobulin sequences. RESULTS: The average accuracy based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation of a Bayesian classifier generated from 143 amyloidogenic sequences is 60.84%. This is consistent with the average accuracy of 61.15% for a holdout test set comprised of 103 AM and 28 non-amyloidogenic sequences. The LOO cross validation accuracy increases to 81.08% when the training set is augmented by the holdout test set. In comparison, the average classification accuracy for the holdout test set obtained using a decision tree is 78.64%. Non-amyloidogenic sequences are predicted with average LOO cross validation accuracies between 74.05% and 77.24% using the Bayesian classifier, depending on the training set size. The accuracy for the holdout test set was 89%. For the decision tree, the non-amyloidogenic prediction accuracy is 75.00%. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study indicates that both classification methods may be promising in providing straightforward predictions on the amyloidogenicity of a sequence. Nevertheless, the number of available sequences that satisfy the premises of this study are limited, and are consequently smaller than the ideal training set size. Increasing the size of the training set clearly increases the accuracy, and the expansion of the training set to include not only more derivatives, but more alignments, would make the method more sound. The accuracy of the classifiers may also be improved when additional factors, such as structural and physico-chemical data, are considered. The development of this type of classifier has significant applications in evaluating engineered antibodies, and may be adapted for evaluating engineered proteins in general.","publish_time":"2010-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"David, Maria Pamela C; Concepcion, Gisela P; Padlan, Eduardo A","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e086d4275f9420065465a39f78c29bd36a5796d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3098112.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average accuracy","holdout test set","average classification accuracy","ideal training set size","LOO cross validation accuracy","non-amyloidogenic prediction accuracy","non-amyloidogenic sequences","average LOO cross validation accuracies","naive Bayesian classifier","amyloidogenicity of immunoglobulin sequences","number of available sequences","type of classifier","weighted decision tree","classification methods","engineered antibodies","exploratory study","engineered proteins","number of degenerative disorders","significant applications","potential","amino acid composition","polypeptide backbones","physiological conditions","physico-chemical data","amyloidosis","additional factors","straightforward predictions","premises","comparison","leave","expansion","amyloid fibrils","alignments","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","development","classifiers","derivatives","RESULTS","sound","likelihood"],"language":"en"},

Access to social media in low- and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances. Despite this growth, the use of social media in low- and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries. Objective To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low- and middle-income countries. Methods A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017. Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middle-income country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health. Content analysis was performed to identify themes. Results Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports. Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n = 15) and African (n = 12) countries. Twitter (n = 11) and Facebook (n = 10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms. Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users\u2019 expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations). Most studies addressed more than one theme. Conclusion Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration amongst health providers in low- and middle-income countries. Misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers, as well as hysteria and chaos. Organizations using social media should provide accurate and readable information. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. This is a nascent body of literature and future research should investigate the relative effectiveness of various platforms for different users, other potential uses, and pursue a broader geographical focus.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagg, Emily; Dahinten, V.

Data on 94683 international travelers who visited 113529 international destinations attended at the IVC of Malaga (Spain) during 2000\u20132017 were studied. A descriptive and time series analyses was conducted. The demand to IVC was 3.47 times higher in 2017 than in 2000. The increase has not been the same for all destinations: Travel to South-East Asia and Western Pacific World Health Organization (WHO) regions has multiplied by 10, while in the same period, Africa WHO region has declined from 36% to 20% of total demand. Thailand, India and Brazil were the countries with the highest demand (21% of all pre-travel consultations). We found out three periods, concurrent with some socioeconomic or health events, in which the number of travellers attend decline with respect to the previous years, or the growth was very slow. Growth in the demand for pre-travel medical advice in parallel with a foreseeable increase in the number of travelers is expected. Pre-travel medical services must be adapted to this increase.

Here, we investigate the susceptible-infected epidemic process evolving on hierarchical networks in which agents randomly walk along the edges and establish contacts in network nodes. We employ a metapopulation modeling framework that allows us to explore the contagion spread patterns in relation to multi-scale mobility behaviors. A series of computer simulations revealed that a shifted power-law-like negative relationship between the peak timing of epidemics \u03C4 0 and population density, and a logarithmic positive relationship between \u03C4 0 and the network size, can both be explained by the gradual enlargement of fluctuations in the spreading process. We employ a semi-analytical method to better understand the nature of these relationships and the role of pertinent demographic factors. Additionally, we provide a quantitative discussion of the efficiency of a border screening procedure in delaying epidemic outbreaks on hierarchical networks, yielding a rather limited feasibility of this mitigation strategy but also its non-trivial dependence on population density, infector detectability, and the diversity of the susceptible region. Our results suggest that the interplay between the human spatial dynamics, network topology, and demographic factors can have important consequences for the global spreading and control of infectious diseases. These findings provide novel insights into the combined effects of human mobility and the organization of geographical networks on spreading processes, with important implications for both epidemiological research and health policy.","publish_time":"2014-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xiao-Pu; Zhao, Zhi-Dan; Hadzibeganovic, Tarik; Wang, Bing-Hong","journal":"Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3bf49a9ff91d2428ce8f220a12dc6e8d7eaeff6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129035.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2013.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288419/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570413003882; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570413003882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hierarchical networks","spreading process","organization of geographical networks","Abstract Hierarchical geographical traffic networks","population density","human trajectories","network topology","global spreading","network nodes","network size","combined effects of human mobility","susceptible-infected epidemic process","human spatial dynamics","negative relationship","epidemic outbreaks","important consequences","important implications","role of pertinent demographic factors","susceptible region","logarithmic positive relationship","peak timing of epidemics \u03C4","multi-scale mobility behaviors","non-trivial dependence","border screening procedure","understanding of scaling laws","mitigation strategy","infector detectability","efficiency","shifted power-law","epidemiological research","patterns","processes","novel insights","limited feasibility","control of infectious diseases","nature","diversity","relationships","edges","interplay","gradual enlargement of fluctuations","health policy","series of computer simulations","findings","contagion","contacts","agents","semi-analytical method","quantitative discussion","metapopulation modeling framework","results"],"language":"en"},

Systemic steroid treatment represents the first-line therapy for aGVHD and is associated with a response rate of 30% to 60%. Steroid-resistant patients have a poor prognosis with high transplantation-related mortality (TRM). Several second-line therapies have been proposed for the management of unresponsive aGVHD, without proven beneficial effects on patients\u0027 outcome or overall long-term survival. For these reasons, extracorporeal photochemotherapy/photopheresis (ECP), a cell-based approach to control GVHD that spares generalized immunosuppression, seems to be promising. In this study, we report the outcome of 72 consecutive pediatric patients treated with ECP between 1997 and 2013 for aGVHD. Among them, 21 patients had steroid-resistant aGVHD, 42 had steroid-dependent aGVHD, and 9 did not receive steroid as first-line therapy because of clinical contraindications. A complete response was obtained in 72% of patients, a partial response was observed in 11%, and there was no response in 17% of patients. At day \u002B180, TRM was 4% in the whole cohort; TRM was 3% and 20% among responders and nonresponders to ECP, respectively (P \u003C .0001). The 5-year overall survival was 71%, showing a difference between responders and nonresponders of 78% and 30%, respectively (P = .0004). The 5-year time to progression of primary disease was 81%, without any significant difference between the 2 groups. Moreover, the 5-year progression-free survival of primary disease was 72%, with a significant difference (P = .0007) between responders (79%) and nonresponders (30%) to ECP. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ECP is highly effective in aGVHD without a negative impact on primary disease.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calore, Elisabetta; Marson, Piero; Pillon, Marta; Tumino, Manuela; Tison, Tiziana; Mainardi, Chiara; De Silvestro, Giustina; Rossin, Sara; Franceschetto, Genny; Carraro, Elisa; Pescarin, Matilde; Varotto, Stefania; Destro, Roberta; Gazzola, Maria Vittoria; Basso, Giuseppe; Messina, Chiara","journal":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4d8c83e3ff35b55abe461b2f44cf1c3543c0fa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26183078/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879115004632; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879115004632; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2015.07.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECP","steroid-resistant aGVHD","steroid-dependent aGVHD","Steroid-resistant patients","progression of primary disease","management of unresponsive aGVHD","nonresponders","TRM","year progression-free survival of primary disease","year overall survival","host disease","line therapy","significant difference","partial response","response rate","complete response","consecutive pediatric patients","Systemic steroid treatment","long-term survival","year time","line therapies","study","high transplantation-related mortality","patients\u0027 outcome","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","cell-based approach","poor prognosis","control GVHD","beneficial effects","major cause of morbidity","photopheresis","negative impact","extracorporeal photochemotherapy","Abstract Acute graft","generalized immunosuppression","reasons","clinical contraindications","groups","conclusion","day","cohort"],"language":"en"},

The increasing availability of new rapid and sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction testing, should provide more accurate and timely diagnoses of viral respiratory infections in older adults in the near future.","publish_time":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Talbot, H.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 sequence of a Q1 Italian strain revealed a close relationship with sequences of the 624I strains circulating in Italy in the early 1990s and this led to the idea that 624I was an ancestor of the Q1 genotype. Despite the fact that most heterogeneity of IBVs occurs in the S1 gene, the sequence analysis of this gene alone was not sufficient to confirm or deny this hypothesis. In the present study, an Italian 624I (gammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/96) was fully sequenced for the first time and compared to all available complete Q1 genome sequences.

However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012\u20132015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: \u003C 60% weak performance; 60\u201379% moderate performance; \u226580% good performance. RESULTS: During 2012\u20132015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during December\u2013May. Data quality and completeness was \u003E 90% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored \u003E 70% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Babakazo, P\u00E9lagie; Kabamba-Tshilobo, Joelle; Wemakoy, Emile Okitolonda; Lubula, L\u00E9opold; Manya, L\u00E9onie Kitoko; Ilunga, Benoit Kebela; Disasuani, Wally; Nkwembe, Edith; Kavunga-Membo, Hugo; Changachanga, Jean-Claude; Muhemedi, Saleh; Tamfum, Jean-Jacques Muyembe; Tempia, Stefano","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/367aa0244a4b97d04590b92ba9dba13fccd07ce3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6902419.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823763/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-8008-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRC","ILI","SARI"],"locations":["Africa","Democratic Republic of Congo"],"keyphrases":["influenza sentinel surveillance system","influenza circulation","Influenza viruses","performance of established influenza surveillance systems","patients","moderate performance","periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems","data quality","good performance","weak performance","surveillance attributes","timely data","available data","proportional contribution of influenza virus","impact of seasonal influenza epidemics","SARI","DRC","stability","simplicity","evidence of data reliability","sentinel sites","continuous education of surveillance staff","timeliness","completeness","flexibility","acceptability","representativeness","samples","ISSS","utility","evaluated indicators","key variables","Prevention guidelines","prevention interventions","better understanding","better use","specific indicators","qualitative methods","limited resources","severe acute respiratory illness","acquisition of new key competences","clinicians","World Health Organization","patterns","improvement","epidemiology","Centers","Africa","areas","Disease Control","diagnosis","Democratic Republic of Congo","higher detection","BACKGROUND","actions","policymaking","vulnerable groups","strengths","Scores","provinces","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Viral RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and liver) and tested for Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, virus isolation was attempted in 9\u201311 day-old embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). In order to determine the prevalence of IBV serotype(s) in the flock, serum samples were screened by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using IBV antigens and antisera (Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts). Neither AIV nor NDV but IBV was detected in the tissue samples by RT-PCR. In addition, virus isolate obtained after four serial passages in ECE produced dwarfed, stunted, and hemorrhagic embryos, and the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR to be IBV. The serum samples were 100% seropositive for three serotypes with HI titres ranging from 5 to 12 Log(2). In this study, IBV was confirmed as the causative agent of the observed respiratory distress and drop in egg production. Also, the evidence of co-circulation of multiple IBV serotypes was established, this to the best of our knowledge is the first of such report in Nigeria.

This makes amyloid fibrils a challenging focus for inhibition studies because the peptides and proteins that form amyloid fibrils cannot be targeted based on a sequence motif. Most peptide inhibitors that target specific amyloidogenic proteins rely heavily on sequence recognition to ensure that the inhibitory peptide is able to bind its target. This approach is limited to targeting one amyloidogenic protein at a time. However, there is increasing evidence of cross-reactivity between amyloid-forming polypeptides. It has therefore become more useful to study the similarities between these proteins that goes beyond their sequence homology. Indeed, the observation that amyloidogenic proteins adopt similar secondary structures along the pathway to fibril formation opens the way to an interesting investigation: the development of inhibitors that could be universal amyloid traps. The review below will analyze two specific amyloidogenic proteins, \u03B1-synuclein and human amylin, and introduce a small number of peptides that have been shown to be capable of inhibiting the amyloidogenesis of both of these very dissimilar polypeptides. Some of the inhibitory peptide motifs may indeed, be applicable to A\u03B2 and other amyloidogenic systems.","publish_time":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sivanesam, Kalkena; Andersen, Niels","journal":"Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/023907d5dbdb76f3e1c3b38622cb60fe98c17479.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707943/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003986118307379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986118307379; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.01.032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific amyloidogenic proteins","variety of proteins","amyloid fibrils","amyloidogenic systems","peptide inhibitors","Abstract Amyloid fibril formation","sequence recognition","sequence motif","universal amyloid traps","little sequence homology","inhibitory peptide motifs","target","development of inhibitors","dissimilar polypeptides","small number of peptides","similar secondary structures","inhibition studies","pathway","\u03B1-synuclein","challenging focus","human amylin","interesting investigation","reactivity","observation","evidence of cross","A\u03B2","amyloidogenesis","time","similarities","review","approach"],"language":"en"},

Once it was shown that there is an increased risk for developing HAM/TSP associated with blood transfusion, screening for HTLV-1 among blood banks was implemented in Japan, United States, France, and the Netherlands.

To obtain more insight into the signals and molecular events that coordinate global host responses in the nucleus of coronavirus-infected cells, first, transcriptome dynamics was studied in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)-infected A549 and HuH7 cells, respectively, revealing a core signature of upregulated genes in these cells. Compared to treatment with the prototypical inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1, HCoV-229E replication was found to attenuate the inducible activity of the transcription factor (TF) NF-\u03BAB and to restrict the nuclear concentration of NF-\u03BAB subunits by (i) an unusual mechanism involving partial degradation of IKK\u03B2, NEMO and I\u03BAB\u03B1 and (ii) upregulation of TNFAIP3 (A20), although constitutive IKK activity and basal TNFAIP3 expression levels were shown to be required for efficient virus replication. Second, we characterized actively transcribed genomic regions and enhancers in HCoV-229E-infected cells and systematically correlated the genome-wide gene expression changes with the recruitment of Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and prototypical histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K36ac, H4K5ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1). The data revealed that, in HCoV-infected (but not IL-1-treated) cells, an extensive set of genes was activated without inducible p65 NF-\u03BAB being recruited. Furthermore, both HCoV-229E replication and IL-1 were shown to upregulate a small set of genes encoding immunomodulatory factors that bind p65 at promoters and require IKK\u03B2 activity and p65 for expression. Also, HCoV-229E and IL-1 activated a common set of 440 p65-bound enhancers that differed from another 992 HCoV-229E-specific enhancer regions by distinct TF-binding motif combinations. Taken together, the study shows that cytoplasmic RNA viruses fine-tune NF-\u03BAB signaling at multiple levels and profoundly reprogram the host cellular chromatin landscape, thereby orchestrating the timely coordinated expression of genes involved in multiple signaling, immunoregulatory and metabolic processes.","publish_time":"2017-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poppe, Michael; Wittig, Sascha; Jurida, Liane; Bartkuhn, Marek; Wilhelm, Jochen; M\u00FCller, Helmut; Beuerlein, Knut; Karl, Nadja; Bhuju, Sabin; Ziebuhr, John; Schmitz, M.

Although advances in antiviral research have led to successful therapies against several human viruses, still some of them cannot be eradicated from the host and most of them do not have any treatment available. Consequently, innovative antiviral therapies are urgently needed. In the past few years, research on G-quadruplexes (G4s) in viruses has boomed, providing powerful evidence for the regulatory role of G4s in key viral steps. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses have traced putative G4-forming sequences in the genome of almost all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically significant and their presence highly conserved. Since the genomes of viruses are remarkably variable, high conservation rates strongly suggest a crucial role of G4s in the viral replication cycle and evolution, emphasizing the possibility of targeting viral G4s as a new pharmacological approach in antiviral therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the formation and function of G4s in pathogens responsible for serious diseases, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis B and C, Ebola viruses, to cite a few. In this chapter, we present the state of the art on the structural and functional characterization of viral G4s in RNA viruses, DNA viruses and retroviruses. We also present the G4 ligands that provide further details on the viral G4 role and which, showing promising antiviral activity, which could be exploited for the development of innovative antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruggiero, Emanuela; Richter, Sara N.","journal":"Annual reports in medicinal chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdc40ef786bf3a2a8ab0cc411620bfd21a11333d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427223/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774320300142; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774320300142; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.armc.2020.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human viruses","RNA viruses","DNA viruses","Ebola viruses","Abstract Viruses","genomes of viruses","viral G4 role","function of G4s","antiviral research","crucial role of G4s","regulatory role of G4s","functional characterization of viral G4s","antiviral therapy","innovative antiviral therapies","viral replication cycle","key viral steps","promising antiviral activity","development of innovative antiviral agents","putative G4","G4 ligands","pathogens responsible","successful therapies","national economies","health","new pharmacological approach","high conservation rates","formation","Hepatitis B","serious diseases","G-quadruplexes","details","massive epidemics","powerful evidence","planet","overall welfare of societies","HIV","art","years","Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses","evolution","abundant organisms","distribution","possibility","retroviruses","presence","state","past","sequences","Recent studies","living beings","advances","treatment available","chapter","host"],"language":"en"},

Constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains. Thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity. In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection. Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses. This review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines.","publish_time":"2014-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tripp, Ralph A.; Tompkins, S.

Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal\u2013human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission.

While blood transfusion can be lifesaving, there are associated risks, particularly the transmission of blood-borne infections including human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses. Screening for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) to exclude blood donations at risk of transmitting infection from donors to recipients is a critical part of the process of ensuring that transfusion is as safe as possible. Effective screening for evidence of the presence of the most common and dangerous TTIs can reduce the risk of transmission to very low levels. Blood transfusion services should therefore establish efficient systems to ensure that all donated blood is correctly screened for the appropriate TTIs and that only nonreactive blood is issued for transfusion to patients.","publish_time":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhingra, N.; Kitchen, A.","journal":"Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d27fc654a3b5b7fc4703021f9874bfdff9abf4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157473.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012801238300163X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012801238300163X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission of blood","Blood transfusion services","blood collection","efficacious blood","nonreactive blood","issue of blood","donated blood","testing of blood donations","sufficient supplies of blood","suitability of prospective blood donors","transfusion-transmissible infections","patients","risk of transmission","dangerous TTIs","appropriate TTIs","provision of safe","efficient systems","lifesaving intervention","Effective screening","risk of transmitting infection","health care systems","human immunodeficiency virus","hepatitis B","essential role","patient management","processing","presence","assessment","C viruses","number of processes","recipients","associated risks","evidence","low levels","responsibility of governments"],"language":"en"},

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were screened for respiratory viruses by the polymerase chain reaction. TSLP, IL-33, and periostin were measured in NPAs. Clinical data were recorded. At least 1 virus was detected in 186 (87.3%) hospitalized infants: 149 (70%) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); 42 (19.7%) rhinovirus (HRV); 16 (7.5%) parainfluenza virus (PIV); 9 (4.2%) adenovirus; 10 (4.7%) bocavirus; and 7 (3.3%) metapneumovirus (hMPV). Infants with bronchiolitis had higher levels of TSLP (P = .02), IL-33 (P\u003C.001), and periostin (P = .003) than healthy controls. Detectable levels of TSLP and periostin were more frequent in virus-positive than in virus-negative patients (P = .05). TSLP and IL-33 were also more common in coinfections, mainly RSV and HRV, than in single-infections (P \u003C .05). No patient with bronchiolitis but with negative viral detection had detectable levels of nasal TSLP or IL-33. Infants with hospital stay \u22655 days were more likely to have detectable levels of nasal TSLP and periostin after adjusting by age (P = .01). Bronchiolitis by common respiratory viruses is associated with elevated nasal levels of TSLP, IL-33, and periostin, factors known to be important in the development of Th2-response. Respiratory viruses in early life might shift immune responses toward Th2, involving asthma, and allergic diseases.","publish_time":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Moreira, Ana; Ca\u00F1as, Jos\u00E9 Antonio; Pozo, Francisco; Sastre, Beatriz; Quevedo, Sergio; Casas, Inmaculada; Del Pozo, Victoria","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f6baf8f7385b9eee9a9c955a4c43783b0efd135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5419921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28471975/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000006787","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":["TSLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["periostin","IL","Detectable levels of TSLP","detectable levels of nasal TSLP","higher levels of TSLP","elevated nasal levels of TSLP","healthy infants","nasal airway secretion of TSLP","natural respiratory viral bronchiolitis","respiratory syncytial virus","infants exhibit","common respiratory viruses","virus-positive","parainfluenza virus","virus-negative patients","healthy controls","negative viral detection","RSV","HRV","development of Th2","years of age","allergic diseases","immune responses","early life","asthma","polymerase chain reaction","days","thymic stromal lymphopoietin","single-infections","study","coinfections","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","PIV","hospital","total","factors","role","Clinical data","metapneumovirus","hMPV","aim","attention","rhinovirus","NPAs","adenovirus","bocavirus"],"language":"en"},

Pulmonary and extra-pulmonary symptoms associated with M. pneumoniae infection are reported. M. pneumoniae is mainly epidemic in Denmark with the recurrence every 4-7(th) year. AIMS: Retrospectively, to describe the epidemiology and clinical features, in infants and children, during the M. pneumoniae epidemic in 2010 and 2011. METHODS: All children under the age of 16 that were tested for M. pneumoniae during the period 01.02.2010\u201331.01.2012 were included. Medical charts, as well as radiological findings, were reviewed for all children with M. pneumoniae. A post-hoc analysis of viral co-infections was done on part of the cohort. RESULTS: 134 of 746 children were tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR or serology. Positive tests were found in 65% of children seven years and older, in 30% of 2-6-year-olds and 4% of infants (less than two years of age). Viral co-infection was found in 27% of the tested samples. The clinical presentation was a cough, asthma-like symptoms and low-grade fever. Extra-pulmonary symptoms were common and presented as nausea/vomiting by 33% of the children and skin manifestations by 25%. 84% of the children had a chest x-ray taken, and there were positive radiological findings in 94% of these. CONCLUSION: M. pneumoniae also affected infants and young children and symptoms were similar to infections with respiratory viruses, but severe LRTI were also seen.

These recombinant proteins have a wide range of important applications, including vaccines and therapeutics for human and animal health, industrial enzymes, new materials and components of novel nano\u2010particles for various applications. The majority of recombinant proteins are produced by traditional biological \u201Cfactories,\u201D that is, predominantly mammalian and microbial cell cultures along with yeast and insect cells. However, these traditional technologies cannot satisfy the increasing market demand due to prohibitive capital investment requirements. During the last two decades, plants have been under intensive investigation to provide an alternative system for cost\u2010effective, highly scalable, and safe production of recombinant proteins. Although the genetic engineering of plant viral vectors for heterologous gene expression can be dated back to the early 1980s, recent understanding of plant virology and technical progress in molecular biology have allowed for significant improvements and fine tuning of these vectors.

Since filoviruses use a complex route of cell entry that depends on numerous cellular factors, we hypothesized that there may be drugs already approved for human use for other indications that interfere with signal transduction or other cellular processes required for their entry and hence have anti-filoviral properties. METHODS: We used authentic filoviruses and lentiviral particles pseudotyped with filoviral glycoproteins to identify and characterize such compounds. RESULTS: We discovered that amiodarone, a multi-ion channel inhibitor and adrenoceptor antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of filovirus cell entry at concentrations that are routinely reached in human serum during anti-arrhythmic therapy. A similar effect was observed with the amiodarone-related agent dronedarone and the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. Inhibition by amiodarone was concentration dependent and similarly affected pseudoviruses as well as authentic filoviruses. Inhibition of filovirus entry was observed with most but not all cell types tested and was accentuated by the pre-treatment of cells, indicating a host cell-directed mechanism of action. The New World arenavirus Guanarito was also inhibited by amiodarone while the Old World arenavirus Lassa and members of the Rhabdoviridae (vesicular stomatitis virus) and Bunyaviridae (Hantaan) families were largely resistant.

Within S the receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV host cell receptor. Both S and the RBD are highly immunogenic and both have been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Reported here is the X-ray crystal structure of the RBD in complex with the Fab of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody, F26G19, elicited by immunization with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV. The RBD\u2013F26G19 Fab complex represents the first example of the structural characterization of an antibody elicited by an immune response to SARS-CoV or any fragment of it. The structure reveals that the RBD surface recognized by F26G19 overlaps significantly with the surface recognized by ACE2 and, as such, suggests that F26G19 likely neutralizes SARS-CoV by blocking the virus\u2013host cell interaction.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pak, John E.; Sharon, Chetna; Satkunarajah, Malathy; Auperin, Thierry C.; Cameron, Cheryl M.; Kelvin, David J.; Seetharaman, Jayaraman; Cochrane, Alan; Plummer, Francis A.; Berry, Jody D.; Rini, James M.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/807010e4de2aee42d4eb9849b818aafb3dbeee20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094495.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609003374; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.03.042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609003374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19324051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV host cell receptor","inactivated SARS-CoV","RBD surface","host cell interaction","host cell attachment","host cell membranes","F26G19 Fab complex","ACE2","neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody","neutralizing antibodies","receptor binding domain","X-ray crystal structure","fusion","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","protein","example","immunization","angiotensin","immune response","structural characterization","enzyme","spike","fragment"],"language":"en"},

Despite intensive efforts, no effective vaccine has been developed against ALV because of mutations that lead to resistant forms. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop antiviral agents for the treatment of ALV infections and RNA interference (RNAi) is considered an effective antiviral strategy. RESULTS: In this study, the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) proviral genome, including the gag genes, were treated as targets for RNAi. Four pairs of miRNA sequences were designed and synthesized that targeted different regions of the gag gene. The screened target (i.e., the gag genes) was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0-77.3%. To avoid the generation of escape variants during virus infection, expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs were constructed using the multi-target serial strategy (against different regions of the gag, pol, and env genes). Multi-target miRNAs were shown to play a synergistic role in the inhibition of ALV-J replication, with an inhibition efficiency of viral replication ranging from 85.0-91.2%. CONCLUSION: The strategy of multi-target miRNAs might be an effective method for inhibiting ALV replication and the acquisition of resistant mutations.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Qing-Wen; Zhang, Zai-Ping; Wang, Wei; Tian, Jin; Xiao, Zhi-Guang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0988e41e28d6f9269e7198ec419142d0a81c7a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3296551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188662/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALV-J","replication of ALV","inhibition of ALV","inhibiting ALV replication","J replication","strategy of multi-target miRNAs","gag genes","multi-target serial strategy","treatment of ALV infections","screened target","expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs","effective antiviral strategy","avian leukosis virus subgroup J","virus infection","effective method","effective vaccine","inhibition efficiency of viral replication","RNAi","env genes","targeted different regions","acquisition of resistant mutations","antiviral agents","resistant forms","proviral genome","generation of escape variants","major infectious disease","RNA interference","study","pol","BACKGROUND","poultry industry","synergistic role","dire need","intensive efforts","targets","CONCLUSION","pairs of miRNA sequences","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, because an infection event is seldom directly observable, the present study aims to construct a diagnostic model that predicts the probability of MERS diagnosis given the time from immigration to illness onset among imported cases which are suspected of MERS. Addressing censoring by considering the transmission dynamics in an exporting country, we demonstrate that the illness onset within 2 days from immigration is suggestive of influenza. Two exceptions to suspect MERS even for those with illness onset within 2 days since immigration are (i) when we observe substantial community transmissions of MERS and (ii) when the cases are at high risk of MERS (e.g. cases with close contact in hospital or household). It is vital to collect the information of the incubation period upon emergence of a novel infectious disease, and moreover, in our model, the fundamental transmission dynamics including the initial growth rate has to be explored to differentiate the disease diagnoses with non-specific symptoms.","publish_time":"2014-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ejima, Keisuke; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2c0ea430fcb5fa87540b34411b2283732962299.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094128.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519313005894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406808/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519313005894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.12.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probability of MERS diagnosis","clinical symptoms of MERS","immigration","illness onset","high risk of MERS","substantial community transmissions of MERS","imported cases","days","incubation period","non-specific symptoms","fundamental transmission dynamics","diagnostic model","disease diagnoses","differential diagnosis","suggestive of influenza","novel infectious disease","emergence","time","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome","close contact","initial growth rate","hospital","information","present study","exporting country","household","infection event","censoring","exceptions"],"language":"en"},

Many emerging infectious pathogens are transmitted by highly mobile species, including bats, which can act as spill-over hosts for pathogenic viruses. Over three years, we investigated the seroepidemiology of paramyxoviruses and Australian bat lyssavirus in a range-expanding fruit bat, the Grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), in a new camp in Adelaide, South Australia. Over six, biannual, sampling sessions, we quantified median florescent intensity (MFI) antibody levels for four viruses for a total of 297 individual bats using a multiplex Luminex binding assay. Where appropriate, florescence thresholds were determined using finite mixture modelling to classify bats\u2019 serological status. Overall, apparent seroprevalence of antibodies directed at Hendra, Cedar and Tioman virus antigens was 43.2%, 26.6% and 95.7%, respectively. We used hurdle models to explore correlates of seropositivity and antibody levels when seropositive. Increased body condition was significantly associated with Hendra seropositivity (Odds ratio = 3.67; p = 0.002) and Hendra virus levels were significantly higher in pregnant females (p = 0.002). While most bats were seropositive for Tioman virus, antibody levels for this virus were significantly higher in adults (p \u003C 0.001). Unexpectedly, all sera were negative for Australian bat lyssavirus. Temporal variation in antibody levels suggests that antibodies to Hendra virus and Tioman virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings suggest a common exposure to Hendra virus and other paramyxoviruses in this flying fox camp in South Australia.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boardman, Wayne S.

Because of the increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the cost of prescription drugs, and the potential adverse reactions to them, the present management of acute bronchitis has important shortcomings.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. Interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.","publish_time":"2011-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasmy, Hanaa; Mikhael, Nancy; Ismail, Somaia","journal":"Arch Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20dd62d0387e8b4231d67af2eaf757767492656e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3258774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291810/; https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2011.24144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psoriatic skin lesions","uninvolved skin","lesional psoriatic skin","keratinocytes","psoriatic lesions","change of expression","studied patients IL","lesional skin biopsy","increased IL","months of treatment","gene expression analysis","study","clinical severity of psoriasis","patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis","concept of psoriasis","disease duration","autoimmune disease","interleukin","therapeutic interventions","comparison","form of topical steroids","T cell","oral systemic methotrexate","correlation","real time quantitative PCR","end","preventive approaches","METHODS","improved outcomes","CONCLUSIONS","INTRODUCTION","aim","MATERIAL","RESULTS","biopsies"],"language":"en"},

These immune modulating factors can include endotoxin from gram negative bacterial outer membrane component, commonly referred to as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, our objective was to examine the relationship between intestinal barrier integrity, endotoxin and inflammation with feed efficiency (FE), using pig lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) as a model. Twelve gilts (62 \u00B1 3 kg BW) from the low RFI (LRFI, more efficient) and 12 from the high RFI (HRFI, less efficient) were used. Individual performance data was recorded for 5 wk. At the end of the experimental period, ADFI of LRFI pigs was less (P \u003C 0.001), ADG not different between the 2 lines (P = 0.72) but the G:F of LRFI pigs was greater than for HRFI pigs (P = 0.019). Serum endotoxin concentration (P \u003C 0.01) and the acute phase protein haptoglobin (P \u003C 0.05) were greater in HRFI pigs. Transepithelial resistance of the ileum, transport of fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled-Dextran and-LPS in ileum and colon, as well as tight junction protein mRNA expression in ileum, did not differ between the lines, indicating the 2 lines did not differ in transport characteristics at the intestinal level. Ileum inflammatory markers, myeloperoxidase (P \u003C 0.05) and IL-8 (P \u003C 0.10), were found to be greater in HRFI pigs. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was significantly increased in the LRFI pigs in ileum and liver tissues and negatively correlated with blood endotoxin (P \u003C 0.05). Lysozyme activity in the liver was not different between the lines; however, the LRFI pigs had a twofold greater lysozyme activity in ileum (P \u003C 0.05). Despite the difference in their activity, ALP or lysozyme mRNA expression was not different between the lines in either tissue. Decreased endotoxin and inflammatory markers and the enhanced activities of antimicrobial enzymes in the LRFI line may not fully explain the difference in the FE between the lines, but they have the potential to prevent the growth potential in HRFI pigs. Further studies are needed to identify the other mechanisms that may contribute to the greater endotoxin and acute phase proteins in the HRFI pigs and the greater FE in the LRFI pigs.","publish_time":"2013-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mani, V.; Harris, A.

The difference of serotypes and tissue tropisms in kidneys between ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 may have been contributed by the uptake of the S1 gene by a ck/CH/LDL/091022-like virus from a 4/91-like strain.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with ARD during 2009\u20132012. HRV-C was genotyped by sequencing the VP4/VP2 coding region. Among the 1,567 NPAs obtained, 223 (14.2%) were HRV positive, and 75.3% of these 223 NPAs were co-infected with other viruses. HRV-A (54.7%) and HRV-C (39.9%) accounted for the majority of HRV infections. Logistic regression models demonstrated significant associations between HRV-A, HRV-C, and asthma attacks, as well as between HRV-C and wheezing. A phylogenetic tree showed that HRV-C2 was the predominant type of HRV-C, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17. Three novel genotypes were proposed on the basis of a low identity with the known HRVs. Our results showed that HRV-A and HRV-C were the predominant types of HRV infection, and HRV-C showed a high genetic variation in Chongqing, China. HRV infection was associated with asthma attacks and wheezing; furthermore, HRV infections played a minor role in causing severe pneumonia.

AD typically uses organic materials as feedstock and, through a series of biological processes, produces methane. Farmyard manure and slurry (FYM\u0026S) are important AD feedstock and are typically mixed with agricultural waste, grass and/or food wastes. The feedstock may contain many different pathogens which can survive the AD process and hence also possibly be present in the final digestate. In this study, a semi-quantitative screening tool was developed to rank pathogens of potential health concern emerging from AD digestate. A scoring system was used to categorise likely inactivation during AD, hazard pathways and finally, severity as determined from reported human mortality rates, number of global human-deaths and infections per 100,000 populations. Five different conditions including mesophilic and thermophilic AD and three different pasteurisation conditions were assessed in terms of specific pathogen inactivation. In addition, a number of scenarios were assessed to consider foodborne incidence data from Ireland and Europe and to investigate the impact of raw FYM\u0026S application (without AD and pasteurisation). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the score for the mortality rate (S3) was the most sensitive parameter (rank coefficient 0.49) to influence the final score S; followed by thermal inactivation score (S1, 0.25) and potential contamination pathways (S2, 0.16). Across all the scenarios considered, the screening tool prioritised Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., norovirus, Streptococcus pyogenes, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella typhi (followed by S. paratyphi), Clostridium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter coli as the highest-ranking pathogens of human health concern resulting from AD digestate in Ireland. This tool prioritises potentially harmful pathogens which can emerge from AD digestate and highlights where regulation and intervention may be required.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nag, Rajat; Whyte, Paul; Markey, Bryan K.; O\u0027Flaherty, Vincent; Bolton, Declan; Fenton, Owen; Richards, Karl G.; Cummins, Enda","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f978d584b129046e3f2129353f04d04b987a640.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126561.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32050363/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971936293X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896971936293X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Ireland"],"keyphrases":["AD digestate","thermophilic AD","AD process","important AD feedstock","different pathogens","final digestate","final score S","pathogens of potential health concern","different conditions","harmful pathogens","highest-ranking pathogens of human health concern","thermal inactivation score","different pasteurisation conditions","S application","human mortality rates","likely inactivation","number of scenarios","Ireland","number of global human-deaths","semi-quantitative screening tool","potential contamination pathways","screening tool prioritised Cryptosporidium parvum","Campylobacter coli","Salmonella typhi","terms of specific pathogen inactivation","hazard pathways","rank coefficient","impact of raw FYM","norovirus","Streptococcus pyogenes","Europe","Listeria monocytogenes","enteropathogenic","EPEC","S3","S1","foodborne incidence data","grass","Clostridium","sensitive parameter","paratyphi","infections","Mycobacterium","study","slurry","severity","highlights","regulation","Farmyard manure","series of biological processes","cleanest producers of green energy","methane","agricultural waste","intervention","S2","Abstract Anaerobic digestion","organic materials","food wastes","scoring system","populations","sensitivity analysis","addition"],"language":"en"},

The identity of Cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. C. parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2\u20133-week-old calves with diarrhoea, corresponding to the age at which animals died. Three Cryptosporidium species were identified, including C. parvum (n = 51), C. bovis (n = 1), and C. ryanae (n = 1). All C. parvum isolates were further identified as subtype IIdA15G1. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium parvum was likely to be most responsible for diarrhoea and death. This is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by C. parvum IIdA15G1 in Chinese dairy cattle.","publish_time":"2014-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Zhaohui; Wang, Rongjun; Huang, Jianying; Wang, Haiyan; Zhao, Jinfeng; Luo, Nannan; Li, Junqiang; Zhang, Zhenjie; Zhang, Longxian","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70419bf8c8f69f99d3127967e958ead655296b3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4254006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25430474/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0529-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cryptosporidium parvum","parvum IIdA15G1","parvum isolates","identity of Cryptosporidium species","pre-weaned calves","infected calves","week-old calves","DNA sequence analysis","animals","severe diarrhoea","zoonotic parasites responsible","common mammalian species","rRNA gene","investigated farm","subtype IIdA15G1","Chinese dairy cattle","restriction fragment length polymorphism","PCR","small subunit","polymerase chain reaction","RFLP","diarrhoeal diseases","SSU","kDa glycoprotein","Ningxia Autonomous Region of Northwestern China","reservoirs","cryptosporidiosis outbreak","faecal samples","gp60","humans","antibiotic therapy","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","highest infection rate","FINDINGS","report","age","death","bovis","ryanae"],"language":"en"},

Clinical presentation is poorly specific and the great antigenic and genetic variability of HRVs renders the biological diagnosis complex. Here, we have evaluated several molecular diagnostic protocols, including Taqman probe-based and intercalating agent-based RT-PCR assays. METHODS: 5,627 respiratory samples sent to the laboratory of Virology of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France, from March 2011 to February 2012, were tested using a real-time RT-PCR assay in the 5\u2019NCR of the rhinoviral genome that associated a Taqman probe and the detection of DNA-BOXTO-dye complexes. A sample of 500 BOXTO-positive samples were further tested using the same probe assay (without BOXTO), and a SYBR Green assay (using the same amplification primers). The specific amplification of HRV sequences was assessed by NGS amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: The Taqman probe RT-PCR assay identified 696/5,627 samples (12,4%) as HRV-positive. BOXTO-positive samples included all probe-positive samples and 1,913 additional samples, of which only 24.3% were confirmed by sequencing. The SYBR Green assay was more specific (16/550 samples were probe-negative/SYBR Green-positive, all confirmed by 5\u2032NCR sequencing), but 3/500 samples were probe-positive/SYBR Green-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difficulty in detecting HRVs in clinical samples using a single molecular detection system. Amongst the 3 systems tested, the best compromise was obtained with the SYBR Green assay, which, by comparison with our probe-based assay provided an improved sensitivity without altering the detection specificity. Interestingly, a majority of probe-negative/BOXTO- or SYBR Green-positive samples were not associated with mutations in the sequence targeted by the probe. Sequence-based modifications of the secondary structure of the HRV 5\u2032NCR may be associated with a limited access to the probe hybridisation region. Further investigations may identify a test combining a probe based- and an intercalating agent-based detection, which will significantly improve the diagnosis of HRV infections.","publish_time":"2014-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dupouey, Julien; Ninove, Laetitia; Ferrier, Vanessa; Py, Odile; Gazin, C\u00E9line; Thirion-Perrier, Laurence; de Lamballerie, Xavier","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a458a68d7dce3d20796e90e2da2daa24c8c748d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3936951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","HRV","NGS"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["probe-positive samples","probe assay","probe-based assay","BOXTO-positive samples","SYBR Green-positive samples","majority of probe","SYBR Green assay","respiratory samples","clinical samples","HRV-positive","Taqman probe RT-PCR assay","additional samples","SYBR Green-negative","probe hybridisation region","real-time RT-PCR assay","intercalating agent-based detection","diagnosis of HRV infections","Sequence-based modifications","NCR sequencing","intercalating agent-based RT-PCR assays","specific amplification of HRV sequences","detection of DNA","detection specificity","BOXTO-dye complexes","single molecular detection system","RESULTS","NGS amplicon sequencing","Clinical presentation","amplification primers","genetic variability of HRVs","molecular diagnostic protocols","biological diagnosis complex","major causative agents of acute respiratory tract infections","age group","important contributing factors of childhood morbidity","improved sensitivity","laboratory of Virology","difficulty","secondary structure","University Hospitals of Marseille","comparison","Human Rhinoviruses","limited access","mortality","rhinoviral genome","best compromise","France","BACKGROUND","mutations","systems","CONCLUSIONS","test","METHODS","investigations"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory viral infections may be associated with acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. The cornerstone of influenza prevention is annual vaccination and in some cases antiviral prophylaxis. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and other antivirals is reviewed. Prevention of RSV is limited to prophylaxis with palivizumab in select children.

Two general types of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain many translation initiation factors, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched for proteins involved in RNA turnover. Because of the inverse relationship between appearance of RNA granules and persistence of translation, many viruses must subvert RNA granule function for replicative purposes. Here we discuss the viruses and mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Several themes have emerged for manipulation of RNA granules by viruses: (1) disruption of RNA granules at the mid-phase of infection, (2) prevention of RNA granule assembly throughout infection and (3) co-opting of RNA granule proteins for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction. Viruses must employ one or multiple of these routes for a robust and productive infection to occur. The possible role for RNA granules in promoting innate immune responses poses an additional reason why viruses must counteract the effects of RNA granules for efficient replication.","publish_time":"2013-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reineke, Lucas C.; Lloyd, Richard E.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c65b00c6e7ef5ff3440a2c0ca5d5417317f365ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3611887.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.11.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682212005909; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212005909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23290869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of RNA granules","appearance of RNA granules","Abstract RNA granules","manipulation of RNA granules","disruption of RNA granules","RNA turnover","stress granules","general types of RNA granules","RNA granule function","viruses","co-opting of RNA granule proteins","prevention of RNA granule assembly","P-bodies","processing bodies","productive infection","synthesis of viral proteins","mid-phase of infection","persistence of translation","viral reproduction","translation initiation factors","cells","innate immune responses","parallel roles","structures","key regulatory measures","additional reason","mammals","yeast","gene expression","routes","replicative purposes","SGs","inverse relationship","efficient replication","mechanisms","possible role","PBs","themes"],"language":"en"},

The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population.

According to this approach, the main strategic priorities of health policy in the European Union for the period 2014\u20132020 are: (1) Prevention and health promotion (to combat diseases associated with the modern way of life), (2) Protection from cross-border threats (to address the external impact from cross-border relations, combating epidemics, pandemics), (3) Viability (to address the lack of resources by adopting innovation), (4) Accessibility (to assure the access to medical expertise).Therefore, the key priorities are the prevention of disease and the improvement of life in good health, the patient safety and quality of health services, and the readiness to manage crises and health risks.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soulis, Sotiris; Sarris, Marcos; Pierrakos, George; Goula, Aspasia; Koutitsas, George; Gkioka, Vasiliki","journal":"Cord Blood Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f107ae357b97e66f3fb9c0efb80858dc5f257272.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149613.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124077850000256; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124077850000256","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["health indicators","good health","health status","health risks","health system","health promotion","quality of health services","changing health needs","current health policies","Abstract Health planning","life expectancy","total health care expenditure","improvement of life","main strategic priorities of health policy","potential years of life","causes of mortality","population","modern way of life","chronic diseases","avoidable mortality","external causes","cross-border relations","cross-border threats","continuous improvement","external impact","key priorities","prevention of disease","patient safety","differences","heart","brain","necessity","disabilities","readiness","European Union","epidemiological spectrum","variability","pandemics","indices of morbidity","epidemics","lead","Protection","new trends","innovation","changes","bodies","approach","cancer","Recent developments","crises","goods","age","lack of resources","medical expertise","Accessibility","context","Viability","period","group","focus"],"language":"en"},

Design We encountered an adult patient with severe bronchiolitis in the absence of pneumonia due to M pneumoniae. To determine the relative frequency of such a condition, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adults over a 4-year period with a hospital discharge diagnosis of \u201Cbronchiolitis\u201D from a university hospital. Setting University Hospital of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. Study subjects From 1994 to 1998, 10 adult inpatients were identified with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. There were two with respiratory bronchiolitis, one with panbronchiolitis, one patient with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and six with acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. Including the initial patient, three had a definitive clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis. Results The three adult patients with bronchiolitis due to M pneumoniae are unusual because they occurred in the absence of radiographic features of a lobar or patchy alveolar pneumonia. Hospital admission was occasioned by the severity of symptoms and gas exchange abnormalities. One patient had bronchiolitis as well as organizing pneumonia (BOOP) that responded favorably to corticosteroid treatment. The other two had high-resolution CT findings diagnostic of an acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. One of the patients with inflammatory bronchiolitis had an unusual pattern of marked ventilation and perfusion defects localized predominantly to the left lung. All three had restrictive ventilatory impairment on physiologic testing. Conclusions In adults, Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis without pneumonia is rarely reported, but in hospitalized patients, it may be more common than expected and may be associated with severe physiologic disturbances.","publish_time":"1999-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Edward D.; Kalayanamit, Tul; Lynch, David A.; Tuder, Rubin; Arndt, Patrick; Winn, Robert; Schwarz, Marvin I.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5ae3fedb139b257c9348cb60cfc7d3c162dc2ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094532.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369216377613; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369216377613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of bronchiolitis","severe bronchiolitis","respiratory bronchiolitis","Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis","acute inflammatory bronchiolitis","bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia","adult Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced bronchiolitis","absence of pneumonia","university hospital","adult patients","hospital discharge diagnosis","adult inpatients","initial patient","Hospital admission","patchy alveolar pneumonia","definitive clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma","BOOP","hospitalized patients","severe physiologic disturbances","Study subjects","Study objectives","physiologic testing","University of Colorado Health Sciences Center","absence of radiographic features","medical records of adults","unusual pattern of marked ventilation","perfusion defects","Denver","high-resolution CT findings diagnostic","severity of symptoms","year period","panbronchiolitis","gas exchange abnormalities","restrictive ventilatory impairment","hospitalization","condition","Conclusions","left lung","relative frequency","Design","corticosteroid treatment"],"language":"en"},

The misinformation generated from this topic had caused great confusion and public concern. OBJECTIVE: Our goals were to analyze the trend and contents of the relevant posts during the outbreak. We also aimed to understand the characteristics of the misinformation and to provide suggestions to reduce public misconception on social media during the emerging disease outbreak. METHODS: The original microblog posts were collected from China\u2019s Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo using a combination of keywords between April 1, 2013 and June 2, 2013. We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts. Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria. The posts\u2019 characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category. We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts. RESULTS: A total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages. The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under \u201Cmisleading messages\u201D occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under \u201Crefuting messages\u201D outnumbered them. The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts. The proportion of \u201Cmisleading messages\u201D in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%). The popular misleading posts appeared to be short and consisted of personal narratives, which were easily disseminated on social media. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested the importance of responding to common questions and misconceptions on social media platforms from the beginning of disease outbreaks. Authorities need to release clear and reliable information related to the popular topics early on. The microbloggers posting correct information should be empowered and their posts could be promoted to clarify false information. Equal importance should be attached to clarify misinformation in both the outbreak and nonoutbreak areas.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Bin; Shao, Jian; Liu, Kui; Cai, Gaofeng; Jiang, Zhenggang; Huang, Yuru; Gu, Hua; Jiang, Jianmin","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5897620.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.8198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sina Weibo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["popular misleading posts","previous posts","daily number of posts","number of relevant posts","original microblog posts","highest mean rank of posts","misleading messages","social media platforms","daily posting number","misinformation","number of reported cases","emerging disease outbreak","daily trend","popular topics","beginning of week","refuting messages","emerging avian influenza","popular avian-origin food","weeks","hot topic","beginning of disease outbreaks","reliable information","correct information","false information","microbloggers","Tencent Weibo","lowest mean rank of followers","public misconception","public concern","epidemic areas","nonoutbreak areas","posts\u2019 characteristics","Equal importance","China\u2019s Sina Weibo","common questions","misconceptions","sudden increase","relationship","great confusion","types","suggestions","total","places","unified sorting criteria","geographic locations","combination of keywords","high level","H7N9","METHODS","contents","personal narratives","Authorities","CONCLUSIONS","findings","vs","goals","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","proportion","Content analyses","OBJECTIVE","category","analysis"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism(s) of OFSCs regulating macrophage activity in a cytokine-inducible fashion. METHODS: LPS (100 ng/ml)-activated macrophages were treated by conditioned medium from OFSCs (OFSCs-CM) or non-contact cultured with OFSCs for 6 hours. The potency of OFSCs on macrophage proliferation and pro-inflammation ability were determined. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, inducible immuno-modulatory factors in OFSCs, were investigated. Deep sequencing analysis as well as interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and genes of immuno-modulators in OFSCs induced by activated macrophages was predicted by miRTar. Transfection of miRNA inhibitor into OFSCs was performed. Real-time RT-PCR and transplantation of OFSCs into mice with LPS-induced ALI confirmed the in vitro and in vivo mechanism. RESULTS: The paracrine effect of OFSCs on inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine release was more potent than induction of macrophage G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. OFSCs-CM suppressed LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthetase and the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta expression in macrophages. Under non-contact culture, LPS-activated macrophages effectively triggered the expression of soluble immuno-modulating factors in OFSCs, i.e., IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF RII). Under miRTar prediction, miR-671-5p was identified as a critical microRNA in regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors in OFSCs response to macrophages. The baseline level of miR-671-5p was high in OFSCs, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p upon co-culture with activated macrophages was observed. MiR-671-5p inhibitor transfection into OFSCs selectively enhanced the IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expressions. In addition, inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability against LPS-induced ALI. CONCLUSION: The paracrine effect of OFSCs inhibits the pro-inflammatory ability and proliferation of macrophages. The immune-modulation capacity of OFSCs can be triggered by activated macrophages, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p enhances OFSC immuno-modulation ability by up-regulating IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expression.","publish_time":"2014-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lien, Gi-Shih; Liu, Jen-Fang; Chien, Ming-Hsien; Hsu, Wei-Tse; Chang, Tzu-Hao; Ku, Chia-Chi; Ji, Andrea Tung-Qian; Tan, Peng; Hsieh, Ting-Lieh; Lee, Liang-Ming; Ho, Jennifer H","journal":"Stem Cell Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fcf1d545d5c10fbe83bbbd9dab8391fb748be7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4247678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/scrt486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["TNF","RA","OFSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transplantation of OFSCs","OFSCs response","potency of OFSCs","paracrine effect of OFSCs","LPS-activated macrophages","immune-modulation capacity of OFSCs","proliferation of macrophages","regulation of miR","LPS-induced ALI","pro-inflammatory ability","paracrine regulation of macrophage","inhibition of miR","macrophage proliferation","suppressed LPS","inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine release","pro-inflammation ability","p inhibitor transfection","Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines","macrophage activity","expression of soluble immuno-modulating factors","OFSC immuno-modulation ability","inducible immuno-modulatory factors","baseline level of miR","anti-inflammatory ability","beta expression","regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors","induction of macrophage G0","cytokine-inducible fashion","sTNF RII expressions","genes of immuno-modulators","non-contact culture","Transfection of miRNA inhibitor","soluble TNF receptor type","mediated cytokine-storm","inducible nitric oxide synthetase","TNF-\u03B1","critical microRNA","receptor antagonist","co-culture","molecular mechanism","miRTar prediction","G1 cell cycle arrest","tumor necrosis factor-alpha","systemic orbital fat-derived stem cell","dioxygenase","mice","previous works","interaction","extensive acute lung injury","ameliorating lipopolysaccharide","conditioned medium","Real-time RT-PCR","interleukin","indoleamine","Deep sequencing analysis","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","study","METHODS","addition","hours"],"language":"en"},

Although apparently not pathogenic in their reservoir hosts, some viruses from bats severely affect other mammals, including humans. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Nipah and Hendra viruses. Factors underlying high viral diversity in bats are the subject of speculation. We hypothesize that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this host\u2013virus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts.","publish_time":"2014-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Shea, Thomas J.; Cryan, Paul M.; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Fooks, Anthony R.; Hayman, David T.S.; Luis, Angela D.; Peel, Alison J.; Plowright, Raina K.; Wood, James L.N.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/504684906ab86a5130b59c2557ec73e2226f67e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4012789.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2005.130539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bats","Marburg viruses","Hendra viruses","bat viruses","large diversity of zoonotic viruses","high-profile zoonotic viruses","mammals","sources of high viral diversity","viral parasites","febrile response","fever response","reservoir hosts","natural hosts","Ebola","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses","body temperature analogous","daily cycle","coexistence","intensive selective force","metabolism","Examples","Nipah","virus interaction","Factors","evolutionary scale","factor common","subject of speculation","flight","humans"],"language":"en"},

Coronaviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), but the mechanisms by which M proteins are transported from their site of synthesis, the ER, to the budding site remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the intracellular trafficking of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) M protein. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that the MERS-CoV M protein is retained intracellularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and we identified two motifs in the distal part of the C-terminal domain as being important for this specific localization. We identified the first motif as a functional diacidic DxE ER export signal, because substituting Asp-211 and Glu-213 with alanine induced retention of the MERS-CoV M in the ER. The second motif, (199)KxGxYR(204), was responsible for retaining the M protein in the TGN. Substitution of this motif resulted in MERS-CoV M leakage toward the plasma membrane. We further confirmed the role of (199)KxGxYR(204) as a TGN retention signal by using chimeras between MERS-CoV M and the M protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Our results indicated that the C-terminal domains of both proteins determine their specific localization, namely TGN and ERGIC/cis-Golgi for MERS-M and IBV-M, respectively. Our findings indicate that MERS-CoV M protein localizes to the TGN because of the combined presence of an ER export signal and a TGN retention motif.","publish_time":"2019-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perrier, Anabelle; Bonnin, Ariane; Desmarets, Lowiese; Danneels, Adeline; Goffard, Anne; Rouill\u00E9, Yves; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35c9282c1b7a5918691efe6f35ca60111bfd590c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6768645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399512/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.008964; http://www.jbc.org/content/294/39/14406.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGN"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","TGN retention motif","TGN retention signal","major protein component","specific localization","structural proteins","protein of infectious bronchitis virus","functional diacidic DxE ER export signal","ERGIC","cis-Golgi","IBV","KxGxYR","Golgi intermediate compartment","alanine induced retention","trans-Golgi network","C-terminal domains","Subcellular localization analyses","viral envelope","viral assembly","essential role","site of synthesis","budding site","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","endoplasmic reticulum","substituting Asp","Glu","combined presence","chimeras","intracellular trafficking","leakage","Coronaviruses bud","plasma membrane","results","mechanisms","Substitution","findings","motifs"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. METHODS: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. RESULTS: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for \u22651 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (\u003C18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18\u201349 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (\u226550 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P \u003C 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary. CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with ARI, 69% of visits were associated with a viral etiology.

Taken together, these results suggest that there might be ADK-specific binding site in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigations with diverse ADKs to provide valuable insights into rational design of specific SCV Hel inhibitors.","publish_time":"2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Chaewoon; Lee, Jin Moo; Lee, Na-Ra; Jin, Bong-Suk; Jang, Kyoung Jin; Kim, Dong-Eun; Jeong, Yong-Joo; Chong, Youhoon","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08f62fb3d767dc6d27afcc1ae6054e05ec27b329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127030.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X09001528; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X09001528; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19233643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ADK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse ADKs","helicase activities","rational design of specific SCV Hel inhibitors","ADK-specific binding site","ADK analogues","binding modes","helicase ATPase activity","NTPase","ion binding sites","antiviral activities","FRET-based assay","Phosphate release assay","duplex DNA-unwinding activity","potential inhibitors of SARS CoV","significant impact","valuable insights","anti-HCV aryl diketoacids","Zn2","investigations","good metal chelators","bismuth complexes","substituent","results"],"language":"en"},

Each assay modality has unique pros and cons; therefore, incorporation of a battery of tests using traditional culture-based, molecular and serological diagnostics into diagnostic algorithms is often required. As such, laboratories face challenges in assay development, test evaluation, and subsequent quality assurance. In this review, we describe the different testing modalities available for the ongoing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic including cell culture, nucleic acid amplification, antigen detection, and antibody detection assays. Applications of such tests in both acute clinical and epidemiological investigation settings are highlighted. Using the MERS epidemic as an example, we illustrate the various challenges faced by laboratories in test development and implementation in the setting of a rapidly emerging infectious disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the long\u2010term outcome of cats with AMG without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass (CMM). ANIMALS: Eight cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence of a CMM. METHODS: Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of an identifiable CMM, or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. RESULTS: All cats had an excellent long\u2010term outcome, achieving immune remission within 6 months of diagnosis, including 4 cats that did not receive any treatment and whose natural course of disease involved spontaneous remission. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous, and skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability induced or exacerbated by the wheelbarrow exercise stress test were the most consistent abnormalities associated with AMG. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence a CMM have a favorable outcome and frequently achieve immune remission. Moreover, the natural history of AMG in cats includes spontaneous remission when there is no evidence of a CMM. Attempting to rule out the presence of a CMM therefore refines prognosis, and treatment is not always necessary in this disease population.","publish_time":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mignan, Thomas; Garosi, Laurent; Targett, Mike; Lowrie, Mark","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfe337afa069a02e96adf6894819e7928f8c4534.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6979264.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31746510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMG","CMM","CBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of AMG","long\u2010term outcome of cats","natural history of AMG","immune remission","spontaneous remission","evidence","identifiable CMM","medical records of cats","treatment","favorable outcome","excellent long\u2010term outcome","natural course of disease","occurrence of immune","disease population","presence","Inclusion criteria","months of diagnosis","Clinical presentation","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","Exclusion criteria","serum biochemistry","thoracic imaging","measurement of creatine kinase","skeletal muscle weakness","wheelbarrow exercise stress test","cranial mediastinal mass","consistent abnormalities","fatigability","administration of methimazole","Retrospective case series","METHODS","veterinary referral hospitals","BACKGROUND","myasthenia gravis","CONCLUSION","prognosis","information","carbimazole","CBC","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","ANIMALS"],"language":"en"},

Long-term studies may help better understand epidemiological trends and changes in circulating genotypes over time. PURPOSE: Using a large biobank of samples from hospitalized, adenovirus-positive patients over a 20-year period, we aimed to analyze long-term epidemiological trends and genotypic relatedness among circulating HAdV strains. METHODS: Based on samples from hospitalized patients confirmed to be HAdV positive in Bern, Switzerland, from 1998 to 2017, and on their associated demographic and clinical data, we identified epidemiological trends and risk factors associated with HAdV infection. HAdV genotyping was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the hypervariable hexon gene. The obtained sequences were phylogenetically compared with sequences from international HAdV strains. RESULTS: HAdV was identified in 1302 samples tested. Cases of HAdV infection were reported throughout the years with no clear seasonality. Upper respiratory tract samples, conjunctivitis swabs, and stool had the highest positivity rate (56.2%, 18.7%, and 14.2% of the cases, respectively). HAdV infection was highest among children \u22644 years old. Increased number of HAdV cases were observed in years 2009 (n = 110) and 2010 (n =112). HAdV8 was the predominant genotype among patients older than 20 years, and was mostly associated with ophthalmic infection. Predominant genotypes among children \u22644 years old were HAdV1, HAdV2, and HAdV3, which were mostly associated with respiratory tract infections. Recurring peaks of increased HAdV cases were evidenced every 4 years among children \u22644 years old. CONCLUSION: Our study gives novel insights on long-term epidemiological trends and phylogenetic relatedness among circulating HAdV strains in Switzerland, country in which little data on HAdV prevalence and diversity was so far available.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akello, Joyce Odeke; Kamgang, Richard; Barbani, Maria Teresa; Suter-Riniker, Franziska; Leib, Stephen L; Ramette, Alban","journal":"Clin Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5b526ffb5dc9a27ebe12c77eeda92cb9794938a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147615.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/clep.s246352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["HAdV positive","HAdV prevalence","HAdV genotyping","Cases of HAdV infection","circulating HAdV strains","international HAdV strains","Increased number of HAdV cases","years old","Recurring peaks of increased HAdV cases","long-term epidemiological trends","children","circulating genotypes","hospitalized patients","ophthalmic infection","adenovirus-positive patients","Upper respiratory tract samples","Switzerland","clinical data","patients older","Long-term studies","Predominant genotypes","large biobank of samples","respiratory tract infections","phylogenetic relatedness","genotypic relatedness","little data","clinical practice","Human adenovirus","obtained sequences","highest positivity rate","country","conjunctivitis swabs","novel insights","stool","PCR amplification","sequencing","study","diversity","HAdV1","changes","risk factors","important pathogen","hypervariable hexon gene","HAdV2","CONCLUSION","HAdV8","time","year period","BACKGROUND","Bern","PURPOSE","HAdV3","clear seasonality","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiome affects disease development. We therefore studied the effect of the nasopharyngeal microbiome on viral load and mucosal cytokine responses, two important factors influencing the pathophysiology of RSV disease. To determine the relation between (i) the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract, (ii) viral load, and (iii) host mucosal inflammation during an RSV infection, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles of RSV infected infants (\u003C 6 months) with different levels of disease severity and age-matched healthy controls were determined by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. The viral load was measured using qPCR. Nasopharyngeal CCL5, CXCL10, MMP9, IL6, and CXCL8 levels were determined with ELISA. RESULTS: Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients associates significantly to total nasopharyngeal microbiota composition. Healthy infants (n = 21) and RSV patients (n = 54) display very distinct microbial patterns, primarily characterized by a loss in commensals like Veillonella and overrepresentation of opportunistic organisms like Haemophilus and Achromobacter in RSV-infected individuals. Furthermore, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles are significantly different based on CXCL8 levels. CXCL8 is a chemokine that was previously found to be indicative for disease severity and for which we find Haemophilus abundance as the strongest predictor for CXCL8 levels. CONCLUSIONS: The nasopharyngeal microbiota in young infants with RSV infection is marked by an overrepresentation of the genus Haemophilus. We present that this bacterium is associated with viral load and mucosal CXCL8 responses, both which are involved in RSV disease pathogenesis.

In this study we aimed: (1) to determine the prevalence of RVC in healthy and diarrheic suckling piglets on US farms; and (2) to evaluate if maternal antibody (Ab) levels were associated with protection of newborn suckling piglets against RVC. There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.0002) of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows. Of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested, 76.1% were RVC RNA positive. Fecal RVC RNA was detected in significantly (p = 0.0419) higher quantities and more frequently in piglets with diarrhea compared with healthy ones (82.5 vs. 69.9%). With the exception of the historic strain Cowden (G1 genotype), field RVC strains do not replicate in cell culture, which is a major impediment for studying RVC pathogenesis and immunity. To circumvent this, we generated RVC virus-like particles (VLPs) for Cowden (G1), RV0104 (G3) and RV0143 (G6) and used them as antigens in ELISA to detect swine RVC Abs in serum and milk from the sows. Using RVC-VLP Ab ELISA we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower RVC IgA and IgG Ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters. Thus, our data suggest that insufficient lactogenic protection provided by gilts plays a key role in the development of and the increased prevalence of clinical RVC disease.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chepngeno, Juliet; Diaz, Annika; Paim, Francine C.; Saif, Linda J.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c46b51e5657b05d7af97e9006d2033353ccd9512.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6805359.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640807/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0705-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVC RNA","RVC","RVC Abs","RVC IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of RVC","RVC pathogenesis","RVC virus","Fecal RVC RNA","swine RVC Abs","RVC RNA positive","lower RVC IgA","field RVC strains","RVC-VLP Ab ELISA","increased prevalence of clinical RVC disease","nursing piglets","healthy litters","diarrheic suckling piglets","diarrheic litters","higher prevalence","protection of newborn suckling piglets","milk","gilts","healthy ones","multiparous sows","IgG Ab titers","G1 genotype","diarrheal disease","US farms","nursing piglet fecal samples","higher quantities","historic strain Cowden","insufficient lactogenic protection","levels","major impediment","VLPs","serum","significant economic losses","G3","cell culture","development","different countries","RV0104","particles","antigens","key role","RV0143","G6","humans","data","exception","maternal antibody","immunity","Rotavirus C","study"],"language":"en"},

These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain. Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade. TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists. This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-\u03BAB and type 1 interferon responses. By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates. The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-\u03BAB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat. Our findings suggest evaluation of TLR3 agonists in drug therapy.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, William M.; Nicodemus, Christopher F.; Carter, William A.; Horvath, Joseph C.; Strayer, David R.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65ee5dec67f124575f5a0f6e9e180148f9dd704e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093871.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000294401400011X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000294401400011X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL","toll receptor","activated Toll","MyD88 adapter","toxic responses","interferon responses","adaptive immune responses","transient transcription responses","essential immune responses","exception of TLR3","induction factor adapter","evaluation of TLR3 agonists","cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll","double-stranded RNA agonists","different cytosolic adapter cascade","TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist","adapter protein cascades","TLRs","NF-\u03BAB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway","non-MyD88 pathway","conserved type","proinflammatory cascade","multiplicity of transient gene transcriptions","common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products","rintatolimod","significant unexpected differences","cynomolgus monkey","regulation","rats","membrane proteins","differential response","drug therapy","mechanism","humans","primates","findings","domain"],"language":"en"},

Objective To identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoid tissue pre- and postoperatively of children undergoing adenoidectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy who were undergoing adenoidectomy, in which various respiratory viruses were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in adenoid tissue and nasopharyngeal secretions collected preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Results At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of children and 25.9% of total samples. Respiratory viruses were identified in 33.8% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and in 19.8% of postoperative secretion. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 virus. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses found, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Conclusion The virus found more frequently in all samples was rhinovirus. After removal of adenoid tissue, there was a decrease in the prevalence of the virus contained in nasopharyngeal secretion 30 days after surgery.","publish_time":"2014-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biill Primo, Osvaldo Vin\u00EDcius; Louren\u00E7o, Edmir Am\u00E9rico; Passos, Saulo Duarte","journal":"Int Arch Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8db11431c2928d45f9c7587b2fb1a9dabbd2916f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4296995.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1368135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of respiratory viruses","various respiratory viruses","prevalence of major respiratory viruses","nasopharyngeal secretions","adenoid tissue pre-","removal of adenoid tissue","lymphoid tissues","preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens","adenoidectomy","patients","children","days","rhinovirus","total samples","main agent isolated","upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy","positive results","viral agent","postoperative secretion","real-time polymerase chain reaction","oropharynx","years of age","impact","recurrent infections","nasopharynx","decrease","prospective observational study","Methods","surgery","Introduction","Objective","Conclusion","bocavirus"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the characteristics of PEx managed on an outpatient basis and the effectiveness of oral antibiotic therapy. We sought to prospectively evaluate clinical and laboratory changes associated with oral antibiotic treatment for PEx. METHODS: Children with CF between 8 and 18 years of age prescribed two weeks of oral antibiotics for a PEx were eligible to enroll. The study consisted of a visit within 48 h of starting antibiotics and a second visit within one week of antibiotic completion. Twenty-eight participants were evaluated by exacerbation score, quality of life measurements, lung function, sputum microbiology and inflammation. RESULTS: Oral antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant improvement in exacerbation score and quality of life measured by the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain. Following treatment, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) % predicted increased [median (range)] 9% (\u22128%, 31%), and 22 (81%) subjects returned to 90% or higher of baseline FEV(1). Bacterial density of the primary organism identified on sputum culture decreased significantly with a median (range) decrease of 0.8 log(10) cfu/mL (\u22128 log(10), 2 log(10,) p = 0.03).

With statistics of daytime observations during summer in Hong Kong as an example, this study demonstrates that neutral atmospheric boundary conditions occur with a very low probability, which implies that current practices are indeed far away from reality. This study is devoted to addressing this knowledge gap by cross-comparisons of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and large-eddy simulations (LES) under neutral and unstable conditions. It is found that LES-computed velocity ratios under unstable conditions are in line with field measurements, while results of simulations under neutral conditions are close to those of wind tunnel tests. Enhanced vertical mixing due to surface heating produces improved ventilation performance in the unstable case. The neutral assumption tends to underestimate pedestrian-level velocity ratios compared to a diabatic condition; hence it is deemed conservative when it is adopted in AVA practices.

We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation\u0027s population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hart, Olga E.; Halden, Rolf U.","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/365139f7c4fa3b5b5719377854b6d36df6083b07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371231/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323925?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323925","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBE"],"locations":["Detroit","New Orleans"],"keyphrases":["WBE surveillance of populations","WBE data vulnerable","infected individuals","Important limitations of WBE rest","non-infected people","asymptomatic infected case","over-estimation of infected cases","clinical screening","clinical testing","viable means of effective surveillance","pandemic","one-time national surveillance campaigns","New Orleans","community wastewater","practical limits of medical screening","temperature effects","billions of people","practical successes","New York City","emerging epidemic hotspots","number of testing rounds","wastewater-based epidemiology","global economic recovery","US dollar range","Seattle","Teheran","challenges","past","Madrid","average","Wuhan","Milan","Detroit","capita water","sewer travel time","feasibility","opportunities","detection","SARS-CoV","nation\u0027s population size","Cost savings","active coronavirus infections","modeling","economy","local conditions","magnitude cheaper","resource poor regions","nations","inability","Computer simulations","COVID","key variables","Abstract","potential tool","computational analysis","two-step process","money","focus","precision management","approach","specific locations","scientists","livelihoods","world"],"language":"en"},

This study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in PRRS results from (a) genetic variation among viral isolates and/or (b) variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found. Genetic data (open reading frame 5 gene sequences) and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 PRRS virus (PRRSV) field isolates, representing 52 farms. Clinical disease signs were interrelated \u2014 confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists (involving abortions, infertility in sows, deaths of sows and preweaning mortality). Pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations also tended to share viral isolates which were more similar to one another than expected by chance alone. This implies that sow death (one of the more-severe manifestations of PRRS) is under genetic influence. Large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs. All-in\u2013all-out management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd. All-in\u2013all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs \u2014 but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows. These results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which PRRS clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak. In general, signs associated with PRRS appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics. The relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question.","publish_time":"2000-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldberg, Tony L.; Weigel, Ronald M.; Hahn, Edwin C.; Scherba, Gail","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f78a49e121f4051e7752d2ddcd77be79d157630.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134204.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758779900104X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758779900104X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRS clinical signs","clinical disease signs","PRRS results","respiratory disease","reproductive signs","farm-management practices","PRRS virus","herd-management characteristics","deaths of sows","Genetic data","death of sows","genetic variation","high clinical variability","viral isolates","sow herd","genetic influence","severe manifestations of PRRS","specific clinical sign","respiratory syndrome","nursery pigs","field isolates","sow death","disease of domestic swine","farm characteristics","combination of genetic factors","true reproductive syndrome","question","sow populations","Pairs of farms","Large herd size","increased risk of infertility","significant risk factor","gene sequences","open reading frame","abortions","finishing stages of production","influences","PRRSV","preweaning mortality","relative contributions","study","outbreak","chance"],"language":"en"},

The unique sequence characteristics and the phylogenetic position of OAstV-2 suggest that genetically divergent lineages of astroviruses exist in sheep.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reuter, G\u00E1bor; Pankovics, P\u00E9ter; Delwart, Eric; Boros, \u00C1kos","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03830ea65b5ec04279f1b94916509d6b14fd5a64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3518301.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22033597/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1151-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hungary"],"keyphrases":["Hungary","ovine astrovirus type","novel ovine astrovirus","domestic sheep","UTR sequence","phylogenetic position of OAstV","unique sequence characteristics","fecal specimen","Ovis aries","genera","Avastrovirus","gastroenteritis","members","viral metagenomic analysis","GenBank database","divergent lineages of astroviruses","ORF1b","mammalian hosts","Mamastrovirus","ORF2","accession number JN592482","family Astroviridae","fragment","Sequencing"],"language":"en"},

While the early focus was in Asia, recent evidence suggests that Egypt is a new epicenter for the disease. This includes characterization of a variant clade 2.2.1.1, which has been found almost exclusively in Egypt. We analyzed 226 HA and 92 NA sequences with an emphasis on the H5N1 2.2.1.1 strains in Egypt using a Bayesian discrete phylogeography approach. This allowed modeling of virus dispersion between Egyptian governorates including the most likely origin. RESULTS: Phylogeography models of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) suggest Ash Sharqiyah as the origin of virus spread, however the support is weak based on Kullback\u2013Leibler values of 0.09 for HA and 0.01 for NA. Association Index (AI) values and Parsimony Scores (PS) were significant (p-value \u003C 0.05), indicating that dispersion of H5N1 in Egypt was geographically structured. In addition, the Ash Sharqiyah to Al Gharbiyah and Al Fayyum to Al Qalyubiyah routes had the strongest statistical support. CONCLUSION: We found that the majority of routes with strong statistical support were in the heavily populated Delta region. In particular, the Al Qalyubiyah governorate appears to represent a popular location for virus transition as it represented a large portion of branches in both trees. However, there remains uncertainty about virus dispersion to and from this location and thus more research needs to be conducted in order to examine this. Phylogeography can highlight the drivers of H5N1 emergence and spread. This knowledge can be used to target public health efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality. For Egypt, future work should focus on using data about vaccination and live bird markets in phylogeography models to study their impact on H5N1 diffusion within the country.","publish_time":"2013-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scotch, Matthew; Mei, Changjiang; Makonnen, Yilma J; Pinto, Julio; Ali, AbdelHakim; Vegso, Sally; Kane, Michael; Sarkar, Indra Neil; Rabinowitz, Peter","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878885.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24325606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ash Sharqiyah","Al Gharbiyah","Al Fayyum"],"organizations":["NA","Al Qalyubiyah"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["dispersion of H5N1","H5N1 diffusion","origin of virus","Al Qalyubiyah routes","modeling of virus dispersion","Al Gharbiyah","Al Fayyum","virus transition","Al Qalyubiyah governorate","Phylogeography models of hemagglutinin","drivers of H5N1 emergence","Ash Sharqiyah","strongest statistical support","strong statistical support","Bayesian discrete phylogeography approach","public health efforts","Leibler values","majority of routes","serious public health concern","popular location","NA sequences","likely origin","early focus","data","live bird markets","Egyptian governorates","Parsimony Scores","millions of birds","PS","vaccination","potential","Kullback","Asia","recent evidence","strains","neuraminidase","impact","Association Index","large portion of branches","morbidity","emphasis","new epicenter","humans","trees","mortality","populated Delta region","Influenza","future work","country","RESULTS","addition","p-value","characterization","variant clade","global pandemic","disease","research","BACKGROUND","uncertainty","order","CONCLUSION","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

It offers proposals on syllabus design, assessment and objectives by reference to the authors\u0027 own teaching experience, and also seeks to serve as a resource for those considering the introduction of a course in this field. There is consideration of the conceptual analysis of public health law, and an exploration of the obstacles and opportunities involved in teaching public health law in higher education. To date, issues of public health law have received coverage, if at all, almost exclusively in the context of existing medical or healthcare law modules. Although difficult obstacles remain to be surmounted before the subject can be fully embraced, its marginalization appears to be increasingly misplaced in light of growing awareness of the policy challenges presented by public health and the potential for law to function as a valuable tool to assist in addressing such challenges. There are also potent pedagogical arguments for the teaching of public health law on a liberal academic curriculum.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Syrett, K.; Quick, O.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a01fad236c84911b2ba7e7ba3aeb4a3b0b77436f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243797/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003335060900002X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2008.12.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003335060900002X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["teaching public health law","teaching of public health law","issues of public health law","conceptual analysis of public health law","healthcare law modules","teaching experience","liberal academic curriculum","policy challenges","difficult obstacles","distinct subject of study","reference","opportunities","assessment","objectives","case","exploration","higher education","context of existing medical","syllabus design","authors\u0027","potent pedagogical arguments","date","light of growing awareness","introduction","proposals","article","consideration","coverage","potential","valuable tool","course","field","Summary","resource","marginalization"],"language":"en"},

Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein\u2013protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.","publish_time":"2017-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Darling, Tamarand Lee; Sherwood, Laura Jo; Hayhurst, Andrew","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3855de3900dee3cecb63982884763c5dac76b8cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5623874.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021793/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01197","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","RNC","Confocal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monomeric sdAb","dimeric sdAb specific","intracellular NP","EBOV NP","dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation","NP aggregation","pools of NP","Inhibition of NP packaging","small amounts of dimeric sdAb","purified sdAb constructs","intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb","retuning sdAb specificity","conserved C-terminal regions of NP","Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers","approach of crosslinking","genus specific","viral replication","viral matrix proteins","nucleocapsid proteins","genus-specific manner","MARV","viral polymerase","virions","RNCs of Marburgvirus","conserved regions of assembly critical proteins","broad spectrum of viruses","negative strand RNA viruses","cell membranes","protein interactions","aberrant protein","replication processes","Confocal microscopy","reduced progeny of cognate virus relative","Infection of stable Vero cell lines","wild-type Vero cells","VP40-based VLPs","prime example","smaller plaques","association","genome","collective data","later time-points","core polymeric helical scaffold","crosslinkers","Filoviruses","repetition of nucleoprotein","exogenous delivery of antibody","large macromolecular repeat structures","sdAbs","assay","initial evaluation","cytosol","single-domain antibodies","ideal targets","orderly transport","impact","ease of application","Ribonucleocapsids","Ebolavirus","ambivalent partition","crosslinker design","infectious particles","stoichiometry","length","Xintrabodies"],"language":"en"},

Here the vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C6 is identified as an inhibitor of PRR-induced IFN-\u03B2 expression by a functional screen of select VACV open reading frames expressed individually in mammalian cells. C6 is a member of a family of Bcl-2-like poxvirus proteins, many of which have been shown to inhibit innate immune signalling pathways. PRRs activate both NF-\u03BAB and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) to activate the IFN-\u03B2 promoter induction. Data presented here show that C6 inhibits IRF3 activation and translocation into the nucleus, but does not inhibit NF-\u03BAB activation. C6 inhibits IRF3 and IRF7 activation downstream of the kinases TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03BAB kinase-\u03B5 (IKK\u03B5), which phosphorylate and activate these IRFs. However, C6 does not inhibit TBK1- and IKK\u03B5-independent IRF7 activation or the induction of promoters by constitutively active forms of IRF3 or IRF7, indicating that C6 acts at the level of the TBK1/IKK\u03B5 complex. Consistent with this notion, C6 immunoprecipitated with the TBK1 complex scaffold proteins TANK, SINTBAD and NAP1. C6 is expressed early during infection and is present in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Mutant viruses in which the C6L gene is deleted, or mutated so that the C6 protein is not expressed, replicated normally in cell culture but were attenuated in two in vivo models of infection compared to wild type and revertant controls. Thus C6 contributes to VACV virulence and might do so via the inhibition of PRR-induced activation of IRF3 and IRF7.","publish_time":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Unterholzner, Leonie; Sumner, Rebecca P.; Baran, Marcin; Ren, Hongwei; Mansur, Daniel S.; Bourke, Nollaig M.; Randow, Felix; Smith, Geoffrey L.; Bowie, Andrew G.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ad4571111757c52a7c4004a6cc1a9e3698a09f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3169548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21931555/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002247","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein C6","C6 protein","C6 acts","IRF3 activation","induced activation of IRF3","IKK\u03B5-independent IRF7 activation","IFN-\u03B2 promoter induction","NF-\u03BAB activation","induced IFN-\u03B2 expression","interferon-\u03B2","IKK\u03B5 complex","TBK1 complex scaffold proteins TANK","induction of promoters","IFN regulatory factors","Recognition of viruses","active forms of IRF3","PRRs","nucleus","VACV virulence","IRFs","anti-viral innate immune response","target of viral immune evasion","innate immune signalling pathways","kinases TANK binding kinase","VACV open reading frames","inhibitor of PRR","inhibition of PRR","Mutant viruses","models of infection","poxvirus proteins","pattern recognition receptors","I\u03BAB kinase-\u03B5","functional screen","key event","SINTBAD","wild type","level","NAP1","vaccinia virus","translocation","mammalian cells","revertant controls","family of Bcl","C6L gene","member","notion","cytoplasm","cell culture","Data"],"language":"en"},

Despite the wide availability of vaccines, there are multiple problems decreasing the effectiveness of vaccination programs. These include viral variability and hence the requirement to match strains by estimating which will become prevalent each season, problems associated with vaccine and adjuvant production, and the route of administration as well as the perceived lower vaccine efficiency in older adults. Clinical protection is still suboptimal for all of these reasons, and vaccine uptake remains too low in most countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly. This commentary assesses progress over the last 3 years towards achieving these aims. Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage. And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawelec, Graham; McElhaney, Janet","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc2e1459e6af042a520cfd46845a69f9767fc604.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22611.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of influenza vaccines","effective vaccines","Seasonal influenza","wide availability of vaccines","developing universal vaccines independent","vaccine uptake","Efforts","new coronavirus SARS-CoV","circulating strains","multiple problems","perceived lower vaccine efficiency","particular season","elderly people","effectiveness of vaccination programs","major public health problem","hundreds of thousands","industrial effort","deaths","older adults","adjuvant production","route of administration","requirement","humoral responses","reasons","crucial importance","pandemic","progress","years","Clinical protection","viral variability","countries","beginning","attention","mutual advantage","commentary","aims","lessons"],"language":"en"},

The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-qaness, Mohammed A.

To examine the prevalence of Korean cats infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) type I and II, fecal samples were obtained from 212 cats (107 pet and 105 feral) in 2009. RESULTS: Fourteen cats were FCoV-positive, including infections with type I FCoV (n = 8), type II FCoV (n = 4), and types I and II co-infection (n = 2). Low seroprevalences (13.7%, 29/212) of FCoV were identified in chronically ill cats (19.3%, 16/83) and healthy cats (10.1%, 13/129). CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of FCoV infection was not high in comparison to other countries, there was a higher prevalence of type I FCoV in Korean felines. The prevalence of FCoV antigen and antibody in Korean cats are expected to gradually increase due to the rising numbers of stray and companion cats.","publish_time":"2011-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Dong-Jun; Jeoung, Hye-Young; Jeong, WooSeog; Park, Jee-Yong; Lee, Myoung-Heon; Park, Bong-Kyun","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/704a894ab79031263de39fc49d954f7d13aa1bf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219666.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21951835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of FCoV infection","prevalence of Korean cats","FCoV-positive","prevalence of FCoV antigen","companion cats","ill cats","healthy cats","Feline coronavirus","higher prevalence of type","feline enteric coronavirus","Korean felines","feline infectious peritonitis virus","co-infection","FIPV","pathogenic biotypes","antibody","infections","countries","rising numbers of stray","comparison","FECV","fecal samples","pet","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Low seroprevalences","serotypes"],"language":"en"},

Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible as 293T cells, suggesting that cellular factors enhance the mNDK infection in 293T cells. By screening a cDNA expression library in HeLa cells, cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the mNDK infection. Because cathepsin B protease, a natural ligand of cystatin C, was upregulated in HeLa cells, we speculated that the high levels of cathepsin B activities were inhibitory to the CD4-independent infection and that cystatin C enhanced the infection by impairing the excessive cathepsin B activity. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of HeLa cells with 125 \u00B5M of CA-074Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, resulted in an 8-fold enhancement of the mNDK infectivity. Because cathepsin B is activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, we further examined the potential roles of endosomes in the CD4-independent infection. Suppression of endosome acidification or endocytosis by inhibitors or by an Eps15 dominant negative mutant reduced the infectivity of mNDK in which CD4-dependent infections were not significantly impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and cathepsin B activity are involved in the CD4-independent entry of HIV-1.","publish_time":"2011-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshii, Hiroaki; Kamiyama, Haruka; Goto, Kensuke; Oishi, Kazunori; Katunuma, Nobuhiko; Tanaka, Yuetsu; Hayashi, Hideki; Matsuyama, Toshifumi; Sato, Hironori; Yamamoto, Naoki; Kubo, Yoshinao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b92fda04723ae9d30a58f10b054cc1b7971e870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3081840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541353/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HeLa"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","pretreatment of HeLa cells","mNDK infection","TE671 cells","Hybridoma cells","CD4-independent infection","cathepsin B protease","cathepsin B inhibitor","infectivity of mNDK","mNDK infectivity","excessive cathepsin B activity","CD4-independent entry of HIV","high levels of cathepsin B activities","CD4-dependent infections","CD4-independent human immunodeficiency virus type","natural ligand of cystatin C","endocytosis","endosomal acidification","acidic endosomes","Suppression of endosome acidification","potential roles of endosomes","inhibitors","Eps15 dominant negative mutant","low pH","cDNA expression library","cellular factors","strain","various cell lines","idea","\u00B5M of CA","enhancer","results","fold enhancement","comparison"],"language":"en"},

The condition is a major contributor to the global disease burden and is associated with a significant economic cost. The disease is common in children aged \u003C5 years. It occurs as the result of exposure to a diarrheogenic agent that alters intestinal absorption and/or secretion, resulting in an increase in the volume of water that enters the colon beyond that which can be absorbed. Diarrhea almost always occurs by one or more of four mechanisms: disruption of osmotic forces in the intestine; disruption of normal secretory processes; disruption of epithelial cells or the epithelial tight junctions; or motility disorders. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is central to the management of acute diarrhea, and is sufficient to prevent complications due to dehydration in most patients while the disease runs its course. However, ORT has no effect on the duration of the disease or frequency of bowel motions, and any agent that could meet these needs would therefore be a useful addition to ORT. Diosmectite is a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay with a lamellar, non-fibrous crystalline structure that gives it strong adsorbent properties. Its mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood, but are probably multiple. Diosmectite reduces inflammation, modifies mucus rheologic properties, inhibits mucolysis, and adsorbs bacteria, bacterial enterotoxins, viruses and other potentially diarrheogenic substances. A number of studies have shown that diosmectite reduces the duration of diarrhea and decreases the frequency of bowel motions after 2 days of treatment in children with mild-to-moderate acute diarrhea. Two recent trials have indicated a reduction in stool output with diosmectite. Because of its very favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse effects, diosmectite is frequently used, mainly in European countries but also in Asia and Africa. Diosmectite should be used as an adjunct, not an alternative, to ORT and, when needed, to antibacterial therapy.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dupont, Christophe; Vernisse, Bernard","journal":"Paediatr Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b3004c9a1c9e47851902124d45081862b27f3b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301931/; https://doi.org/10.2165/00148581-200911020-00001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORT"],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["Diosmectite","ORT","duration of diarrhea","moderate acute diarrhea","management of acute diarrhea","disruption of epithelial cells","frequency of bowel motions","diarrheogenic agent","global disease burden","children","disruption of osmotic forces","disruption of normal secretory processes","diarrheogenic substances","developing countries","European countries","antibacterial therapy","mechanisms of action","epithelial tight junctions","mucus rheologic properties","strong adsorbent properties","Oral rehydration therapy","intestine","non-fibrous crystalline structure","natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay","days of treatment","viruses","mucolysis","major contributor","reduction","serious adverse effects","favorable safety profile","bacterial enterotoxins","motility disorders","patients","dehydration","intestinal absorption","inflammation","infectious organism","stool output","volume of water","increase","secretion","complications","Asia","needs","useful addition","result of exposure","recent trials","significant economic cost","colon","condition","Africa","years","alternative","course","adjunct","number of studies"],"language":"en"},

In these cells, the interferon-\u03B2, interferon regulatory factor 3, and nuclear factor-\u03BAB activities were suppressed compared to those of parental cells, suggesting that nsp11 might serve as a viral interferon antagonist. Differential cellular transcriptome was examined using Affymetrix exon chips representing 28,536 transcripts, and after statistical analyses 66 cellular genes were shown to be upregulated and 104 genes were downregulated by nsp11. These genes were grouped into 5 major signaling pathways according to their functional relations: histone-related, cell cycle and DNA replication, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling, complement, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Of these, the modulation of cell cycle by nsp11 was further investigated since many of the regulated genes fell in this particular pathway.

Since sampling of blood requires medically trained personal and comprises some risks for the patient as well as for the health care personal, the sampling by non-invasive methods (e.g. saliva and/ or urine) might be a very valuable alternative for investigating a diseased patient. MAIN BODY: To analyse the usefulness of alternative non\u00ADinvasive samples for the diagnosis of emerging infectious viral diseases, a literature search was performed on PubMed for alternative sampling for these viral infections. In total, 711 papers of potential relevance were found, of which we have included 128 in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the experience using non-invasive sampling for the diagnostic of emerging viral diseases, it seems important to perform an investigation using alternative samples for routine diagnostics. Moreover, during an outbreak situation, evaluation of appropriate sampling and further processing for laboratory analysis on various diagnostic platforms are very crucial. This will help to achieve optimal diagnostic results for a good and reliable case identification.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system. Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19 and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS: Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care. In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030) and history of sick contact (p-values\u003C0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Patients on B-cell depleting antibodies had 3.6 times higher risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group as compared to patients on none-lymphocyte-depleting and non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs (95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The course of infection in MS patients suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.

Based on engineering control method (Aerosol Science and Technology 31 (1999) 249; 35 (2001) 852), which was previously applied to the removal of particles from gas carriers, a new personal bioaerosol sampler has been developed. Contaminated air is bubbled through porous medium submerged into liquid and subsequently split into multitude of very small bubbles. The particulates are scavenged by these bubbles, and, thus, effectively removed. The current study explores its feasibility for monitoring of viable airborne SARS virus. It was found that the natural decay of such virus in the collection fluid was around 0.75 and 1.76lg during 2 and 4h of continuous operation, respectively. Theoretical microbial recovery rates of higher than 55 and 19% were calculated for 1 and 2h of operation, respectively.

In the present study, we generated neutralization-escape mutants, using 6 different monoclonal antibodies, and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness.

In these situations, the wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saraereh, Omar A; Alsaraira, Amer; Khan, Imran; Uthansakul, Peerapong","journal":"Sensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340268/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082396","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LoRa"],"organizations":["BS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ground-based LoRa nodes","UAV-enabled LoRa architecture","UAV-enabled LoRa network","mobile nodes","UAV topology","packet reception rate","UAVs act","traffic","messages","BS","decoding errors","distributed topology control algorithm","remote environments","proposed approach","WiFi network","movement prediction technique","remote base station","average delay quality of service","forests","virtual spring forces","large distance","COVID","traditional communications","suburban areas","QoS","mountains","feasibility","nominal buffer delays","Long Range","Corona Virus","intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","key tool","relays","wireless networks","conventional approaches","fixed gateways","metrics","reliability","simulation results","flood","disaster","situations","battle","mechanisms","surface","earthquake","rescuers"],"language":"en"},

Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil. RESULTS: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97 %), canine distemper virus (15 %) and canine adenovirus (27 %) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus. Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks. Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households. Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected. CONCLUSIONS: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog\u2019s movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance. Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary. The study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of Atlantic Forest\u2019s wild carnivores.","publish_time":"2016-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curi, Nelson Henrique de Almeida; Massara, Rodrigo Lima; de Oliveira Paschoal, Ana Maria; Soriano-Ara\u00FAjo, Amanda; Lobato, Z\u00E9lia In\u00EAs Portela; Dem\u00E9trio, Guilherme Ramos; Chiarello, Adriano Garcia; Passamani, Marcelo","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb856c32c1a41e6513729e126e84e639ce4f5a68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4730773.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0646-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822375/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Atlantic","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["pathogen exposure of dogs","behaviour of dogs","health of rural dogs","canine parvovirus","canine distemper virus","viral pathogen exposure","Widespread exposure","canine adenovirus","canine coronavirus","important viral diseases of rural dogs","crucial role of domestic dogs","environment-associated risk factors","households","Atlantic Forest\u2019s wild carnivores","threatening diseases","dog sex","dog vaccination","wildlife interfaces","lack of health care","Atlantic Forest fragments","nearby forests","sterilization","inhibiting dog\u2019s movements","access","population control","questionnaire survey","villages","protected areas","reservoirs","preventive management actions","small private reserves","number of people","cross-sectional serological approach","study","support","prevalence","southeast Brazil","zoonosis","larger state parks","associations","RESULTS","human","veterinary assistance","epidemiological features","parvovirosis","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle.

Ligands of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein that we have predicted in the present computational investigation, might be the basis for new experimental studies in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bongini, Pietro; Trezza, Alfonso; Bianchini, Monica; Spiga, Ottavia; Niccolai, Neri","journal":"Biochem Biophys Res Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ad9b7992f37afd377076317f9e5f56d19937c8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144664.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2030704X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X2030704X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quaternary spike glycoprotein formation","protomer-protomer interfaces","Ligands of COVID","recent release of COVID","trimeric structure of COVID","single protomer surfaces","quaternary assembly","druggable pockets","Drug Bank","detailed analysis","basis","binding","concave moieties","available drugs","structural features","new experimental studies","infective form","present computational investigation","additional strategy","deadly virus","presence","life cycle","approach"],"language":"en"},

For most patients, the illness is a self-limited one. Its major risk is dehydration. However, for some patients, diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration or be associated with bacteremia and metastatic infection. Patients with these conditions require prompt treatment. A large number of organisms have been associated with diarrhea in humans, and most laboratories routinely screen for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Other bacteria, parasites, and viruses account for a significant percentage of diarrhea cases and frequently go undetected. This article summarizes many of these pathogens and describes the settings in which they can be acquired. Food distribution networks have made the delivery of previously rare foods to remote areas a commonplace occurrence; this has also led to new challenges in the diagnosis and prevention of food-borne illnesses. Outbreaks of diarrhea now frequently extend across many states. The identification of a rare strain of a bacterial pathogen or changes in the isolation rate of common pathogens may be early clues to the cause of such an ongoing outbreak. Most enteric pathogens cause disease by either stimulating the secretion of fluids at the level of the small bowel or by irritating and invading the colon. Organisms that cause disease by the latter mechanism have the potential to invade the blood stream and spread to other parts of the body, including the bones and the central nervous system. Several organisms have been associated with specific postinfectious syndromes that are responsible for additional morbidity and mortality. The antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has been increasing, and this has a limiting effect on the empiric treatment choices available for suspected bacterial diarrhea. Careful attention to local sensitivity patterns and appropriate testing of the patient\u0027s isolate are among the important factors that lead to successful treatment decisions.","publish_time":"1999-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodman, Larry; Segreti, John","journal":"Disease-a-Month","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf936d1f9760d4c79afd790138c20e4ebeb25167.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011502999900007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0011502999900007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Outbreaks of diarrhea","suspected bacterial diarrhea","patients","Abstract Infectious diarrhea","enteric pathogens cause disease","significant percentage of diarrhea cases","antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens","common illness","isolation rate of common pathogens","prompt treatment","successful treatment decisions","large number of organisms","empiric treatment choices available","rare foods","rare strain","prevention of food","severe dehydration","Food distribution networks","appropriate testing","local sensitivity patterns","delivery","changes","patient\u0027s isolate","remote areas","viruses account","important factors","specific postinfectious syndromes","additional morbidity","Careful attention","commonplace occurrence","limiting effect","early clues","bones","level","bacteremia","diagnosis","laboratories","secretion of fluids","parts","potential","blood stream","Salmonella","Shigella","central nervous system","new challenges","parasites","mortality","millions of Americans","conditions","small bowel","Campylobacter","metastatic infection","body","major risk","mechanism","illnesses","identification","ongoing outbreak","humans","article","settings","states","colon"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, VP patients were less likely to have received influenza vaccination. VP patients had a systemic inflammation response involving IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and MCP-1 which may be due to virus-induced activation of macrophages.

Also to cogitate on the very high risk of viral spread spread by the use of surgical diathermy in COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed using the keywords surgical smoke, diathermy, electrocautery, surgical smoke hazards, smoke evacuator, and guidelines for surgical smoke safety was performed. The review included evidences from 50 articles from the dermatology, surgery, infectious disease, obstetrics, and cancer biology literature. Results There are risks associated with surgical smoke. Although some surgeons were aware, majority were not keen in the hazard reduction strategies. Conclusion Many chemical and biological particles have been found in surgical smoke. It is highly recommended to follow the standardised guidelines for surgical smoke safety. Surgical smoke carries full virus particle(such as COVID-19 virus), it is strongly recommended to minimise or avoid electrocautery during the COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karuppal, Raju; Surendran, Sibin; Patinharayil, Gopinathan; Muhammed Fazil, V.

Protein deimination causes generation of neo-epitopes, affects gene regulation and also allows for protein moonlighting. Furthermore, PADs have been found to be a phylogenetically conserved regulator for extracellular vesicle (EVs) release. EVs are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins in serum and serum-EVs are described for the first time in camelids, using the llama (Lama glama L. 1758) as a model animal. We report a poly-dispersed population of llama serum EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In serum, 103 deiminated proteins were overall identified, including key immune and metabolic mediators including complement components, immunoglobulin-based nanobodies, adiponectin and heat shock proteins. In serum, 60 deiminated proteins were identified that were not in EVs, and 25 deiminated proteins were found to be unique to EVs, with 43 shared deiminated protein hits between both serum and EVs. Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, was also detected in llama serum. PAD homologues were identified in llama serum by Western blotting, via cross reaction with human PAD antibodies, and detected at an expected 70 kDa size. This is the first report of deiminated proteins in serum and EVs of a camelid species, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized post-translational modification in key immune and metabolic proteins in camelids, which may be translatable to and inform a range of human metabolic and inflammatory pathologies.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Criscitiello, Michael F.; Kraev, Igor; Lange, Sigrun","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b90c0ff9f6c2d16eed507a2ff051f6f27fec1006.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733447/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019304833; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019304833; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.10.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum-EVs","metabolic proteins","report of deiminated proteins","target proteins","transfer of cargo proteins","heat shock proteins","poly-dispersed population of llama serum EVs","shared deiminated protein hits","Deiminated histone H3","metabolic mediators","range of human metabolic","conserved regulator","Protein deimination","camelids","protein moonlighting","PADs","human PAD antibodies","unrecognized post-translational modification","conserved calcium-dependent enzymes","conserved EV-specific markers","extracellular vesicle","PAD homologues","marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation","complement components","immunoglobulin-based nanobodies","cross reaction","cellular communication","adiponectin","irreversible manner","generation of neo-epitopes","structural changes","Western blotting","gene regulation","citrulline","camelid species","inflammatory pathologies","body fluids","genetic material","Abstract Peptidylarginine deiminases","Lama glama","release","time","study","kDa size","TEM","model animal"],"language":"en"},

Here we review the evidence for the significance of variation in genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) for conservation efforts. MHC molecules present pathogen-derived antigens to the effector cells of the immune system and thus trigger the adaptive immune response. Some MHC genes are the most variable functional genes in the vertebrate genome. Their variation is clearly of adaptive significance and there is considerable evidence that its maintenance is mainly due to balancing selection imposed by pathogens. However, while the evidence for selection shaping MHC variation on the historical timescale is compelling, a correlation between levels of MHC variation and variation at neutral loci is often observed, indicating that on a shorter timescale drift also substantially affects MHC, leading to depletion of MHC diversity. The evidence that the loss of MHC variation negatively affects population survival is so far equivocal and difficult to separate from effects of general inbreeding. Some species with depleted MHC variation seem to be particularly susceptible to infection, but other species thrive and expand following severe bottlenecks that have drastically limited their MHC variation. However, while the latter demonstrate that MHC variation is not always critical for population survival, these species may in fact represent rare examples of survival despite of the loss of MHC variation. There is clearly a compelling need for data that would disclose the possible consequences of MHC diversity for population viability. In particular, we need more data on the impact of MHC allelic richness on the abundance of parasites or prevalence of disease in populations, while controlling for the role of general inbreeding. Before such evidence accumulates, captive breeding programs and other conservation measures aimed at inbreeding avoidance should be favoured over those protecting only MHC variation, especially since inbreeding avoidance programs would usually conserve both types of genetic diversity simultaneously.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radwan, Jacek; Biedrzycka, Aleksandra; Babik, Wies\u0142aw","journal":"Biological Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02016f5da58f97adbf8d99660991cd31c9fc0564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092871.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709003395; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226082/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320709003395","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Major Histocompatibility Complex","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loss of MHC variation","levels of MHC variation","depleted MHC variation","MHC genes","depletion of variation","significance of variation","depletion of MHC diversity","possible consequences of MHC diversity","Abstract Loss of genetic variation","impact of MHC allelic richness","inbreeding avoidance","MHC molecules present pathogen-derived antigens","population survival","species","considerable evidence","inbreeding depression","effects of general inbreeding","role of general inbreeding","genes responsible","variable functional genes","populations","population viability","data","avoidance programs","adaptive significance","pathogens","types of genetic diversity","compelling need","adaptive immune response","rare examples of survival despite","conservation measures","abundance of parasites","historical timescale","conservation efforts","immune system","balancing selection","captive breeding programs","shorter timescale drift","fact","correlation","effector cells","Major Histocompatibility Complex","vertebrate genome","prevalence of disease","maintenance","immunity","neutral loci","severe bottlenecks","infection"],"language":"en"},

Sixty-one pathogenic E. coli strains and Salmonella spp. (n = 24) strains isolated from fecal samples of calves and Salmonella spp. (n = 39) strains previously isolated from fecal samples of growing/finishing pigs were tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the agar dilution method was determined for nalidixic acid, amikacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefoxitin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to amikacin. Tetracycline was the antimicrobial that presented the higher frequency of resistance among E. coli strains, followed by ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and cefoxitin. E. coli (n = 61) strains isolated from calves belonged to different phylogroup namely, phylogroup A (n = 26), phylogroup B1 (n = 31), phylogroup E (n = 3), and phylogroup F (n = 1). Phylogroups B2, C, and D were not identified among the E. coli in the present study. All Salmonella spp. (n = 24) strains isolated from fecal samples of calves were susceptible to amikacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to nalidixic acid and cefoxitin was detected in 16.66 and 8.33 % of the Salmonella spp. strains, respectively. Among the Salmonella spp. (n = 39) strains isolated from fecal samples of pigs, the higher frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline, followed by amoxicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, cefoxitin, and norfloxacin. All strains were susceptible to amikacin. Forty-eight (78.68 %) of the E. coli strains were classified as multidrug-resistant, whereas among Salmonella spp. strains, the percentage of multidrug resistance was 57.14 %, being all multidrug-resistant strains isolated from pigs (92.30 %). The results from the present study indicate a high frequency of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from calves and Salmonella spp. strains isolated from pigs and a high rate of susceptibility to most antimicrobials tested among Salmonella spp. strains isolated from calves.

In 2007, in the first reported outbreak in Australia, the virus spread through the horse populations of two states within 4 months. Most of the geographic spread occurred within the first 10 days and was associated with the movement of infected horses prior to the implementation of movement controls. This study applies social network analysis to describe spread of equine influenza between horse premises infected in the early outbreak period, identifying spread occurring through a contact network and secondary local spatial spread. Social networks were constructed by combining contact-tracing data on horse movements with a distance matrix between all premises holding horses infected within the first 10 days of the outbreak. These networks were analysed to provide a description of the epidemic, identify premises that were central to disease spread and to estimate the relative proportion of premises infected through infected horse movements and through local spatial spread. We then explored the effect of distance on disease spread by estimating the range of local spread (through direct contact, transmission on fomites and windborne transmission) based on the level of fragmentation in the network and also by directly estimating the shape of the outbreak\u0027s spatial transmission kernel. During the first 10 days of this epidemic, 197 horse premises were infected; 70 of these were included in the contact-traced network. Most local spread occurred within 5km. Local spread was estimated to have occurred up to a distance of 15.3km \u2013 based on the contact-and-proximity network \u2013 and at a very low incidence beyond this distance based on the transmission kernel estimate. Of the 70 premises in the contact network, spread to 14 premises (95% CI: 9, 20 premises) was likely to have occurred through local spatial spread from nearby infected premises, suggesting that 28.3% of spread in the early epidemic period was \u2018network-associated\u2019 (95% CI: 25.6, 31.0%). By constructing a \u2018maximal network\u2019 of contact and proximity (based on a distance cut-off of 15.3km), 44 spatial clusters were described, and the horse movements that initiated infection in these locations were identified. Characteristics of the combined network, incorporating both spatial and underlying contact relationships between infected premises, explained the high rate of spread, the sequence of cluster formation and the widespread dispersal experienced in the early phase of this epidemic. These results can inform outbreak control planning by guiding the imposition of appropriate control zone diameters around infected premises and the targeting of surveillance and interventions.","publish_time":"2012-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firestone, Simon M.; Christley, Robert M.; Ward, Michael P.; Dhand, Navneet K.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc208b6f443ae749c929c54962591c67600ab5ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126086.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587712000384; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587712000384; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.01.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22365721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["infected premises","horse premises","contact network","spread occurring","geographic spread","range of local spread","secondary local spatial spread","spread of equine influenza","infected horse movements","contact-traced network","high rate of spread","proximity network","combined network","maximal network","movement of infected horses","direct contact","relative proportion of premises","social network analysis","horse populations","spatial clusters","underlying contact relationships","contact-tracing data","outbreak\u0027s spatial transmission kernel","early outbreak period","early epidemic period","distance matrix","distance cut-off","effect of distance","days","transmission kernel estimate","windborne transmission","reported outbreak","outbreak control planning","widespread viral respiratory disease of horses","early phase","Social networks","Abstract Equine influenza","widespread dispersal","implementation of movement controls","imposition of appropriate control zone diameters","sequence of cluster formation","fever","virus","fomites","equid species","targeting of surveillance","shape","harsh dry cough","Australia","states","results","level of fragmentation","study","infection","description","low incidence","months","interventions","locations","Characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Diarrhoea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves; therefore, we investigated whether the presence of AstV is associated with calf diarrhoea. We identified diverse AstV lineages from faecal samples of both healthy and diarrhoeic calves and healthy adult cattle in South West Scotland. AstV was common in calves (present in 74% (85/115) of samples) but uncommon in adult cattle (present in 15% (3/20) of samples). No association was found between the presence of AstV and calf diarrhoea or the presence of a specific AstV lineage and calf diarrhoea. AstV was strongly associated with the presence of rotavirus Group A (RVA), and a protective effect of age was evident for both AstV and RVA. Co-infections with multiple AstV lineages were detected in several calves and serial infection with different viruses could also be seen by longitudinal sampling of individuals. In summary, our study found genotypically diverse AstV in the faeces of calves in South West Scotland. However, no association was identified between AstV and calf diarrhoea, which suggests the virus does not play a primary role in the aetiology of calf diarrhoea in the group studied.","publish_time":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharp, Colin P.; Gregory, William F.; Mason, Colin; Bronsvoort, Barend M. deC; Beard, Philippa M.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e516c15fa2d7b43e35cf03bb6f0488854f085b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4464496.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515001868; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25979841/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515001868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of AstV","diverse AstV lineages","multiple AstV lineages","specific AstV lineage","aetiology of calf diarrhoea","diarrhoeic calves","faeces of calves","major causes of infant diarrhoea","presence of rotavirus Group","healthy adult cattle","South West Scotland","faecal samples","RVA","present","association","different viruses","positive-sense RNA viruses","important cause of morbidity","primary role","protective effect of age","mortality","serial infection","Co-infections","Abstract Astroviruses","study","longitudinal sampling of individuals","summary"],"language":"en"},

A number of challenges impede the development of these therapeutic approaches such as safety issues related to the administration of whole pathogens whether attenuated or inactivated. One safe alternative to classical vaccination methods gaining recognition is the use of nanoparticles, whether synthetic or naturally derived. We have recently demonstrated that the papaya mosaic virus (PapMV)-like nanoparticle can be used as a prophylactic vaccine against various viral and bacterial infections through the induction of protective humoral and cellular immune responses. Moreover, PapMV is also very efficient when used as an immune adjuvant in an immunotherapeutic setting at slowing down the growth of aggressive mouse melanoma tumors in a type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent manner. In the present study, we were interested in exploiting the capacity of PapMV of inducing robust IFN-I production as treatment for the chronic viral infection model lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 (Cl13). Treatment of LCMV Cl13-infected mice with two systemic administrations of PapMV was ineffective, as shown by the lack of changes in viral titers and immune response to LCMV following treatment. Moreover, IFN-\u03B1 production following PapMV administration was almost completely abolished in LCMV-infected mice. To better isolate the mechanisms at play, we determined the influence of a pretreatment with PapMV on secondary PapMV administration, therefore eliminating potential variables emanating from the infection. Pretreatment with PapMV led to the same outcome as an LCMV infection in that IFN-\u03B1 production following secondary PapMV immunization was abrogated for up to 50 days while immune activation was also dramatically impaired. We showed that two distinct and overlapping mechanisms were responsible for this outcome. While short-term inhibition was partially the result of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 degradation, a crucial component of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway, long-term inhibition was mainly due to interference by PapMV-specific antibodies. Thus, we identified a possible pitfall in the use of virus-like particles for the systemic treatment of chronic viral infections and discuss mitigating alternatives to circumvent these potential problems.","publish_time":"2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chartrand, Karine; Lebel, Marie-\u00C8ve; Tarrab, Esther; Savard, Pierre; Leclerc, Denis; Lamarre, Alain","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28d395784208073fa0bd75540cfed74a2018061d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5758502.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["capacity of PapMV","secondary PapMV administration","systemic administrations of PapMV","secondary PapMV immunization","LCMV infection","PapMV-specific antibodies","systemic treatment of chronic viral infections","IFN-\u03B1 production","LCMV-infected mice","Treatment of LCMV Cl13-infected mice","viral titers","use of virus","robust IFN","immune adjuvant","immune activation","chronic viral infection model lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","bacterial infections","cellular immune responses","pretreatment","outcome","mechanisms","papaya mosaic virus","therapeutic approaches","use of nanoparticles","potential variables","long-term inhibition","potential problems","short-term inhibition","receptor-associated kinase","classical vaccination methods","generation of therapeutic vaccines","induction of protective humoral","type","recognition","mitigating alternatives","growth of aggressive mouse melanoma tumors","crucial component","immunotherapies","degradation","prophylactic vaccine","interference","clone","safe alternative","result of interleukin","lack of changes","development","toll","immunotherapeutic setting","interferon","pathway","century","safety issues","work","pathogens","effective way","possible pitfall","influence","number of challenges","progress","play","days","dependent manner","present study"],"language":"en"},

The present study examined patterns and predictors for EOL care intensity among elderly patients with CKD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database. A total of 65,124 CKD patients aged \u2265 60 years, who died in hospitals or shortly after discharge between 2002 and 2012 were analyzed. The primary outcomes were inpatient expenses and use of surgical interventions in the last 30 days of life. Utilization of intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and dialysis was also examined in a sub-sample of 2072 patients with detailed prescription data. Multivariate log-linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess patient-, physician-, and facility-specific predictors and the potential impact of a 2009 payment policy to reimburse hospice care for non-cancer patients. RESULTS: During the last 30 days of life, average inpatients costs for elderly CKD patients were approximately US$10,260, with 40.9% receiving surgical interventions, 40.2% experiencing ICU admission, 45.3% undergoing mechanical ventilation, 14.7% receiving resuscitation and 42.0% receiving dialysis. Significant variability was observed in the inpatient costs and use of intensive services. Costs were lower among individuals with the following characteristics: advanced age; high income; high Charlson Comorbidity Index scores; treatment by older physicians, nephrologists, and family medicine physicians; and treatment at local hospitals. Similar findings were obtained for the use of surgical interventions and other intensive services. A declining trend was detected in the costs of EOL care, use of surgical interventions and resuscitation between 2009 and 2012, which is consistent with the impact of a 2009 NHI payment policy to reimburse non-cancer hospice care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall EOL costs and rates of intensive service use among older patients with CKD were high, with significant variability across various patient and provider characteristics. Several opportunities exist for providers and policy makers to reduce costs and enhance the value of EOL care for this population.","publish_time":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Bradley; Fan, Victoria Y.; Chou, Yiing-Jenq; Kuo, Chin-Chi","journal":"BMC Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce6f81a5f2e09ff7a23ea939e3c3c062ef6130c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5267416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28122500/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-017-0456-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EOL","CKD","Research Database","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["costs of EOL care","intensity of EOL care","EOL care intensity","value of EOL care","elderly CKD patients","Overall EOL costs","older patients","elderly patients","inpatient costs","use of surgical interventions","non-cancer patients","non-cancer hospice care","Utilization of intensive care unit","average inpatients costs","intensive services","resuscitation","rates of intensive service use","days of life","NHI payment policy","high income","older physicians","treatment","policy makers","mechanical ventilation","Significant variability","population","dialysis","following characteristics","provider characteristics","potential impact","inpatient expenses","ICU admission","present study","various patient","local hospitals","high Charlson Comorbidity Index scores","family medicine physicians","facility-specific predictors","retrospective nationwide cohort study","Taiwan National Health Insurance","advanced age","nephrologists","patterns","logistic regression analyses","chronic kidney disease","individuals","Multivariate log-linear","Research Database","detailed prescription data","sub-sample","providers","CONCLUSIONS","limited knowledge","urgent need","evidence","primary outcomes","opportunities","years","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Similar findings","declining trend","total","discharge","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Each patient was evaluated on the basis of the lesion volume on MRI at every follow-up for further comparisons. At the first MRI scan, the mean lesion volume was 10.12 \u00B1 8.05 cm(3) (range: 0.39\u201341.62 cm(3)). At the mid-term follow-up (2.5 years), the mean lesion volume was 7.82 \u00B1 7.59 cm(3) (range: 0.11\u201339.65 cm(3)). At the final follow-up (five years), complete regression of the lesion was observed in six hips, and the mean lesion volume was 5.67 \u00B1 6.58 cm(3) (range: 0.00\u201331.47 cm(3)). Overall, the lesion volume was reduced by \u003E15% in 80 hips, and only four hips with relatively larger lesion volumes showed no apparent reductions. The reduction in lesion size of ONFH observed on MRI is a slow, discontinuous and time-dependent process.","publish_time":"2009-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Feng-chao; Li, Zi-rong; Zhang, Nian-fei; Wang, Bai-liang; Sun, Wei; Cheng, Li-ming; Liu, Zhao-hui","journal":"International Orthopaedics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/356cb25a846e41b2001aa8e0f083f8f9850a044d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2989007.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-009-0829-7; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2989007?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19533123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osteonecrosis"],"organizations":["ONFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean lesion volume","lesion size of ONFH","lesion size changes of ONFH","larger lesion volumes","MRI scan","MRI follow-ups","hips","range","SARS patients","years","early-stage ONFH","mid-term follow-up","final follow-up","operative treatment","study","time-dependent process","corticosteroid administration","severe acute respiratory syndrome","magnetic resonance imaging","apparent reductions","basis","complete regression","Osteonecrosis","femoral head","comparisons","intractable diseases"],"language":"en"},

Seven, 5-weeks-old New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits chosen at random from 35 ill animals that were remitted for postmortem, histopathology, and ultrastructural examinations were studied. Bacteriological and parasitological studies were carried out in three additional ill rabbits of same age. In a field trail 45, 5-weeks-old apparently healthy NZW rabbits were observed daily for sanitary status for a 5-week period. Some of the rabbits did not response to the preventive drug treatment and were therefore, used to study the development of the disease. Clinical signs, gross lesions, and mortality throughout the fattening period were recorded. Eight, 8-weeks-old NZW rabbits who survived an outbreak were assessed for gamma-globulins in serum of the total protein fraction during a 3-week period. Gamma-globulins were also measured in eight free-disease healthy rabbits of same breed and age. Lesions of the small intestine consisted of mucoid enteropathy, lymphocytic plasmocytic enteritis with atrophy and fusion of villi, and hyperplasia of globet cells. Serosal edema was present. Ultrastructural examinations of jejunum and ileum from 3/7 diseased rabbits, revealed enterocytes in apoptosis, mixed with degenerative and/or necrotic changes together with infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and loss of microvillus. There were electron dense structures suggestive of virus particles inside the nuclei and cytoplasm of some enterocytes. There was lymphoid spleen atrophy and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in 7/7 rabbits. Interstitial pneumonia in 4/7 rabbits was found. Encephalitozoon cuniculi was detected in the brain of 1/7 rabbits. Escherichia coli were detected in 3/3 cases and Eimeria spp. in 2/3 cases. Mortality rate in the field study was 51.1% and the spread of the disease occur in 9/9 cages. The proportion of gamma-globulins in rabbits who survive an outbreak was much lower (P =0.0001) than free-disease healthy rabbits (8.1\u00B11.0 and 14.0\u00B11.0, respectively). The disease was multifactorial and consisted of sub-acute mucoid enteropathy probably induced by viral infection and aggravated by the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens common to rabbits.

Proteins annotated to play a role in membrane traffic were overrepresented among the depleted proteins whereas proteins annotated to the cytoskeleton showed a diverse behavior with some proteins being enriched, others being depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. To study the functional relevance of identified proteins in the Salmonella infection cycle, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were performed. siRNA\u2010mediated depletion of a selection of affected proteins identified five host factors involved in Salmonella infection. Depletion of peroxiredoxin\u20106 (PRDX6), isoform \u03B2\u20104c of integrin \u03B2\u20104 (ITGB4), isoform 1 of protein lap2 (erbin interacting protein; ERBB2IP), stomatin (STOM) or TBC domain containing protein 10b (TBC1D10B) resulted in increased Salmonella replication. Surprisingly, in addition to the effect on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of intracellular Salmonella microcolonies.

The present study describes causes of febrile illness in hospitalized children in Ghana and aims to determine the burden of malaria coinfections and their association with parasite densities. METHODS: In a prospective study, children (aged \u226530 days and \u226415 years) with fever \u226538.0\u00B0C were recruited after admission to the pediatric ward of a primary hospital in Ghana. Malaria parasitemia was determined and blood, stool, urine, respiratory, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens were screened for parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Associations of Plasmodium densities with other pathogens were calculated. RESULTS: From November 2013 to April 2015, 1238 children were enrolled from 4169 admissions. A clinical/microbiological diagnosis could be made in 1109/1238 (90%) patients, with Plasmodium parasitemia (n = 728/1238 [59%]) being predominant. This was followed by lower respiratory tract infections/pneumonia (n = 411/1238 [34%]; among detected pathogens most frequently Streptococcus pneumoniae, n = 192/299 [64%]), urinary tract infections (n = 218/1238 [18%]; Escherichia coli, n = 21/32 [66%]), gastrointestinal infections (n = 210 [17%]; rotavirus, n = 32/97 [33%]), and invasive bloodstream infections (n = 62 [5%]; Salmonella species, n = 47 [76%]). In Plasmodium-infected children the frequency of lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, and bloodstream infections increased with decreasing parasite densities. CONCLUSIONS: In a hospital setting, the likelihood of comorbidity with a nonmalarial disease is inversely correlated with increasing blood levels of malaria parasites. Hence, parasite densities provide important information as an indicator for the probability of coinfection, in particular to guide antimicrobial medication.","publish_time":"2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogan, Benedikt; Eibach, Daniel; Krumkamp, Ralf; Sarpong, Nimako; Dekker, Denise; Kreuels, Benno; Maiga-Ascofar\u00E9, Oumou; Gyau Boahen, Kennedy; Wiafe Akenten, Charity; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; May, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b7520912fbd483ef60014fe0e7f0d0c2df1d07e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dd154082007ef8be3cb53089778c04ea285e6b8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5982794.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix1120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["gastrointestinal infections","lower respiratory tract infections","urinary tract infections","Malaria parasitemia","invasive bloodstream infections","Plasmodium-infected children","decreasing parasite densities","Associations of Plasmodium densities","hospitalized children","Plasmodium parasitemia","frequency of lower respiratory tract","burden of malaria coinfections","Ghana","detected pathogens","viral pathogens","increasing blood levels of malaria parasites","epidemiology of pediatric febrile illness","causes of febrile illness","pediatric ward","hospital setting","primary hospital","prospective study","present study","likelihood of comorbidity","major cause of childhood morbidity","cerebrospinal fluid specimens","indicator","urine","sub-Saharan Africa","nonmalarial disease","important information","probability of coinfection","mortality","stool","Streptococcus pneumoniae","days","BACKGROUND","patients","antimicrobial medication","microbiological diagnosis","fever","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Escherichia coli","Salmonella species","admissions","rotavirus","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CLpro) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CLpro was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC50 ranging from 6.36 \u00B1 2.15 to 78.40 \u00B1 2.60 \u03BCM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC50 values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity.

In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. METHODS: The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. RESULTS: The Student\u0027s t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f(1)-score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods. CONCLUSION: This study outlines the implementation of an infection screening system, which achieved competent performance. The system might be beneficial for fast screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.","publish_time":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Cuong V.; Le Quang, Truong; Vu, Trung Nguyen; Le Thi, Hoi; Van, Kinh Nguyen; Trong, Thanh Han; Trong, Tuan Do; Sun, Guanghao; Ishibashi, Koichiro","journal":"Inform Med Unlocked","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/780f1e8693bb6f32fd116970fee4a4887fb0ffc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103934.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2019.100225; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914819302205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914819302205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Support Vector Machine","Quadratic Discriminant Analysis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection screening system","embedded system","gender","proposed machine learning methods","machine learning models","heart rate","proposed digital signal processing algorithms","study","fast screening of infected patients","Support Vector Machine","multiple vital signs","respiratory rate","data classification","standard deviation of heart beat","classification problem","variability of human cases","time-domain peak detection algorithm","public health centers","underdeveloped areas","people","flexible cut-off frequencies","specificity","non-contact","Quadratic Discriminant Analysis","main stages","Butterworth filters","Field Programmable Gate Array","medical radar","implementation","little access","Student\u0027s t-test","PYNQ-Z1","high sensitivity","competent performance","RESULTS","healthcare","infectious diseases","CONCLUSION","interval","accuracy","score","OBJECTIVES","addition"],"language":"en"},

The Mano River Union (MRU) countries of West Africa\u2013Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia\u2013have made incremental sustained investments into TB control programmes over the past two decades. The devastating Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014\u20132015 in West Africa impacted significantly on all sectors of the healthcare systems in the MRU countries, including the TB prevention and control programmes. The EVD outbreak also had an adverse impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare service delivery. At the height of the EVD outbreak, numerous staff members in all MRU countries contracted EBV at the Ebola treatment units and died. Many healthcare workers were also infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, TB morbidity and mortality, and decreased patient adherence to TB treatment, and the likely impact will not be known for several years to come. In this viewpoint, the impact that the EVD outbreak had on TB diagnostic, management, and prevention services is described. Vaccination against TB with BCG in children under 5 years of age was affected adversely by the EVD epidemic. The EVD outbreak was a result of global failure and represents yet another \u2018wake-up call\u2019 to the international community, and particularly to African governments, to reach a consensus on new ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels for building healthcare systems that can sustain their function during outbreaks. This is necessary so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansumana, Rashid; Keitell, Samuel; Roberts, Gregory M.T.; Ntoumi, Francine; Petersen, Eskild; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Zumla, Alimuddin","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ede826958e62657b37c75bcbf5570b26a88db97b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110799.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216311948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27818362/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.10.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216311948","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Global Tuberculosis Report","EVD","BCG"],"locations":["West Africa","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["EVD outbreak","TB treatment","TB prevention","TB services","EVD epidemic","TB morbidity","TB diagnostic","TB control programmes","MRU countries","healthcare workforce","healthcare facilities","healthcare workers","Ebola treatment units","countries of West Africa","building healthcare systems","disease control programmes","healthcare service delivery","new tuberculosis","Global Tuberculosis Report","global levels","peripheral health units","prevention services","adverse impact","likely impact","Africa Region","severe epidemic","devastating Ebola virus disease","Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission","result of global failure","national hospitals","years of age","World Health Organization","new ways of thinking","numerous staff members","Liberia","mortality","Guinea","incremental sustained investments","EBV","consensus","Sierra Leone","children","doubt","cases","management","patient adherence","Mano River Union","states","BCG","world\u0027s","sectors","disruption","African governments","Summary","emergency measures","Vaccination","decades","function","patients","height","international community","malaria","HIV","viewpoint","outbreaks","wake"],"language":"en"},

Factors contributing to IPNV pathogenicity are yet poorly understood. Indications of IPNV being able to evade or counteract innate host defense come from its lack of ability to induce strong type I interferon (IFN) responses in cell culture. We show here that addition of salmon rIFN-\u03B11 to cells prior to IPNV infection halts the viral protein synthesis and prevents processing of pVP2 into mature VP2. Furthermore, compared to pre-treatment with IFN-\u03B11 the antiviral state in cells infected with IPNV prior to IFN-treatment, was antagonized by IPNV, as detected by higher viral titers, faster viral protein synthesis and also by reduced Mx expression. The longer headstart the virus gets, the more prominent is the weakening of IFN signaling. IPNV VP4 and VP5 inhibit IFN-induced expression from the Mx promoter, indicating that these proteins contribute to the antagonistic effect.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skjesol, Astrid; Aamo, Toril; Hegseth, Marit N\u00F8st; Robertsen, B\u00F8rre; J\u00F8rgensen, Jorunn B.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bf587d8051a33e9e8215ef96afa025a943dc1b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114382.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170209001014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19463721/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170209001014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPNV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPNV infection","IPNV VP4","IPNV pathogenicity","Indications of IPNV","IFN-treatment","weakening of IFN","IFN-induced expression","faster viral protein synthesis","cells","higher viral titers","reduced Mx expression","Mx promoter","addition of salmon rIFN-\u03B11","Abstract Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus","interferon","lack of ability","strong type","processing of pVP2","antiviral state","responses","VP5","major pathogen","innate host defense","proteins","cell culture","aquaculture industry","mature VP2","pre-treatment","antagonistic effect","longer headstart","Factors"],"language":"en"},

In this research, we benefitted from the large PDB and performed a sequence analysis on Chameleons, where we developed an algorithm to extract peptide segments with identical sequences, but different structures. In order to find new chameleon sequences, we extracted a set of 8315 non-redundant protein sequences from the PDB with an identity less than 25%. Our data was classified to \u201Chelix to strand (HE)\u201D, \u201Chelix to coil (HC)\u201D and \u201Cstrand to coil (CE)\u201D alterations. We also analyzed the occurrence of singlet and doublet amino acids and the solvent accessibility in the chameleon sequences; we then sorted out the proteins with the most number of chameleon sequences and named them Chameleon Flexible Proteins (CFPs) in our dataset. Our data revealed that Gly, Val, Ile, Tyr and Phe, are the major amino acids in Chameleons. We also found that there are proteins such as Insulin Degrading Enzyme IDE and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) with the most number of chameleons (640 and 405 respectively). These proteins have known roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore it can be inferred that other CFP\u0027s can serve as key proteins in neurodegeneration, and a study on them can shed light on curing and preventing neurodegenerative diseases.","publish_time":"2016-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bahramali, Golnaz; Goliaei, Bahram; Minuchehr, Zarrin; Salari, Ali","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94927739dc67a85d71788be33110511e23e2be03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124260.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26920059/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X16301851; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X16301851","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDB (Protein Data Bank","Chameleon Flexible Proteins","Insulin Degrading Enzyme IDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of chameleon sequences","new chameleon sequences","Abstract Chameleon sequences","Chameleon Flexible Proteins","identical sequences","proteins responsible","key proteins","non-redundant protein sequences","number of chameleons","Protein Data Bank","nuclear protein Ran","large PDB","neurodegenerative diseases","neurodegeneration","coil conformation","strand","doublet amino acids","major amino acids","alpha helix sheet","GTP","Phe","solvent accessibility","Insulin Degrading Enzyme IDE","Tyr","Val","peptide segments","Ile","Gly","algorithm","light","occurrence of singlet","insight","sequence analysis","peptides","CFPs","different structures","curing","study","roles","order","CFP\u0027s","dataset","HC","identity","alterations","research"],"language":"en"},

They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","publish_time":"2018-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Longdon, Ben; Day, Jonathan P; Alves, Joel M; Smith, Sophia CL; Houslay, Thomas M; McGonigle, John E; Tagliaferri, Lucia; Jiggins, Francis M","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ace75b5b2e127c06918b044b04cf9f99730e0a1a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b1e7752cbf528db99723a3a67b49b9b5c6e449af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/226175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related host species","new host species","novel host species","different host species","related species","Host shifts","given species","different species of Drosophilidae","new pathogen","viral lineages","RNA virus","evolved replicate lineages","parallel genetic changes","new disease","Drosophila C Virus","novel hosts","viral genomes","strong pattern of parallel evolution","major source of emerging infectious diseases","fitness","adaptations","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Successive reinfection of individuals over a short time interval has been explicitly reported during past pandemics. However, the causes of rapid reinfection and the role of reinfection in driving multiple-wave outbreaks remain poorly understood. To investigate these issues, we focus on a two-wave influenza A/H3N2 epidemic that occurred on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in 1971. Over 59 days, 273 (96%) of 284 islanders experienced at least one attack and 92 (32%) experienced two attacks. We formulate six mathematical models invoking a variety of antigenic and immunological reinfection mechanisms. Using a maximum-likelihood analysis to confront model predictions with the reported incidence time series, we demonstrate that only two mechanisms can be retained: some hosts with either a delayed or deficient humoral immune response to the primary influenza infection were reinfected by the same strain, thus initiating the second epidemic wave. Both mechanisms are supported by previous empirical studies and may arise from a combination of genetic and ecological causes. We advocate that a better understanding and account of heterogeneity in the human immune response are essential to analysis of multiple-wave influenza outbreaks and pandemic planning.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Camacho, Anton; Ballesteros, S\u00E9bastien; Graham, Andrea L.; Carrat, Fabrice; Ratmann, Oliver; Cazelles, Bernard","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80ab1037161868297a622ae5e5e24a7f91d10bf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3203494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21525058/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.0300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wave influenza outbreaks","multiple-wave outbreaks","epidemic wave","immunological reinfection mechanisms","analysis of multiple","role of reinfection","causes of rapid reinfection","human immune response","primary influenza infection","Successive reinfection of individuals","deficient humoral immune response","human population","reported incidence time series","H3N2 epidemic","ecological causes","maximum-likelihood analysis","short time interval","model predictions","variety of antigenic","account of heterogeneity","pandemic planning","remote island of Tristan","combination of genetic","previous empirical studies","Cunha","better understanding","mathematical models","hosts","strain","past pandemics","islanders","issues","days","attacks"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the difference in the inhibition mechanism of viroporins, we synthesized symmetric dimeric adamantane analogs of various alkyl-spacer lengths. METHODS: Symmetric dimeric adamantane derivatives were synthesized where two amantadine or rimantadine molecules were linked by various alkyl-spacers. The inhibitory activity of the compounds was studied on two viroporins: the influenza virus M2 protein, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 channels for five different genotypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a) expressed in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. RESULTS: Upon testing on M2 protein, dimeric compounds showed significantly lower inhibitory activity relative to the monomeric amantadine. The lack of channel blockage of the dimeric amantadine and rimantadine analogs against M2 wild type and M2-S31N mutant was consistent with previously proposed drug-binding mechanisms and further confirmed that the pore-binding model is the pharmacologically relevant drug-binding model. On the other hand, these dimers showed similar potency to their respective monomeric analogs when tested on p7 protein in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4a while being 700-fold and 150-fold more potent than amantadine in genotypes 2a and 3a, respectively. An amino group appears to be important for inhibiting the ion-channel activity of p7 protein in genotype 2a, while its importance was minimal in all other genotypes. CONCLUSION: Symmetric dimeric adamantanes can be considered a prospective class of p7 inhibitors that are able to address the differences in adamantane sensitivity among the various genotypes of HCV.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mandour, Yasmine M; Breitinger, Ulrike; Ma, Chunlong; Wang, Jun; Boeckler, Frank M; Breitinger, Hans-Georg; Zlotos, Darius P","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cb5954efbc7ab4a0d43db196b9b58b3838945b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5933338.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s157104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dimeric amantadine","dimeric compounds","HCV genotypes","various genotypes of HCV","ion-channel activity of p7 protein","Symmetric dimeric adamantane derivatives","Symmetric dimeric adamantanes","monomeric amantadine","ion-channel activity of viroporins","different genotypes","influenza virus M2 protein","symmetric dimeric adamantane analogs of various alkyl-spacer lengths","Adamantane-based compounds","rimantadine analogs","p7 channels","adamantane sensitivity","M2 wild type","M2-S31N mutant","respective monomeric analogs","lower inhibitory activity relative","various alkyl-spacers","relevant drug-binding model","pore-binding model","fold","prospective class of p7 inhibitors","proposed drug-binding mechanisms","inhibition mechanism of viroporins","lack of channel blockage","rimantadine molecules","hepatitis C virus","electrode voltage-clamp technique","cell patch-clamp recording techniques","similar potency","testing","dimers","differences","Xenopus oocytes","METHODS","HEK293 cells","hand","importance","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","viral infection","amino group"],"language":"en"},

They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply. This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pope, Janet E.","journal":"Curr Treatm Opt Rheumatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19bc9c316614e8057f6c917116671f5d05452ed5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355607/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40674-020-00145-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fear of rheumatic medications","systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases","gender matched patients","pandemic","risk of developing COVID","RECENT FINDINGS","drug shortages","drug availability","subsequent under-treatment","diversion of medication supply","underlying medication condition","social isolation","illness","similar outcomes","job loss","people","long term effects","chronic concomitant fatigue","physician visits","uncertainty","post-traumatic stress","work exposure","pain","fibromyalgia","press","stressors","outbreak","infections","SARS-CoV","data","coverage","hydroxychloroquine","articles","reasons","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","advanced therapies","worse outcome"],"language":"en"},

The feature extraction based on graphical representation is one of the most effective and efficient ways. However, most existing methods suffer limitations from their method design. RESULTS: We introduce DCGR, a novel method for extracting features from protein sequences based on the chaos game representation, which is developed by constructing CGR curves of protein sequences according to physicochemical properties of amino acids, followed by converting the CGR curves into multi-dimensional feature vectors by using the distributions of points in CGR images. Tested on five data sets, DCGR was significantly superior to the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. CONCLUSION: The DCGR is practically powerful for extracting effective features from protein sequences, and therefore important in similarity analysis of protein sequences, study of protein-protein interactions and prediction of protein functions.

Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7\u201314. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14\u201321. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3\u20134 week old pigs were higher than those of 3\u20135 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs. Moreover, our results support the use of gnotobiotic piglets as an animal model to evaluate active antibody responses and protection against rotavirus infection and disease.","publish_time":"1995-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei-Kang; Campbell, Thomas; VanCott, John; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bbe4bc49ad4817bf80b5bde3884fc1e1c9bc548.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016524279405343Q; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016524279405343Q","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gottfried"],"organizations":["PID","ASC","IgA ASC"],"locations":["LP"],"keyphrases":["Rotavirus specific IgA ASC","rotavirus-specific IgA","Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC","IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios","rotavirus infection","Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA","specific IgG ASC","numbers of specific IgA ASC","Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs","ASC responses","IgG ASC ratios","rotavirus antigen coatings","site of rotavirus replication","rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates","various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings","greater numbers of specific IgM ASC","relative ratios of specific IgA","rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates","similar specific immunoglobulin","PID","spleens of gnotobiotic pigs","mucosal antibody responses","day old pigs","active antibody responses","MLN tissues","gut LP","intestinal LP","challenge of SB1A","week old pigs","ELISPOT technique","nonstructural viral antigens","viral structural antigens","intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses","antibody-secreting cells","use of gnotobiotic piglets","similar diarrhea","porcine rotaviruses","virus shedding","G type","different ages","small intestine","node cells","high degree of protection","distinct P type","post-inoculation day","different age groups","animal model","patterns","mesenteric lymph nodes","enzyme-linked immunospot","lamina propria","G4P6","tissue adjacent","G4P7","assay","order","results","Abstract","disease"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Purpose. \u2013 In the geriatric units of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, 129 cases of fever (38\u00B0 C or more) were recorded prospectively during the 1995\u20131996 winter period in a population of 503 hospitalised patients (25.6%), and were investigated for the detection of a viral aetiology. Methods. \u2013 In febrile patients, a standard form was used to record clinical and biological parameters, including the results of investigations for respiratory viruses from a nasal swab and dual serum specimens. Results. \u2013 A clinical or radiological respiratory infection was found in 69 cases (53.5% of all cases of fever), including 14 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. In comparison to nonviral respiratory infections, the RSV infections were characterised by the prevalence of anorexia (57% vs 20%, P \u003C 0,05) and rhinorrhea (64% vs 5%, P \u003C 0,01). No influenza infection was recorded despite the concomitant circulation of influenza virus in the community. A nosocomial outbreak of RSV infection (nine cases, attack rate of 18.7%) was identified in a long-stay care unit. Conclusion. \u2013 This study illustrates the high prevalence (10.9%) of RSV infections in elderly patients with fever during this season and the importance of hygienic measures to control the spread of nosocomial outbreaks.","publish_time":"2001-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sivier, V; Odelin, M.

One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5\u0027-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5\u0027-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of \u003C 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5\u0027 leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 249 patients who underwent curative transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for primary or recurrent NMIBC were asked to complete the Korean version of EORTC QLQ-C30 and -NMIBC24 questionnaires three times (preoperative, post-TURBT 3 months and 6 months). Linguistic validation and psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire was conducted. RESULTS: Multitrait scaling analysis confirmed satisfactory construct validity in five scales except the malaise scale. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach\u2019s alpha \u2265 0.70) for the five scales except the malaise scale at the all three time points. Known-group comparison analyses showed better quality-of-life (QOL) scores in patients with higher performance status as expected, and better sexual function in men than women (p \u003C 0.05). Most of the scales had low correlations (\u003C 0.40) with the scales in QLQ-C30 showing divergent validity, except for malaise scale which showed higher correlations (0.42 to 0.60). Responsiveness to change was consistent with clinical implications over time after TURBT. CONCLUSION: The Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 has good reliability and cross-cultural validity for measuring various QOL aspects that can be self-administered to Korean NMIBC patients undergoing TURBT.","publish_time":"2017-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jinsung; Shin, Dong Wook; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Jung, Seung Il; Nam, Jong Kil; Park, Seung Chol; Hong, Sungwoo; Jung, Jae Hung; Kim, Hongwook; Kim, Won Tae","journal":"Cancer Res Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1560d77c8e16b3b283f328b1c3de5513014522e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5784644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279061/; https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2016.594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer","TURBT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Korean NMIBC patients","scales","Korean version of EORTC QLQ-C30","EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24","malaise scale","post-TURBT","cross-cultural validity","divergent validity","NMIBC24 questionnaires","Korean non-muscle invasive bladder cancer","recurrent NMIBC","months","higher correlations","satisfactory construct validity","Treatment of Cancer","better quality","good reliability","psychometric evaluation","psychometric properties","time points","low correlations","better sexual function","various QOL aspects","higher performance status","curative transurethral resection of bladder tumor","Multitrait scaling analysis","scores","Research","times","clinical implications","European Organization","women","life","change","RESULTS","Internal consistency","Cronbach\u2019s alpha","group comparison analyses","total","Linguistic validation","Responsiveness","METHODS","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

Experimentally adding just one extremely bold individual increased the foraging aggressiveness of entire colonies and altered the total mass gained by fellow group members, relative to the addition of a less bold individual. Additionally, our data suggest that bold individuals are capable of such influence because they catalyse variation in the behavioural tendencies of fellow group members.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pruitt, Jonathan N.; Keiser, Carl N.","journal":"Animal Behaviour","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a95b86356881869e3a6245dc7606fa2c8753c1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119443.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003347214001882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287335/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214001882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Stegodyphus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collective behaviour of colonies","bold individuals","behaviour of colonies\u0027 boldest individual","collective behaviour of social groups","behavioural tendencies of putative keystone individuals","single best predictor of colonies\u0027 collective behaviour","behavioural tendencies of fellow group members","single individual of varying boldness","Behavioural ecologists","colonies of identical size","foraging aggressiveness of entire colonies","social spider Stegodyphus dumicola","meticulous field observations","total mass","semi-scientific anecdotes","personality composition","laboratory","traits","addition","variation","influence","data","causal relationship","Prior studies","understanding","study"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction Multiple studies carried out around the globe have concluded that there is a seasonal effect on the births of patients that will go on to develop schizophrenia later on. A relationship between being exposed to certain infectious agents during the prenatal period and possible direct effects on the developing brain that will later be expressed by the classical clinical picture has been suggested. Objective To analyze the behavior of births in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia from Santa Marta, Colombia. Methods Descriptive study based on the review of clinical histories of the patients seen in a psychiatric institute. Discussion A larger number of births took place during the rainiest months of the year suggesting a possible seasonal effect. However, the lack of data on births in Santa Marta during the years of the study did not allow a comparison between the results of the study and the birth rates of the general population. Even so, these findings have implications for future research regarding seasonality of schizophrenia in Colombia. They do not reflect an individual risk of developing the illness but they do document the characteristics of the temporal behavior of the births in the sample studied. Further studies that overcome the limitations of the present one are needed.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDaz, Jairo M.

The S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV carries out fusion between the virus and the host cells. However, the exact mechanism of the cell fusion process is not well understood. Current model suggests that a conformational transition, upon receptor recognition, of the two heptad core regions of S2 may expose the hydrophobic fusogenic peptide or fusion peptide for membrane insertion. Three regions of the S2 subunit have been proposed to be involved in cell\u2013cell fusion. The N-terminal fusion peptide (FP, residues 770\u2013788), an internal fusion peptide (IFP, residues 873\u2013888) and the pre-transmembrane region (PTM, residues 1185\u20131202) demonstrated interactions with model lipid membranes and potentially involved in the fusion process. Here, we have determined atomic resolution structures of these three peptides in DPC detergent micelles by solution NMR. FP assumes \u03B1-helical conformation with significant distortion at the central Gly residues; enabling a close packing among sidechains of aromatic residues including W, Y and F. The 3-D structure of PMT is characterized by a helix\u2013loop\u2013helix with extensive aromatic interactions within the helices. IFP adopts a rather straight \u03B1-helical conformation defined by packing among sidechains of aromatic and aliphatic residues.

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe CAP of polymicrobial aetiology in patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: The prospective observational study included 362 consecutive adult patients with CAP admitted to the ICU within 24 hours of presentation; 196 (54%) patients had an established aetiology. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in 39 (11%) cases (20% of those with defined aetiology): 33 cases with two pathogens, and six cases with three pathogens. The most frequently identified pathogens in polymicrobial infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 28, 72%), respiratory viruses (n = 15, 39%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8, 21%). Chronic respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were independent predictors of polymicrobial aetiology. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was more frequent in the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (39% vs. 10%, P \u003C 0.001), and was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 10.79, 95% confidence interval = 3.97 to 29.30; P \u003C 0.001). The trend for higher hospital mortality of the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (n = 8, 21% versus n = 17, 11%), however, was not significantly different (P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Polymicrobial pneumonia occurs frequently in patients admitted to the ICU. This is a risk factor for inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment, which in turn independently predicts hospital mortality.","publish_time":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cill\u00F3niz, Catia; Ewig, Santiago; Ferrer, Miquel; Polverino, Eva; Gabarr\u00FAs, Albert; Puig de la Bellacasa, Jorge; Mensa, Josep; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e04d01abc78572a0af66d7f9343193a2278e80dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3334753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21914220/; https://doi.org/10.1186/cc10444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["ICU","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polymicrobial aetiology group","independent predictors of polymicrobial aetiology","clinical significance of polymicrobial aetiology","Polymicrobial pneumonia","monomicrobial aetiology group","defined aetiology","established aetiology","polymicrobial infections","outcomes of severe CAP of polymicrobial aetiology","ICU","cases","consecutive adult patients","higher hospital mortality","independent predictor of hospital mortality","respiratory viruses","Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment","present study","identified pathogens","Chronic respiratory disease","clinical characteristics","acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria","prospective observational study","adjusted odds ratio","community","Streptococcus pneumoniae","prevalence","risk factor","frequency","confidence interval","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","trend","RESULTS","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","hours of presentation","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We collected 700 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing (northern China) and Shanghai (southern China). Multiple respiratory viruses (including 15 common viruses) were screened by validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays and confirmed by sequencing. Demographic data and the distribution of viral infections were also examined. RESULTS: Of 700 samples, 547 (78.1%) tested positive for viral infections. The picornaviruses (PIC), which included rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV), were the most common (34.0%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (28.3%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (19.1%), adenovirus (ADV) (13.7%), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (10.7%), influenza A and B (8.9%), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1\u20133) (7.9%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.0%). PIC (RV/EV) and RSV were the most prevalent etiological agents of SARI in both cities. The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and hMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Different age and seasonal distribution patterns of the viral infections were found between Beijing and Shanghai.

The shRNAs were transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited PHEV production. Our results revealed that both shRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral RNA genome replication, especially shN2. Next, stable transfection of shN2 was used to produce two siRNA stably expressing PK-15 cell clones (shN2-1 and shN2-2), and these two lines were infected with PHEV. The analysis of cytopathic effects (CPE) demonstrated that shN2-1 and shN2-2 were capable of protecting cells against PHEV infection with high specificity and efficiency. Furthermore, effective inhibition of viral replication persisted for up to 120h by a TCID50 assay. These results indicated that RNAi targeting of the N gene could facilitate studies of the specific function of viral genes associated with PHEV replication and may have potential therapeutic applications.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; He, Wenqi; Wang, Gaili; Lu, Huijun; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfb55f354691985ee5991b150b41d86cc6450095.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112858.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22138683/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411004447; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411004447; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.11.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV replication","PHEV infection","PHEV production","stable transfection of shN2","porcine encephalomyelitis","viral RNA genome replication","effective inhibition of viral replication","porcine kidney cell line","cell clones","PK","RNAi","shRNAs","results","Abstract Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","host cell interactions","specific function of viral genes","N gene","RNA interference","important regulators of virus","siRNA expression plasmids","nucleocapsid protein","pathways","high specificity","studies","cells","different coding regions","CPE","efficiency","shN1","potential therapeutic applications","analysis of cytopathic effects","study","swine","TCID50 assay","constructs","lines"],"language":"en"},

The crystal structure of Nsp9 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E reveals a novel disulfide-linked homodimer, which is very different from the previously reported Nsp9 dimer of SARS coronavirus. In contrast, the structure of the Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 shows the same dimer organization as the SARS-CoV protein. In the crystal, the wild-type HCoV-229E protein forms a trimer of dimers, whereas the mutant and SARS-CoV Nsp9 are organized in rod-like polymers. Chemical cross-linking suggests similar modes of aggregation in solution. In zone-interference gel electrophoresis assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments, the HCoV-229E wild-type protein is found to bind oligonucleotides with relatively high affinity, whereas binding by the Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants is observed only for the longest oligonucleotides. The corresponding mutations in SARS-CoV Nsp9 do not hamper nucleic acid binding. From the crystal structures, a model for single-stranded RNA binding by Nsp9 is deduced. We propose that both forms of the Nsp9 dimer are biologically relevant; the occurrence of the disulfide-bonded form may be correlated with oxidative stress induced in the host cell by the viral infection.","publish_time":"2008-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ponnusamy, Rajesh; Moll, Ralf; Weimar, Thomas; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef9ef4544974adca08fac249d0a1102cadf2ff0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18694760/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608009406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283608009406; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.07.071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Chemical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E Nsp9","SARS-CoV Nsp9","crystal structure of Nsp9","SARS-CoV protein","reported Nsp9 dimer of SARS coronavirus","E wild-type protein","Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV","wild-type HCoV","single-stranded RNA binding","dimer organization","Abstract Non-structural protein","crystal structures","forms","nucleic acid binding","human coronavirus","viral infection","longest oligonucleotides","disulfide-bonded form","viral replication complex","novel disulfide-linked homodimer","surface plasmon resonance experiments","zone-interference gel electrophoresis assays","model","similar modes of aggregation","host cell","occurrence","oxidative stress","trimer of dimers","Chemical cross-linking","corresponding mutations","Cys69Ser mutants","high affinity","solution","rod","coronaviruses","contrast","polymers"],"language":"en"},

Each mutation is called a \u0022synthetic lethal\u0022 (SL) or a co-lethal. Like invariant positions, SL sets (SL linked couples) are choice targets for drug design against fast-escaping RNA viruses: mutational viral escape by loss of affinity to the drug may induce (synthetic) lethality. RESULTS: From an amino acid sequence alignment of the HIV protease, we detected the potential SL couples, potential SL sets, and invariant positions. From the 3D structure of the same protein we focused on the ones that were close to each other and accessible on the protein surface, to possibly bind putative drugs. We aligned 24,155 HIV protease amino acid sequences and identified 290 potential SL couples and 25 invariant positions. After applying the distance and accessibility filter, three candidate drug design targets of respectively 7 (under the flap), 4 (in the cantilever) and 5 (in the fulcrum) amino acid positions were found. CONCLUSIONS: These three replication-critical targets, located outside of the active site, are key to our anti-escape strategy. Indeed, biological evidence shows that 2/3 of those target positions perform essential biological functions. Their mutational variations to escape antiviral medication could be lethal, thus limiting the apparition of drug-resistant strains.

Recent studies implicating microbial pattern-recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as well as inflammatory cytokines and their signalling pathways, in testicular function have cast new light on this mysterious link between infection/inflammation and testicular dysfunction. It is increasingly evident that signalling pathways normally involved in controlling inflammation play fundamental roles in regulating Sertoli cell activity and responses to reproductive hormones, in addition to promoting immune responses within the testis. Many of the negative effects of inflammation on spermatogenesis may be attributed to elevated production of inflammation-related gene products within the circulation and the testis, which subsequently exert disruptive effects on spermatogenic cell development and survival, as well as the ability of the Sertoli cells to provide support for spermatogenesis. These interactions have important implications for testicular dysfunction and disease, and may eventually provide new opportunities for therapeutic interventions.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedger, Mark P.","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33f33fd590a717bd97cae54bdefe17523429a750.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127151.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2011.01.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21333360/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165037811000167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037811000167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systemic inflammation","negative effects of inflammation","elevated production of inflammation","testicular dysfunction","infection","testicular function","spermatogenesis","signalling pathways","disease","testis","Sertoli cell activity","reproductive hormones","reproductive tract","new light","Sertoli cells","disruptive effects","immune responses","new opportunities","male fertility","spermatogenic cell development","microbial pattern-recognition receptors","related gene products","mysterious link","survival","addition","important implications","fundamental roles","Recent studies","circulation","Toll","interactions","inflammatory cytokines","therapeutic interventions","TLRs","ability","observation","support"],"language":"en"},

The impact of any intervention depends on its efficiency as well as efficacy, and efficient isolation of infected individuals before they become symptomatic is difficult to imagine. Nonetheless, in exploring the possible impact of quarantine, the product of efficiency and efficacy was varied over the entire unit interval. Another mistake was repeatedly fitting otherwise appropriate gamma distributions to times to event regardless of whether they were stationary or not, particularly onset-isolation intervals whose progressive reduction evidently contributed to SARS control. By virtue of their unknown biology, newly-emerging diseases are more challenging than familiar human scourges. Influenza, for example, recurs annually and has been modeled more thoroughly than any other infectious disease. Moreover, models were integrated into preparedness exercises, during which working relationships were established that bore fruit during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. To provide the most accurate and timely advice possible, especially about the possible impact of measures designed to control diseases caused by novel human pathogens, we must appreciate the value and difficulty of policy-oriented modeling. Effective communication of insights gleaned from modeling SARS will help to ensure that policymakers involve modelers in future outbreaks of newly-emerging infectious diseases. Accordingly, we illustrate the increasingly timely care-seeking by which, together with increasingly accurate diagnoses and effective isolation, SARS was controlled via heuristic arguments and descriptive analyses of familiar observations.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glasser, John W.; Hupert, Nathaniel; McCauley, Mary M.; Hatchett, Richard","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/263fa43731ae883ad00fa313882ae77e375622f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2011.01.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436511000028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436511000028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21420657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modeling SARS","SARS control","possible impact of quarantine","possible impact of measures","emerging diseases","effective isolation","SARS crisis","real-time impact","emerging infectious diseases","efficacy","timely advice possible","onset-isolation intervals","familiar human scourges","efficient isolation of infected individuals","oriented modeling","accurate diagnoses","product of efficiency","Abstract Modelers","timely care","Effective communication of insights","novel human pathogens","descriptive analyses of familiar observations","heuristic arguments","progressive reduction","future outbreaks","thoughtful articles","relationships","value","difficulty of policy","unknown biology","policymakers","appropriate gamma distributions","means","preparedness exercises","times","global response","entire unit interval","bore fruit","lingering misunderstanding","models","mistake","virtue","intervention","H1N1 pandemic","Influenza","example","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is \u003E95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination. Aims The objective of this study was to review the infectious diseases situation among Syrian refugees in Turkey. Sources We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Content Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Implications Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions. Based on available data and our detailed analysis, the numbers show a stable situation regarding infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erg\u00F6n\u00FCl, \u00D6.; T\u00FClek, N.; Kay\u0131, I.; Irmak, H.; Erdem, O.; Dara, M.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7fdcdf8313c4e0ff060a84ec3244bedd8d03396.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129060.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X19303672; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X19303672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Syria","Turkey"],"keyphrases":["Turkey","influx of Syrian refugees","highest number of Syrian refugees","cases of leishmaniasis","active tuberculosis cases","detailed data","infectious diseases situation","temporary shelters immunization coverage","vaccination","cases of respiratory tract infection","detailed analysis","stable situation","available data","conflict zones","significant increase","transmitted infections","cutaneous leishmaniasis","non-governmental organizations","disrupted healthcare services","episodes of diarrhoea","children","hepatitis","numbers","bloody diarrhoeas","Ministry of Health","refugee population","reports","studies","study","living","vector","vulnerable group","measles","Implications","world","Abstract Background","Sources","objective","conditions","Content","people","safety"],"language":"en"},

HCoV infections, especially those caused by the two HCoVs identified most recently, NL63 and HKU\u20101, have not been characterized fully. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical presentations of HKU1 and NL63 in adults with acute respiratory tract infections, an investigation of HCoV infections in Beijing, China from 2005 to 2009 was performed by using reverse transcriptase PCR assays and sequencing analysis. Among 8,396 respiratory specimens studied, 87 (1%) clinical samples were positive for HCoVs, of which 50 samples (0.6% of the total) were positive for HCoV\u2010OC43, 15 (0.2%) for HCoV\u2010229E, 14 (0.2%) for HCoV\u2010HKU1, and 8 (0.1%) for HCoV\u2010NL63.

This method, as with all microarray applications, requires adequate coverage of probes targeting the regions of interest. An unbiased tiling of probes across the entire length of the genome is the most flexible design approach. However, such a whole-genome tiling requires that the genome sequence is known in advance. For the accurate analysis of uncharacterized bacteria, an array must query a fully representative set of sequences from the species\u0027 pan-genome. Prior microarrays have included only a single strain per array or the conserved sequences of gene families. These arrays omit potentially important genes and sequence variants from the pan-genome. RESULTS: This paper presents a new probe selection algorithm (PanArray) that can tile multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of probes. Unlike arrays built on clustered gene families, PanArray uses an unbiased, probe-centric approach that does not rely on annotations, gene clustering, or multi-alignments. Instead, probes are evenly tiled across all sequences of the pan-genome at a consistent level of coverage. To minimize the required number of probes, probes conserved across multiple strains in the pan-genome are selected first, and additional probes are used only where necessary to span polymorphic regions of the genome. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated by array designs for seven different bacterial pan-genomes and, in particular, the design of a 385,000 probe array that fully tiles the genomes of 20 different Listeria monocytogenes strains with overlapping probes at greater than twofold coverage. CONCLUSION: PanArray is an oligonucleotide probe selection algorithm for tiling multiple genome sequences using a minimal number of probes. It is capable of fully tiling all genomes of a species on a single microarray chip. These unique pan-genome tiling arrays provide maximum flexibility for the analysis of both known and uncharacterized strains.","publish_time":"2009-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillippy, Adam M; Deng, Xiangyu; Zhang, Wei; Salzberg, Steven L","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/670ade9d86b2fb507104d011a048323450e21b59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2753849.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19758451/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple genome sequences","species\u0027 pan-genome","unbiased tiling of probes","overlapping probes","unique pan-genome tiling arrays","additional probes","minimal number of probes","probe array","adequate coverage of probes","required number of probes","different bacterial pan-genomes","multiple strains","PanArray","array designs","conserved sequences of gene families","new probe selection algorithm","oligonucleotide probe selection algorithm","uncharacterized strains","probe-centric approach","Array comparative genomic hybridization","sequence variants","representative set of sequences","gene clustering","clustered gene families","twofold coverage","genomic sequence of unknown bacterial isolates","different Listeria monocytogenes strains","consistent level of coverage","single microarray chip","flexible design approach","single strain","microarray applications","cost-effective method","accurate analysis of uncharacterized bacteria","polymorphic regions","maximum flexibility","paper","important genes","entire length","annotations","BACKGROUND","genotyping","multi-alignments","CONCLUSION","Prior microarrays","RESULTS","advance","viability"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Forty-eight patients, all diagnosed with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 in 2009, were retrospectively included in this study. Each patient in the study was monitored for 11-13 months by standard pulmonary function examination. The examination included monitoring respiratory tract infection symptoms (cough, expectoration or gasping) and vital signs. Long-term changes in symptoms and changes in vital signs were correlated back to and compared with the severity of the initial H1N1 influenza infection. RESULTS: One year post discharge, mild to moderate pulmonary dysfunction was observed in the majority of patients. Further, 54.2% of patients had signs of severe abnormal pulmonary function, including diffusion disorder (33.3%) and small airway dysfunction (33.3%). Fourteen patients presented with respiratory tract infection symptoms; 12 with abnormal pulmonary function and two with normal pulmonary function. Our results indicated that the change in pulmonary function at one year post discharge was not significantly correlated with the severity of H1N1 influenza. CONCLUSION: Signs and symptoms of abnormal pulmonary function accompanied by respiratory tract infection symptoms remain for some patients after one year following discharge from the hospital for mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection. These patients should continue to be monitored for any changes in condition and symptoms and rehabilitation treatment should be provided when necessary.","publish_time":"2015-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wei; Peng, Liping; Liu, Hongmei; Hua, Shucheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e642816c09dd07b7bdf515088670a72ee8698bd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4517883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26218647/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms of abnormal pulmonary function","signs of severe abnormal pulmonary function","standard pulmonary function examination","initial H1N1 influenza infection","mild influenza","severity of H1N1 influenza","monitoring respiratory tract infection symptoms","majority of patients","cohort of patients","virus subtype H1N1 infection","moderate pulmonary dysfunction","long-term effects of mild H1N1 influenza infection","vital signs","year post discharge","Long-term changes","RESULTS","study","small airway dysfunction","cough","expectoration","hospital","gasping","diffusion disorder","rehabilitation treatment","condition","months","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we sought to leverage this uneven viral antagonism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome. Utilizing a systems-based approach, we examined differential regulation of IFN-\u03B3\u2013dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [A/influenza/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) and A/influenza/California/04/2009 (H1N1-CA04)] and coronaviruses [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)]. Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV\u2013mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Walters, Kevin B.; Nicora, Carrie D.; Purvine, Samuel O.; Casey, Cameron P.; Monroe, Matthew E.; Weitz, Karl K.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Metz, Thomas O.; Smith, Richard D.; Waters, Katrina M.; Sims, Amy C.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82256b182006e2f9abcd1475c906b290a8daad13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5798318.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706928115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29339515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","antigen presentation","H5N1-VN1203","SARS-CoV","regulation of antigen","presentation gene expression","influenza viruses","regulation of gene expression","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","mediated antagonism of antigen","robust respiratory viruses","host adaptive immune response","critical host factors","diverse groups of viruses","distinct host pathways","differential regulation of IFN","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","epigenetic analysis","uneven viral antagonism","combination of epigenetic mechanisms","coronaviruses","dependent genes","crucial role","histone modification","DNA methylation","Convergent evolution dictates","contrast","H1N1-CA04","disease outcome","common mechanism","Vietnam","systems-based approach","California","proteomics","results","examination","function","study"],"language":"en"},

Key questions include the source (an infected human, animal, or insect vector), the transmission mechanism, and how the virus is shed and transmitted. Following transmission, pathogenesis is governed by the initial site of replication, whether the virus disseminates within the host, and its tropism for specific tissues and organs. In turn, these steps are dictated by the structure and replication strategy of the virus. In addition to utilizing selected synthetic biochemical pathways in the host cell, viruses frequently reprogram host cells by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that render the cell more permissive. Host\u2013virus interactions also control whether the infection is acute, chronic, latent, or transforming; how the virus interacts with the immune system; and the consequent pathophysiological response of the host.

There are unique considerations for many adult patients with gliomas who are vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to older age and immunosuppression. As patients with terminal illnesses, they present ethical challenges for centers that may need to ration access to ventilator care due to insufficient critical care capacity. It is urgent for the neuro-oncology community to develop a pro-active and coordinated approach to the care of adults with gliomas in order to provide them with the best possible oncologic care while also reducing their risk of viral infection during times of potential healthcare system failure. In this article, we present an approach developed by an international multi-disciplinary group to optimize the care of adults with gliomas during this pandemic. We recommend measures to promote strict social distancing and minimize exposures for patients, address risk and benefit of all therapeutic interventions, pro-actively develop end of life plans, educate patients and caregivers and ensure the health of the multi-disciplinary neuro-oncology workforce. This pandemic is already changing neuro-oncologic care delivery around the globe. It is important to highlight opportunities to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of glioma management during this pandemic and potentially, in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohile, Nimish A; Blakeley, Jaishri O; Gatson, Na Tosha N; Hottinger, Andreas F; Lassman, Andrew B; Ney, Douglas E; Olar, Adriana; Schiff, David; Shih, Helen A; Strowd, Roy; van den Bent, Martin J; Ziu, Mateo","journal":"Neuro Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a47f8341776d8a0639905170f041a1f0364af45.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277236/; https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noaa090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care of adults","neuro-oncologic care delivery","gliomas","pandemic","adult patients","best possible oncologic care","insufficient critical care capacity","address risk","benefit","multi-disciplinary neuro-oncology workforce","neuro-oncology community","risk of viral infection","risk of glioma management","international multi-disciplinary group","ethical challenges","coordinated approach","healthcare systems","times of potential healthcare system failure","exposures","therapeutic interventions","end of life plans","novel coronavirus","communities","unprecedented risks","older age","outbreak","caregivers","ventilator","terminal illnesses","order","strict social distancing","unique considerations","immunosuppression","access","centers","globe","COVID","opportunities","article","future"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 \u00D7 10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1\u20132 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.

Eight days before onset of symptoms, he visited a municipal hospital that was later identified as the epicenter of a large outbreak of SARS. On admission to National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei, the patient experienced chest tightness, progressive dyspnea, and low-grade fever. His condition rapidly deteriorated with increasing respiratory difficulty, and he died 7 days after admission. The most prominent histopathologic finding was diffuse alveolar damage of the lung. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization assays demonstrated evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in various respiratory epithelial cells, predominantly type II pneumocytes, and in alveolar macrophages in the lung. Electron microscopic examination also revealed coronavirus particles in the pneumocytes, and their identity was confirmed as SARS-CoV by immunogold labeling electron microscopy. This report is the first to describe the cellular localization of SARS-CoV in human lung tissue by using a combination of immunohistochemistry, double-stain immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, and immunogold labeling electron microscopy.

Viruses lacking 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity exhibited attenuation in primary macrophages that was rescued in cells lacking Ifit1 gene expression. Here, we examined the role of Ifit1 in restricting pathogenesis in vivo of wild type WNV (WNV-WT) and a mutant in the NS5 gene (WNV-E218A) lacking 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u2032 viral RNA cap. While deletion of Ifit1 had marginal effects on WNV-WT pathogenesis, WNV-E218A showed increased replication in peripheral tissues of Ifit1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice after subcutaneous infection, yet this failed to correlate with enhanced infection in the brain or lethality. In comparison, WNV-E218A was virulent after intracranial infection as judged by increased infection in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and a greater than 16,000-fold decrease in LD(50) values in Ifit1 (\u2212/\u2212) compared to wild type mice. Ex vivo infection experiments revealed cell-type specific differences in the ability of an Ifit1 deficiency to complement the replication defect of WNV-E218A. In particular, WNV-E218A infection was impaired in both wild type and Ifit1 (\u2212/\u2212) brain microvascular endothelial cells, which are believed to participate in blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulation of virus entry into the CNS. A deficiency of Ifit1 also was associated with increased neuronal death in vivo, which was both cell-intrinsic and mediated by immunopathogenic CD8(\u002B) T cells. Our results suggest that virulent strains of WNV have largely evaded the antiviral effects of Ifit1, and viral mutants lacking 2\u2032-O methylation are controlled in vivo by Ifit1-dependent and -independent mechanisms in different cell types.","publish_time":"2012-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szretter, Kristy J.; Daniels, Brian P.; Cho, Hyelim; Gainey, Maria D.; Yokoyama, Wayne M.; Gale, Michael; Virgin, Herbert W.; Klein, Robyn S.; Sen, Ganes C.; Diamond, Michael S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c20b981bab1fda3ce4c37eaa63bab33cb4ba88db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3349756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589727/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV-E218A infection","Ifit1 deficiency","deficiency of Ifit1","deletion of Ifit1","Ifit1-dependent","role of Ifit1","wild type WNV","viral evasion of Ifit1","antiviral effects of Ifit1","Ifit1 gene expression","increased infection","WNV-WT pathogenesis","peripheral tissues of Ifit1","replication defect of WNV","virulent strains of WNV","infection experiments","intracranial infection","enhanced infection","subcutaneous infection","O methylation","wild type mice","increased replication","cell-type specific differences","O methyltransferase activity of flaviviruses","viral mutants","different cell types","viral RNA","cell-intrinsic","CNS","T cells","brain microvascular endothelial cells","increased neuronal death","blood-brain barrier","different regions","marginal effects","NS5 gene","coronaviruses","BBB","interferon-stimulated innate immune effector protein","independent mechanisms","central nervous system","primary macrophages","regulation of virus entry","attenuation","poxviruses","ability","immunopathogenic CD8","fold decrease","values","results","lethality","comparison","Prior studies"],"language":"en"},

We previously showed that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike domain 2 (S2) in the patient sera can cross-react with human lung epithelial cells; however, the autoantigen is not yet identified. In this study, we performed proteomic studies and identified several candidate autoantigens recognized by SARS patient sera in human lung type II epithelial cell A549. Among the candidate proteins, annexin A2, which was identified by mass spectrometry analysis and had the highest score by Mascot data search, was further characterized and investigated for its role as an autoantigen. By confocal microscopic observation, SARS patient sera and anti-S2 antibodies were co-localized on A549 cells and both of them were co-localized with anti-annexin A2 antibodies. Anti-annexin A2 antibodies bound to purified S2 proteins, and anti-S2 bound to immunoprecipitated annexin A2 from A549 cell lysate in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, an increased surface expression and raft-structure distribution of annexin A2 was present in A549 cells after stimulation with SARS-induced cytokines interleukin-6 and interferon-\u03B3. Cytokine stimulation increased the binding capability of anti-S2 antibodies to human lung epithelial cells. Together, the upregulated expression of annexin A2 by SARS-associated cytokines and the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV S2 antibodies to annexin A2 may have implications in SARS disease pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Yi-Ting; Lin, Chiou-Feng; Liao, Pao-Chi; Kuo, Yu-Min; Wang, Shuying; Yeh, Trai-Ming; Shieh, Chi-Chang K.; Su, Ih-Jen; Lei, Huan-Yao; Lin, Yee-Shin","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3f2f2bda97bc9182101eb7ec868d34fd7a4f223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112629.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589009008463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015551/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2009.11.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589009008463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-annexin A2 antibodies","anti-SARS-CoV S2 antibodies","immunoprecipitated annexin A2","SARS patient sera","upregulated expression of annexin A2","SARS-associated cytokines","binding capability of anti-S2 antibodies","S2 proteins","A549 cells","human lung epithelial cells","raft-structure distribution of annexin A2","SARS disease pathogenesis","SARS-CoV spike domain","SARS-induced cytokines interleukin","epithelial cell A549","human lung type","lung failure","A549 cell lysate","candidate proteins","increased surface expression","candidate autoantigens","Cytokine stimulation","cross-reactivity","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","highest score","infection","implications","confocal microscopic observation","Mascot data search","mass spectrometry analysis","proteomic studies","dose-dependent manner","atypical pneumonia","interferon-\u03B3","study","role"],"language":"en"},

It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had \u223C 10 times higher \u201Cferrocene hydroxylating\u201D activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes.","publish_time":"1991-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, J.

In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7\u20138%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges.","publish_time":"2011-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canuti, Marta; Eis-Huebinger, Anna Maria; Deijs, Martin; de Vries, Michel; Drexler, Jan Felix; Oppong, Samuel K.; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Klose, Stefan M.; Wellinghausen, Nele; Cottontail, Veronika M.; Kalko, Elisabeth K.

The search strategy comprised the following common search terms: hospital pneumonia OR nosocomial pneumonia OR noninvasive OR molecular diagnostic tests (OR point-of-care systems OR VOC [i.e. volatile organic compounds]) OR rapid (or simple or quick test), including brand names for the most common commercial tests. Expert opinion: In recent years, the microbiological diagnosis of respiratory pathogens has improved significantly by the development and implementation of molecular diagnostic tests for pneumonia. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, hybridization, and mass spectrometry-based platforms dominate the scene, with microarray-based assays, multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry capable of detecting the determinants of antimicrobial resistance (mainly \u03B2-lactamase genes). Introducing these assays into routine clinical practice for rapid identification of the causative microbes and their resistance patterns could transform the care of pneumonia, improving antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.","publish_time":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liapikou, Adamantia; Cill\u00F3niz, Catia; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0c38f13afabd1cadfc104f12344e79ea599cb74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103721.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2019.1635010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital pneumonia","care of pneumonia","nosocomial pneumonia","ventilator-associated pneumonia","microbiological diagnosis of hospital","common commercial tests","implementation of molecular diagnostic tests","microbiological diagnosis of respiratory pathogens","challenging diagnosis","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","following common search terms","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","mass spectrometry-based platforms","microarray-based assays","determinants of antimicrobial resistance","rapid identification","search strategy","antimicrobial selection","care systems","resistance patterns","respiratory failure","MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry capable","systematic literature review","hybridization","scene","causative microbes","brand names","recent years","routine clinical practice","critical illness","VOC","quick test","volatile organic compounds","severe sepsis","development","point","reference lists","\u03B2-lactamase genes","de-escalation","efforts","hand","additional studies","Expert opinion","Medline","Areas","stewardship","inception","Introduction"],"language":"en"},

This paper describes the first structural model of a complex between a picornaviral 3C(pro) and a region of the 5\u2032-UTR, stem-loop D (SLD). Using human rhinovirus as a model system, we have combined NMR contact information, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, and previous mutagenesis results to determine the shape, position and relative orientation of the 3C(pro) and SLD components. The results clearly identify a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, with pronounced loops from each molecule providing the key binding determinants for the interaction. Binding between SLD and 3C(pro) induces structural changes in the proteolytic active site that is positioned on the opposite side of the protease relative to the RNA/protein interface, suggesting that subtle conformational changes affecting catalytic activity are relayed through the protein.","publish_time":"2009-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Claridge, Jolyon K.; Headey, Stephen J.; Chow, John Y.H.; Schwalbe, Martin; Edwards, Patrick J.; Jeffries, Cy M.; Venugopal, Hariprasad; Trewhella, Jill; Pascal, Steven M.","journal":"J Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/054bf460b787cf391e804211223b1b0174095b30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172786.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847709000604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19268541/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847709000604; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2009.02.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR","SLD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic site","structural changes","protease relative","structural model","interaction","UTR region","binding stoichiometry","SLD components","principal viral protease","key binding determinants","catalytic activity","protein interface","relative orientation","model system","RNA genomes","viral genome","subtle conformational changes","proteolytic active site","previous mutagenesis results","SAXS","small-angle X-ray scattering","data","NMR contact information","shape","molecule","pronounced loops","target of numerous replication inhibitors","conserved mechanism","position","stem-loop D","complex","picornaviral","human rhinovirus","Picornaviruses","paper"],"language":"en"},

Whole genome sequencing identified 12 amino acid changes in the cold-adapted strain with no insertions and deletions throughout the genome. Animal inoculation experiments confirmed the attenuated phenotype of Aram-P29-CA virus in the natural host. Pregnant sows were orally administered P29-CA live vaccines two doses at 2-week intervals prior to parturition, and the newborn piglets were challenged with the parental virus. The oral homologous prime-boost vaccination of P29-CA significantly improved the survival rate of the piglets and notably mitigated the severity of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding after the challenge. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were detected in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows and in the sera of their offspring.

The results indicated that ionic liquids (ILs) showed remarkable effects on the extraction yield of isoflavones. In addition, the ILUAE, including several ultrasonic parameters, such as the concentration, extraction time and solvent to solid ratio have been optimized. Under these optimal conditions (e.g., with 30 min extraction time and the solvent to solid ratio of 30 ml/g), this approach gained the highest extraction yields of tectoridin (37.45 mg/g), iristectorin B (2.88 mg/g) and iristectorin A (5.28 mg/g).

Infections caused by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus range from mild upper respiratory tract syndromes to fatal diseases. However, studies comparing virological and immunological profile of different clinical severity are lacking. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 74 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection, including 23 patients who either developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died (ARDS-death group), 14 patients with desaturation requiring oxygen supplementation and who survived without ARDS (survived-without-ARDS group), and 37 patients with mild disease without desaturation (mild-disease group). We compared their pattern of clinical disease, viral load, and immunological profile. Results. Patients with severe disease were older, more likely to be obese or having underlying diseases, and had lower respiratory tract symptoms, especially dyspnea at presentation. The ARDS-death group had a slower decline in nasopharyngeal viral loads, had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and were more likely to have bacterial coinfections (30.4%), myocarditis (21.7%), or viremia (13.0%) than patients in the survived-without-ARDS or the mild-disease groups. Reactive hemophagocytosis, thrombotic phenomena, lymphoid atrophy, diffuse alveolar damage, and multiorgan dysfunction similar to fatal avian influenza A H5N1 infection were found at postmortem examinations. Conclusions. The slower control of viral load and immunodysregulation in severe cases mandate the search for more effective antiviral and immunomodulatory regimens to stop the excessive cytokine activation resulting in ARDS and death.","publish_time":"2010-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Kelvin K.

This survey was posted on Twitter. The survey remained open to polling for 48 hours. During this time, multiple gastroenterologists and fellows with prominent social media presence were tagged to disseminate the survey. Results The initial tweet had 38,795 impressions with a total of 2855 engagements. There was significant variation in responses from gastroenterologists regarding timing of endoscopy in these semi-urgent scenarios. There were only three of 16 scenarios for which more than 70 % of gastroenterologists agreed on procedure-timing . For example, significant variation was noted in regard to timing of upper endoscopy in patients with melena, with 44.5 % of respondents believing that everyone with melena should undergo endoscopic evaluation at this time. Similarly, about 35 % of respondents thought that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should only be performed in patients with choledocholithiasis with abdominal pain or jaundice. Conclusion Our analysis shows that there is currently lack of consensus among gastroenterologists in regards to timing of semi-urgent or non-life-threatening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results support the need for the ongoing development of societal guidance for these \u201Csemi-urgent\u201D scenarios to help gastroenterologists in making difficult triage decisions.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bilal, Mohammad; Simons, Malorie; Rahman, Asad Ur; Smith, Zachary L.; Umar, Shifa; Cohen, Jonah; Sawhney, Mandeep S.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Pleskow, Douglas K.","journal":"Endosc Int Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a40a9290896532f28fbd252716d4eb926b89edfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165009.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1153-9014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["survey gastroenterologists","urgent procedures","timing of semi-urgent","semi-urgent scenarios","elective endoscopic procedures","timing of endoscopy","multiple gastroenterologists","procedure-timing","elective procedures","COVID","question survey","pandemic","timing of upper endoscopy","urgency of endoscopic evaluation","common clinical scenarios","endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","emergent endoscopic interventions","patients","consensus","time-sensitive","significant variation","melena","respondents","Twitter","results","non-life-threatening procedures","fellows","prominent social media presence","ongoing development of societal guidance","authors","gastroenterology organizations","responses","regards","clear guidelines","impressions","choledocholithiasis","abdominal pain","need","middle ground","difficult triage decisions","total","jaundice","polling","definitions","initial tweet","engagements","hours","study","example","Methods","Conclusion","analysis","Background"],"language":"en"},

Humoral immune responses have been observed for most adjuvants and delivery platforms while only viral vectors, ISCOMs and Montanide\u2122 ISA 51 and 720 have shown cytotoxic T cell responses in the clinic. MF59 and MPL\u00AE have elicited Th1 responses, and virus-like particles, non-degradable nanoparticles and liposomes have also generated cellular immunity. Such vaccine components have also been evaluated for alternative routes of administration with clinical successes reported for intranasal delivery of viral vectors and proteosomes and oral delivery of a VLP vaccine.","publish_time":"2008-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peek, Laura J.; Middaugh, C.

B-cell lymphoma is unique in this context as tumor cells express TLR9 and may harbor latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma-herpesvirus with remarkable oncogenic potential when latent. Latent EBV may be promoted by TLR9 triggering via suppression of lytic EBV. Here, we elaborated an initial assessment of the impact of TLR9 triggering on EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma using Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma (BL) cell lines as an in vitro model. We show that, independent of the presence of EBV, the TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG-2006 may or may not induce caspase-dependent cell death in BL cells. Moreover, ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death responses of BL cells were associated with TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs5743836 or rs352140, which we detected in primary BL tumors and in peripheral blood from healthy individuals at similar frequencies. Thus, our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be determined as potential biological markers for the therapeutic response to treatment targeting innate immunity.","publish_time":"2012-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noack, J; Jordi, M; Zauner, L; Alessi, D; Burch, A; Tinguely, M; Hersberger, M; Bernasconi, M; Nadal, D","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05df6a79e61e69b9113ffa6a667c3fb9b2680e70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3388232.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2012.60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22717578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Toll-like","ODN","BL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TLR9 SNPs","impact of TLR9","Latent EBV","tumor cells express TLR9","BL patients","EBV-positive","presence of EBV","EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma","TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide","induced cell death responses of BL cells","effect of TLR9 agonists","cell lines","triggering","TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms","primary BL tumors","suppression of lytic EBV","caspase-dependent cell death","Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma","innate immunity","ODN CpG","adaptive immunity responses","latent Epstein-Barr virus","potential biological markers","remarkable oncogenic potential","peripheral blood","therapeutic response","context","gamma-herpesvirus","healthy individuals","cancer","treatment","promising novel strategy","similar frequencies","installment of therapy","rs352140","rs5743836","initial assessment","receptor","model","Toll","findings"],"language":"en"}]}

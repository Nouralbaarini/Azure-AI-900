Adenovirus infections can result in severe complications in some cases, such as in adenovirus type 11 infection in immunocompromised patients. However, effective treatment methods for adenovirus infections are currently unavailable. This prompted the search for antiviral agents effective against adenovirus infections. In the present study, adenovirus E1A was targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) using synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in an attempt to inhibit viral replication, since adenovirus E1A proteins are known to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the viral and cellular genes necessary for controlling the cell cycle and viral replication. The results indicated that the siRNAs effectively reduced the amount of adenovirus E1A mRNA and the levels of replicative intermediates. Additionally, siRNA-mediated gene silencing inhibited adenovirus replication by suppressing the E1A mRNA. These results suggest that the RNAi-mediated targeting of adenovirus E1A may have a potentially therapeutic effect in controlling adenovirus infections.","publish_time":"2007-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, Y.-S.; Kim, M.-K.; Lee, W.-J.; Kang, C.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afb50e56171bbf48d2be0fa0253923735e0e8a62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzgxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Adenovirus infections","adenovirus type","adenovirus E1A mRNA","adenovirus family","adenovirus E1A proteins","inhibited adenovirus replication","RNAi-mediated targeting of adenovirus E1A","viral replication","widespread respiratory tract infections","siRNAs","results","human adenoviruses","human serotypes","siRNA-mediated gene","antiviral agents effective","effective treatment methods","synthetic small interfering RNAs","cellular genes necessary","cell cycle","RNA interference","therapeutic effect","immunocompromised patients","cases","levels of replicative intermediates","search","attempt","severe complications","transcriptional activation","present study"],"language":"en"},

The chicks were vaccinated against IBV on the second day of life with the vaccine Ma5, but at the age of 18 days, they exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic lesions compatible with avian infectious bronchitis (IB). In the clinical disease stage, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the trachea, lungs, and small intestine of the chicks, while IBV variants were detected in the bursa of Fabricius and kidneys. Subsequently, new samples were collected from the same batch at the end of the production cycle. In this phase, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the kidneys, small intestine, and oviduct of the hens. However, a previously unidentified IBV variant was found in the cecal tonsils. Additionally, a fragment of viral RNA with that was completely identical to the corresponding region of the Ma5 vaccine was detected in the allantoic fluid of viable embryos from the hens under study after 18 days of incubation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the Ma5 vaccine, other strains of IBV variants can coexist, seeming to establish a chronic infection in the chickens, and that they can potentially be transmitted vertically. These results may assist in immunoprophylaxis control programs against IBV.

In this study, we demonstrate that persistently infected cells are very restricted in permissiveness for superinfection. By reconstitution experiments, using bovine brain gangliosides as artificial receptors, the degree of super-infection was markedly increased. Analysis of cellular receptor expression revealed reduced concentrations of sialoglycoproteins in general and a limited presentation of the major receptor gp40. Cocultures of persistently infected and uninfected cells (the latter carrying normal receptor levels) initiated a transient rise in virus titers. This kind of induction of virus synthesis appeared to be mainly receptor-linked, since a receptor-deprived subline, MDCK II, did not give rise to a similar effect. Susceptibility of MDCK II cocultures could be partly restored by ganglioside treatment. In accordance to related virus systems, these findings on influenza C virus suggest a role of cell receptor concentrations in the regulation of long-term persistence.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marschall, M.; Meier-Ewert, H.; Herrler, G.; Zimmer, G.; Maassab, H.

The WD-BCoV antigen was detected in the epithelium of the small and large intestines, nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. WD-BCoV RNA was detected in the serum from post-inoculation day 3.

Blood and sputum samples were collected upon admission. Compared to non-severe CAP patients, the severe CAP group showed higher plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines but in contrast, lower sputum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

While landscape epidemiology studies have shed light on many aspects of disease distribution and risk differentials across geographies, new computational methods combined with new data sources such as citizen sensors, global spatial datasets, sensor networks, and growing availability and variety of satellite imagery offer opportunities for a more integrated approach to understanding these relationships. Additionally, a large number of new modelling and mapping methods have been developed in recent years to support the adoption of these new tools. The complexity of this research context results in study-dependent solutions and prevents landscape approaches from deeper integration into operational models and tools. In this paper we consider three common research contexts for spatial epidemiology; surveillance, modelling to estimate a spatial risk distribution and the need for intervention, and evaluating interventions and improving healthcare. A framework is proposed and a categorization of existing methods is presented. A case study into leptospirosis in Sri Lanka provides a working example of how the different phases of the framework relate to real research problems. The new framework for geocomputational landscape epidemiology encompasses four key phases: characterizing assemblages, characterizing functions, mapping interdependencies, and examining outcomes. Results from Sri Lanka provide evidence that the framework provides a useful way to structure and interpret analyses. The framework reported here is a new way to structure existing methods and tools of geocomputation that are increasingly relevant to researchers working on spatially explicit disease-landscape studies.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robertson, Colin","journal":"GeoJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7cf02380d29527579f3ea6ba97b92835fd7e6c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087791.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sri Lanka"],"keyphrases":["new framework","new tools","new way","new computational methods","mapping methods","spatial epidemiology","landscape epidemiology studies","spatial risk distribution","new data sources","geocomputational landscape epidemiology","landscape approaches","explicit disease-landscape studies","large number of new modelling","categorization of existing methods","risk factors","risk differentials","aspects of disease distribution","Sri Lanka","research context results","tools of geocomputation","structure","global spatial datasets","infectious disease distributions","common research contexts","real research problems","key phases","different phases","mapping interdependencies","case study","useful way","characterizing assemblages","working example","study-dependent solutions","citizen sensors","sensor networks","geographies","growing availability","deeper integration","light","variety of satellite imagery","operational models","opportunities","functions","leptospirosis","need","evidence","surveillance","temporal scales","researchers","adoption","integrated approach","recent years","interventions","paper","analyses","complexity","environment impacts health"],"language":"en"},

The Hep B Free campaign was launched to eliminate HBV in San Francisco by increasing awareness, testing, vaccination and linkage to care. The campaign conducted 306 street intercept and telephone interviews of San Francisco Asians to assess current levels of HBV knowledge, testing behaviors and effectiveness of existing campaign media materials. One-third of respondents ranked HBV as a key health issue in the Asian community, second to diabetes. General HBV awareness is high (85%); however, a majority could not name an effective prevention method. Sixty percent reported having been tested for HBV; provider recommendation was the most often cited reason for testing. Respondents reported a high level of trust in their providers to correctly assess which health issues they may be at risk for developing and test accordingly, confirming that efforts to increase HBV testing among Asians must simultaneously mobilize the public to request testing and compel providers to test high-risk patients. Regarding community awareness, more than half reported hearing more about HBV recently; younger respondents were more likely to have encountered campaign materials and recall correct HBV facts. Assessment of specific campaign materials found that while upbeat images and taglines captured attention and destigmatized HBV, messages that emphasize the pervasiveness and deadly consequence of infection were more likely to drive respondents to seek education and testing. The campaign used survey results to focus efforts on more intensive provider outreach and to create messages for a new public outreach media campaign.","publish_time":"2011-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shiau, Rita; Bove, Fred; Henne, Jeff; Zola, Janet; Fang, Ted; Fernyak, Susan","journal":"J Community Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8265364e5ed0c62b7a2b72c565a8560a5f3c08a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087939.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hep B Free","HBV","General HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV testing","destigmatized HBV","General HBV awareness","correct HBV facts","testing behaviors","current levels of HBV knowledge","Assessment of specific campaign materials","effectiveness of existing campaign media materials","new public outreach media campaign","Hep B Free campaign","community awareness","younger respondents","messages","efforts","providers","reported hearing","telephone interviews of San Francisco Asians","intensive provider outreach","Asian community","health issues","provider recommendation","deadly consequence of infection","key health issue","chronic hepatitis B","high level of trust","attention","upbeat images","street intercept","taglines","pervasiveness","cited reason","survey results","fatal consequences","vaccination","linkage","education","effective prevention method","high-risk patients","majority","diabetes","percent"],"language":"en"},

Since the development of the first viral infectious clone system for the poliovirus, novel strategies of viral genome construction have allowed for the assembly of viral genomes across the identified viral families. However, the molecular profiles of some viruses make their genome more difficult to construct than others. Two factors that affect the difficulty of infectious clone construction are genome length and genome complexity. Results This work examines the available strategies for overcoming the obstacles of assembling the long and complex RNA genomes of coronaviruses and reports one-step construction of an infectious clone system for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae. Conclusions Future use of this methodology will shorten the time between emergence of a novel viral pathogen and construction of an infectious clone system. Completion of a viral infectious clone system facilitates further study of a virus\u2019s biology, improvement of diagnostic tests, vaccine production and the screening of antiviral compounds.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikiforuk, Aidan M.; Leung, Anders; Cook, Bradley W.M.; Court, Deborah A.; Kobasa, Darwyn; Theriault, Steven S.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bea1d1d130b407ba7382f561d3d193f6d9d646c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113859.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459876/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416303123; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416303123; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["viral gene","difficulty of infectious clone construction","novel strategies of viral genome construction","Abstract Background Viral Infectious clone systems","novel viral pathogen","assembly of viral genomes","identified viral families","genome length","genome complexity","reports one-step construction","study","available strategies","complex RNA genomes of coronaviruses","poliovirus","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","MERS-CoV","improvement of diagnostic tests","robust platforms","vaccine production","replicative function","reverse genetics","virus\u2019s biology","methodology","vaccines","emergence","wild type-virus","homologous recombination","screening of antiviral compounds","obstacles","time","Completion","animal host","Conclusions Future use","development","molecular profiles","cerevisiae","work","factors"],"language":"en"},

Following extensive consultation, they were first published in January 2001 1 and updated in 2007. 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective for the prevention of HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. The Department of Health commissioned a review of new evidence and we have updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the epic2 guidelines published in 2007 remain robust, relevant and appropriate, but some guideline recommendations required adjustments to enhance clarity and a number of new recommendations were required. These have been clearly identified in the text. In addition, the synopses of evidence underpinning the guideline recommendations have been updated. These guidelines (epic3) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospital and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice that need to be integrated into local practice guidelines and audited to reduce variation in practice and maintain patient safety. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of patient protection. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of health care in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loveday, H.

In early 2000, canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV\u20102c) was first reported and subsequently became a predominant subtype circulating in Europe and the Americas. CPV\u20102c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam. However, CPV\u20102c has never been reported in Thailand. In this study, we conducted viral enteric disease surveillance in dogs and cats in Thailand during 2016\u20132018. During 20 months of surveillance, 507 rectal swab samples were collected from dogs (n = 444) and cats (n = 63) with and without clinical signs. The samples were examined for parvovirus by using VP2 gene\u2010specific PCR for parvovirus. Our results showed that the positivity of canine parvovirus (CPV) was 29.95% and that of feline parvovirus (FPV) was 58.73%. In this study, we characterized 34 parvoviruses by VP2 gene sequencing. Moreover, two Thai\u2010CPV\u20102 (Dog/CU\u201024 and Cat/CU\u201021) were characterized by whole genome sequencing. The phylogenetic results showed that Thai\u2010CPV\u20102 had the highest nucleotide identities and clustered with Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c but were in separate subclusters from the North American and European CPV\u20102c.

In summary, our results demonstrated the emergence of Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c in dogs and cats in Thailand. Thus, the surveillance of CPV\u20102 in domestic dogs and cats should be further conducted on a larger scale to determine the dynamics of predominant variants and their distributions in the country and in the Southeast Asia region.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charoenkul, Kamonpan; Tangwangvivat, Ratanaporn; Janetanakit, Taveesak; Boonyapisitsopa, Supanat; Bunpapong, Napawan; Chaiyawong, Supassama; Amonsin, Alongkorn","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5152369ca35f473e81c7b07f277a7b6c3288ebe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887690/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","India","Taiwan","Vietnam","Thailand","Europe","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["surveillance of CPV","European CPV","cats","Canine parvovirus type","domestic dogs","feline parvovirus","positivity of canine parvovirus","Thailand","emergence of Asian","months of surveillance","VP2 gene sequencing","CU","phylogenetic results","study","genome sequencing","viral enteric disease surveillance","predominant subtype","genome analyses","rectal swab samples","dynamics of predominant variants","Southeast Asia region","haemorrhagic enteritis","country","China","important pathogen","highest nucleotide identities","separate subclusters","specific PCR","unique amino acids","India","Taiwan","cases","distributions","wildlife","parvoviruses","CPVs","Vietnam","positions","larger scale","Americas","summary","FPV","clinical signs"],"language":"en"},

However, many IBV outbreaks associated with respiratory distress, nephropathy, and high mortalities were attributed to the circulation of both classical and new nephropathogenic IBV variant 2 strains. In the present study, we report the development of attenuated IBV candidate vaccines using the classic IBV strains (IBM41 and IB2) and a nephropathogenic strain (IBvar2). The wild-type (WT) viruses were attenuated through serial passages in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Virulence of the attenuated viruses was then tested via the ocular route inoculation and the in vivo back passage in day-old SPF chickens. Efficacy against homologous challenge was investigated also in day-old SPF chickens. Results showed that the viruses were successfully adapted to the embryo by the 100th (IBM41 and IB2) and 110th passages (IBvar2). The attenuated viruses were safe and showed no change of virulence in day-old SPF chickens up to the 10th back passages. The efficacy experiment showed that the attenuated vaccines showed 90 to 100% protection against the homologous challenge based on ciliostasis score and protection percent. The att-IBM41 and att-IB2 vaccines were able to reduce the shedding of the challenge at 3 days post-infection (DPI) and no virus shedding was detected in both vaccinated groups by 5 DPI. In the att-IBvar2 vaccinated birds, only 20% of vaccinated birds shed the challenge virus with low titers (10(2.10\u00B10.3) EID(50)/mL) at 3 DPI. In conclusion, the attenuated strains IBM41, IB2, and IBvar2 are efficient vaccine candidates against currently circulating classic and variant IB viruses, respectively. Further studies to evaluate the field efficacy and combining these attenuated IBV strains to induce a wider protection against heterologous IBV challenge are suggested.","publish_time":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Ahmed; Kilany, Walid H; Zain El-Abideen, Mohamed A; Sayed, Magdy El; Elkady, Magdy","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58ed24ffb06bd86deebcf31ccf9bc5984b3d8703.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107197.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085298/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey312","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated IBV strains","attenuated viruses","attenuated vaccines","attenuated strains IBM41","classic IBV strains","heterologous IBV challenge","IBV outbreaks","variant IBV strain vaccines","development of attenuated IBV candidate vaccines","challenge virus","att-IB2 vaccines","new nephropathogenic IBV variant","homologous challenge","att-IBM41","day-old SPF chickens","variant IB viruses","att-IBvar2 vaccinated birds","virus shedding","wider protection","serial passages","protection percent","nephropathogenic strain","field efficacy","efficacy experiment","vaccinated groups","infectious bronchitis virus","change of virulence","embryonated specific pathogen free","respiratory distress","nephropathy","circulation","ciliostasis score","efficient vaccine candidates","high mortalities","chicken eggs","Vaccination programs","WT","Egypt","days post-infection","low titers","ocular route inoculation","wild-type","conclusion","present study","studies","Results","EID"],"language":"en"},

This study focuses on the social dilemma experienced by health care professionals and ways in which an interdisciplinary approach could be developed. RESULTS: Based on Gaertner and Dovidio\u2019s Common Ingroup Identity Model, a number of questionnaires were designed and tested; with PROGRESS, the relation between collaboration and common goal was assessed, mediated by decategorization, recategorization, mutual differentiation and knowledge sharing. This study confirms the Common Ingroup Identity Model stating that common goals stimulate collaboration. Decategorization and mutual differentiation proved to be significant in this relationship; recategorization and knowledge sharing mediate this relation. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the Common Ingroup Identity Model theory helps us to understand how health care professionals perceive the One Health initiative and how they can intervene in this process. In the One Health approach, professional associations could adopt a facilitating role.","publish_time":"2017-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eussen, Bj\u00F6rn G.M.; Schaveling, Jaap; Dragt, Maria J.; Blomme, Robert Jan","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38df3b1f635f3643d1a818ea62ac60915d71e92c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5470326.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1072-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Initiative","Common Ingroup Identity"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Health approach","health Initiative","veterinary health care professionals","Dovidio\u2019s Common Ingroup Identity Model","Common Ingroup Identity Model theory","common goals","collaboration","recategorization","need","mutual differentiation","knowledge sharing","decategorization","interdisciplinary approach","study","Gaertner","value","professional associations","social dilemma","ways","zoonotic diseases","comparative","outbreaks","relationship","number of questionnaires","translational medicine","facilitating role","RESULTS","PROGRESS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","process"],"language":"en"},

This discussion provides descriptions of these expressions through nurses who experienced the crisis and chose to go on the public record. Secondly, it compares the subjective perceptions of those nurses to those held by nurses who worked through historical epidemics of unknown or contested epidemiology. The historical literature on nursing in yellow fever, cholera and influenza epidemics has been employed to offer insight. The goal is to determine whether the SARS outbreak was a unique experience for nurses or whether similar experiences were shared by nurses in the past? In summary, the reactions of nurses when confronted with the possibility of contracting a deadly disease remain altogether human, not dissimilar in past or present.

This fusion process is mediated by at least three classes of fusion proteins (Class I, II, and III) based on the protein sequence and structure. For Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the glycoprotein Gc (Class II fusion protein) mediates this fusion event following entry into the endocytic pathway, allowing the viral genome access to the cell cytoplasm. Here, we show that peptides analogous to the RVFV Gc stem region inhibited RVFV infectivity in cell culture by inhibiting the fusion process. Further, we show that infectivity can be inhibited for diverse, unrelated RNA viruses that have Class I (Ebola virus), Class II (Andes virus), or Class III (vesicular stomatitis virus) fusion proteins using this single peptide. Our findings are consistent with an inhibition mechanism similar to that proposed for stem peptide fusion inhibitors of dengue virus in which the RVFV inhibitory peptide first binds to both the virion and cell membranes, allowing it to traffic with the virus into the endocytic pathway. Upon acidification and rearrangement of Gc, the peptide is then able to specifically bind to Gc and prevent fusion of the viral and endocytic membranes, thus inhibiting viral infection. These results could provide novel insights into conserved features among the three classes of viral fusion proteins and offer direction for the future development of broadly active fusion inhibitors.","publish_time":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koehler, Jeffrey W.; Smith, Jeffrey M.; Ripoll, Daniel R.; Spik, Kristin W.; Taylor, Shannon L.; Badger, Catherine V.; Grant, Rebecca J.; Ogg, Monica M.; Wallqvist, Anders; Guttieri, Mary C.; Garry, Robert F.; Schmaljohn, Connie S.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04cf308cfa2f72131ecbb07bacb894bab15aa66e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3772029.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["III","Rift Valley","RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion process","fusion event","classes of fusion proteins","classes of viral fusion proteins","active fusion inhibitors","stem peptide fusion inhibitors of dengue virus","Ebola virus","Andes virus","viral infection","RVFV infectivity","RVFV inhibitory peptide","viral envelope","RVFV Gc stem region","vesicular stomatitis virus","glycoprotein Gc","cell membranes","rearrangement of Gc","endocytic pathway","endocytic membranes","single peptide","viral genome access","Rift Valley fever virus","cell culture","cell cytoplasm","enveloped viruses","productive infection","protein sequence","unrelated RNA viruses","cellular membrane","future development","conserved features","binds","direction","inhibition mechanism similar","peptides analogous","novel insights","virion","entry","traffic","results","findings","structure","acidification"],"language":"en"},

Essential oils (EOs), because of their volatility, can easily reach both the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the antibacterial evaluation of clove, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, scots pine, peppermint, and citronella EOs against respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the antibacterial effect of these EOs in two different test systems to provide data for the development of an appropriate product formulation. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined with in vitro vapor phase test (VPT) and broth macrodilution test (BDT). The chemical and percentage compositions of the EOs were determined by GC-MS and GC-FID analysis. RESULTS: Among the EOs, thyme was the most effective against S. mutans (MIC: 0.04 mg/mL in BDT, but cinnamon bark and clove oils also presented high inhibition in liquid medium with MIC values of 0.06 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively. M. catarrhalis was the most sensitive to thyme EO (MIC: 0.09 mg/mL). Cinnamon bark EO was the most effective against Haemophilus spp. (MIC: 0.06 mg/mL). In the VPT, cinnamon bark was the most effective oil against all investigated pathogens with MIC values in the range of 15.62\u201390 \u03BCl/L. Surprisingly, the eucalyptus and scots pine showed weak activity against the test bacteria in both test systems. CONCLUSIONS: The EO of thyme, clove and cinnamon bark may provide promising antibacterial activity against respiratory tract pathogens either in liquid medium or in vapor phase. However, their effect is lower than that of the reference antibiotics. The combination of EOs and antibiotics may be beneficial in the alternative treatment of respiratory tract diseases. In vivo studies are necessary to calculate the effective dose of EOs in patients and determine their possible side effects and toxicity.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1cs, Kamilla; Bal\u00E1zs, Vikt\u00F3ria L.; Kocsis, B\u00E9la; Bencsik, T\u00EDmea; B\u00F6sz\u00F6rm\u00E9nyi, Andrea; Horv\u00E1th, Gy\u00F6rgyi","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6d9d71d7a16885f268b86b5b8291bffa869ce43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6064118.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053847/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2291-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","S. mutans","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["MIC","EO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract pathogens","Cinnamon bark EO","citronella EOs","effective dose of EOs","MIC values","combination of EOs","test bacteria","thyme EO","EO of thyme","case of respiratory tract diseases","alternative treatment of respiratory tract diseases","vapor phase test","different test systems","clove oils","effective oil","antibacterial effect","antibacterial evaluation of clove","broth macrodilution test","investigated pathogens","promising antibacterial activity","liquid medium","eucalyptus","scots pine","VPT","mutans","pyogenes","BDT","minimum bactericidal concentration","Minimum inhibitory concentration","weak activity","resistant bacteria","alternative treatments","GC-MS","Haemophilus influenzae","lower parts","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Essential oils","reference antibiotics","Moraxella catarrhalis","GC-FID analysis","high inhibition","peppermint","increasing number of multidrug","development","continuous need","fact of antibiotic resistance","parainfluenzae","data","patients","present study","infections","MBC","METHODS","range","appropriate product formulation","effects","BACKGROUND","percentage compositions","inhalation","toxicity","aim","\u03BCl","studies","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","volatility"],"language":"en"},

Influenza disease presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting although highly pathogenic forms exist. Neutrophils increase in the respiratory tract during infection with mild seasonal IAV, moderate and severe epidemic IAV infection, and emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). During severe influenza pneumonia and HPAI infection, the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract is correlated with disease severity.

Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide\u2014a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells\u2014and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell\u2014of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50\u201360 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm.

The shared outcome of spongiform degeneration in these diverse diseases suggests that common cellular mechanisms must underlie the processes of spongiform change and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues reveals increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity in and around areas of spongiform change, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration. The link between aberrant ubiquitination and spongiform neurodegeneration has been strengthened by the discovery that a null mutation in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger-1 (Mgrn1) causes an autosomal recessively inherited form of spongiform neurodegeneration in animals. Recent studies have begun to suggest that abnormal ubiquitination may alter intracellular signaling and cell functions via proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent mechanisms, leading to spongiform degeneration and neuronal cell death. Further elucidation of the pathogenic pathways involved in spongiform neurodegeneration should facilitate the development of novel rational therapies for treating prion diseases, HIV infection, and other spongiform degenerative disorders.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whatley, Brandi R.; Li, Lian; Chin, Lih-Shen","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/293764fc1b3e0187aedfe3bdee51283fbe59ddc4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6229de5da2f5e1fe77b7d702feabc57f70bef1b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2612938.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443908001592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18790052/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2612938?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.08.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443908001592","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration","processes of spongiform change","areas of spongiform change","inherited form of spongiform neurodegeneration","Canavan\u0027s spongiform leukodystrophy","spongiform degenerative disorders","shared outcome of spongiform degeneration","HIV infection","involvement of ubiquitin","diverse diseases","proteasome-dependent","proteasome-independent mechanisms","proteasome system dysfunction","hallmark of prion diseases","neuronal cell death","neuronal death","increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity","central nervous system","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","nervous tissue","cell functions","aberrant ubiquitination","abnormal ubiquitination","common cellular mechanisms","E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger","diffuse Lewy body disease","human immunodeficiency virus","development of novel rational therapies","Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues","Mgrn1","vacuolation","null mutation","brains of patients","pathology","pathogenic pathways","animals","link","gliosis","discovery","elucidation","Recent studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated. In vitro translation studies coupled with protease digestion suggest that gp65 is an integral membrane protein. The presence of gp65 in the virion is correlated with the presence of an acetylesterase activity. No hemagglutinin activity was detected.","publish_time":"1989-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yokomori, Kyoko; La Monica, Nicola; Makino, Shinji; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289905813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289905813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycosylation of gp65","presence of gp65","endoglycosidase treatment of gp65","carbohydrate chains of gp65","peptide backbone of gp65","potential glycosylation sites of gp65","virion structural protein","integral membrane protein","size","pulse-chase periods","Pulse-chase experiments","Partial endoglycosidase treatment","biosynthetic pathway","maturation pathway","Golgi complex","acetylesterase activity","hemagglutinin activity","virus-infected cells","different strains of mouse hepatitis virus","quantity","possible biological activities","trimming","protease digestion","MHV","E3","E1","tunicamycin","translation studies","study","transport","N-glycosidic linkage","E2 glycoproteins","interpretation","monensin","cotranslational"],"language":"en"},

We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) \u2014a homologue of ACE\u2014to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzik, Tomasz J; Mohiddin, Saidi A; Dimarco, Anthony; Patel, Vimal; Savvatis, Kostas; Marelli-Berg, Federica M; Madhur, Meena S; Tomaszewski, Maciej; Maffia, Pasquale; D\u2019Acquisto, Fulvio; Nicklin, Stuart A; Marian, Ali J; Nosalski, Ryszard; Murray, Eleanor C; Guzik, Bartlomiej; Berry, Colin; Touyz, Rhian M; Kreutz, Reinhold; Wang, Dao Wen; Bhella, David; Sagliocco, Orlando; Crea, Filippo; Thomson, Emma C; McInnes, Iain B","journal":"Cardiovasc Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d09e194306a1d65ccf7289138eb5b4b9e0f30a7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197627.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular system","Cardiovascular considerations of therapies","cardiovascular risk","clinical course of COVID","myocardial dysfunction","cardiac damage","cardiac injury","rapid progression phase of COVID","endothelial dysfunction","microvascular dysfunction","ventricular fibrillation","chronic pulmonary disease","Risk of severe infection","ACE inhibitors","transmembrane angiotensin","mortality","comorbidities","experimental therapies","future therapies","patients","SARS-CoV","severe cytokine storm","angiotensin receptor blockers","human recombinant ACE2","novel coronavirus disease","pulmonary embolism","social isolation","atrial fibrillation","ventricular tachyarrhythmia","social distancing","hs-cTnI","myocardial infarction","aldosterone system","intravascular coagulation","homologue of ACE","common complications","mechanistic considerations","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","plaque instability","hypertension","fulminant myocarditis","interstitial pneumonitis","levels","inflammatory responses","ARDS","evidence","diabetes","heart failure","advancing age","ribavirin","interferons","macrophages","S protein","hydroxychloroquine","tocilizumab","type","pneumocytes","creatine kinase","ARBs","hospitalization","RAAS","sensitive troponin","NT-proBNP","perivascular pericytes","serine protease","Preventive measures","proteolytic cleavage","D-dimer","ritonavir","remdesivir","viral invasion","interleukin","lungs","outbreak","male sex","comprehensive review","multiple organs","greatest medical challenge","decades","cardiomyocytes","lopinavir","prognosis","rhACE2","renin","cancer","enzyme","Early evaluation"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the effect of glycyrrhizin on pseudomonal skin infections was studied in a chimera model of thermal injury. Two different chimera models were utilized. Patient chimeras were created in murine antimicrobial peptide-depleted NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03B3(null) mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with the same patient peripheral blood CD31(\u002B) IMC. Patient chimera substitutes were created in the same mice that were grafted with NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31(\u002B) IMC. In the results, both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin resisted a 20 LD(50) dose of P. aeruginosa skin infection, while all chimeras in both groups treated with saline died within 3 days of the infection. Human antimicrobial peptides were detected from the grafted site tissues of both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin, while the peptides were not detected in the same area tissues of controls. HBD-1 was produced by keratinocytes in transwell-cultures performed with CD31(\u002B) IMC and glycyrrhizin. Also, inhibitors (IL-10 and CCL2) of HBD-1 production by keratinocytes were not detected in cultures of patient CD31(\u002B) IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from pseudomonal grafted site infections in a chimera model of burn injury is controllable by glycyrrhizin.

Summary In addition to the psychological impact of quarantine, there are sleep disturbances that must be taken into account by implementing appropriate strategies in order to maintain good mental and general health. Quarantine can disrupt sleep first in impacting circadian rhythms by decreasing the intensity of zeitgebers, second can promote insomnia in this period of acute stress and third can be a source of sleep deprivation in those on the front line and managing the crisis. In addition, in children/adolescents, confinement can also destructure the days and thus have an impact on overall health. For this, it is important to put in place strategies to prevent these sleep disturbances in order to reduce the psychological, infectious impact and deal optimally with this situation that we are all experiencing.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guichard, K.; Geoffroy, P.

This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost-effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross-infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using a number of different ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air return arrangement used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recommended that the newly identified ventilation parameters be widely adopted in the design of new hospital general wards to minimise cross-infection. The proposed ventilation system can also be retrofitted in existing hospital general wards with far less disruption and cost than a full-scale refurbishment.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yam, R.; Yuen, P.

We suggest that the putative allosteric binding site may be a novel target for future therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2015-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Bo-Kyoung; Cho, Joong-Heui; Jeong, Pyeonghwa; Lee, Youngjin; Lim, Jia Jia; Park, Kyoung Ryoung; Eom, Soo Hyun; Kim, Yong-Chul","journal":"FEBS Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0dc610bca854aedf96d7c5fc13796c2d1a805b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094222.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579315004214; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579315004214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26022398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benserazide","novel inhibitor","novel putative allosteric binding site","Cpro","novel target","encoded Coxsackievirus","Abstract Coxsackievirus B3","non-competitive inhibitor","viral proliferation","enzyme kinetic studies","FRET-based enzyme assay","main cause of human viral myocarditis","analogs","drug library screen","chemical structure","key pharmacophore","electrophilic functional groups","enzyme\u2019s inhibitory activity","cardiomyopathy","future therapeutic strategies","essential role","C protease","molecular docking study","trihydroxybenzyl moiety"],"language":"en"},

The past three decades have seen outbreaks of diseases caused by parvoviruses, Nipah virus, circoviruses, and prions. Infectious pathogens such as these are formidable opponents; they can adapt to new hosts or cause variant diseases within new hosts. Many are also resistant to current inactivation techniques. In order to prevent or contain outbreaks, pathogens that emerge must be identified quickly and efficiently; research and ongoing global surveillance are therefore of primary importance. To effectively protect the blood supply and blood-based therapies, this research should include investigations into improved techniques for detection, screening, and viral inactivation, as well as into ways to reduce patient exposure to infectious pathogens via therapeutic agents.

Whereas interactions at the protein level are well explored, RNA interactions are less so. Novel sequencing methodologies have helped uncover the importance of RNA\u2013protein and RNA\u2013RNA interactions during infection. In addition to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), mammalian cells express a great number of regulatory non-coding RNAs, some of which are crucial for regulation of the immune system whereas others are utilized by viruses. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that RNA interactions play important roles for both sides in the arms race between virus and host. With the emerging field of RNA therapeutics, such interactions are promising antiviral targets. In this review, we discuss direct and indirect RNA interactions occurring between RNA viruses or retroviruses and host non-coding transcripts upon infection. In addition, we review RNA virus derived non-coding RNAs affecting immunological and metabolic pathways of the host cell typically to provide an advantage to the virus. The relatively few known examples of virus\u2013host RNA interactions suggest that many more await discovery.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damas, Nkerorema Djodji; Fossat, Nicolas; Scheel, Troels K.

These observations suggest that the oncogene may play a role in the immune system.","publish_time":"1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Guan-Jie; Colombo, Lucas L.; Lopez, Maria C.; Watson, Ronald R.","journal":"Cancer Letters","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304383593902363; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0304383593902363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","FBV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ras oncogene","tumor necrosis factor","TNF production","inbred FVB mice","Inbred Oncomice","Abstract Mice","FBV mice","cells","activated v-Ha","mouse mammary tumor virus promoter","IFN release","enhancer","significant difference","\u03B3-interferon","decrease","role","identical animals","immune system","tendency","Splenocytes","observations","months"],"language":"en"},

This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1\u03B2, -6, and TNF-\u03B1) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I IFN response, the theoretical role of IL-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe COVID-19 (i.e. interleukin-1\u03B2-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jamilloux, Yvan; Henry, Thomas; Belot, Alexandre; Viel, S\u00E9bastien; Fauter, Maxime; El Jammal, Thomas; Walzer, Thierry; Fran\u00E7ois, Bruno; S\u00E8ve, Pascal","journal":"Autoimmun Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21c3701ab292a847ca07c8654d6e3c63f00f023b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196557.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997220301294?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568997220301294","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","JAK"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["interleukin","severe COVID","pathophysiology of COVID","number of cytokine","clinical trials","interferon response","anti-cytokine therapies","impaired type","defective type","benign disease","coronavirus disease","TNF inhibitors","so-called cytokine storm","IFN response","current evidence","targeted therapies","severe form","JAK inhibitors","TNF-\u03B1","\u03B2-driven macrophage activation syndrome","overview of current knowledge","inception of numerous fundamental research protocols","corticosteroids","theoretical role of IL","scientists","context","chloroquine","concomitant immunodeficiency","vast majority of cases","clinicians","fatal outcomes","review","immunopathology","pandemic","extraordinary challenges","unprecedented situation","world","Cytokines","lymphocyte repertoire","lymphopenia","immune dysregulation","patterns","characteristic","China"],"language":"en"},

We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio","journal":"Eur Phys J Plus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3db88b442b2c693d0783756c733c55bcec669df0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156796.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00383-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of positive cases","number of daily cases","number of daily positive cases","number of fits","cumulative number of fatalities","Italy","number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID","number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs","number of relevant issues","day","cumulative distribution function","official data","time","China","available data","Gauss error function","type","mathematical predictions","potential evolution","Gaussian distribution","change","statistical prediction","statistical approach","substantial decrease","substantial attenuation","above-mentioned peak","robust prediction","heuristic approach","social distancing","parameters","integral","account","use","pandemic","models of contamination diffusion","Monte Carlo simulations","derivative","consistent results","acceleration","deceleration","sign","paper","flex"],"language":"en"},

In seven patients, also follow-up samples were investigated for abundance and dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation. Five eukaryotic and two prokaryotic virus families were identified in BAL, and nine eukaryotic and two prokaryotic families in plasma. Anelloviruses were the most abundant in both compartments, followed by Herpes- and Coronaviruses. Virus abundance was significantly higher in LTRs than in healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p\u003C0.001). Up to 48 different anellovirus strains were identified within a single LTR. Analyses in the follow-up patients revealed for the first time a highly complex and unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains in the posttransplantation period. The abundance of anelloviruses in plasma was inversely correlated with that of other eukaryotic viruses (Pearson correlation coefficient r = \u22120.605; p\u003C0.05). A broad spectrum of virus strains co-exists in BAL and plasma of LTRs. Especially for the anelloviruses, a high degree of co-infections and a highly individual and complex dynamics after transplantation was observed. The biological impact of these findings and their relation to clinical variables remain to be elucidated by future analyses.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Segura-Wang, Maia; G\u00F6rzer, Irene; Jaksch, Peter; Puchhammer-St\u00F6ckl, Elisabeth","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d72eff2e42d11208c2844ebfdf2eb87e7942cccb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6034876.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29979780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus abundance","plasma of LTRs","dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation","complex dynamics","eukaryotic viruses","BAL","prokaryotic virus families","plasma samples","abundance of anelloviruses","unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains","different anellovirus strains","broad spectrum of virus","non-pathogenic viruses","posttransplantation period","follow-up samples","prokaryotic families","human virome","different compartments","follow-up patients","severe infections","high degree of co-infections","clinical variables","future analyses","clinical outcome of lung transplant recipients","healthy controls","withdrawn bronchoalveolar lavage","metagenomic sequencing","important role","Pearson correlation coefficient r","Kruskal-Wallis test","findings","potential markers","time","level of immunosuppression","complexity","biological impact","single LTR","Herpes","study","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability.

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Birger, Ruthie; Morita, Haruka; Comito, Devon; Filip, Ioan; Galanti, Marta; Lane, Benjamin; Ligon, Chanel; Rosenbloom, Daniel; Shittu, Atinuke; Ud-Dean, Minhaz; Desalle, Rob; Planet, Paul; Shaman, Jeffrey","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ffbca7e7e60e13461801769ad70f770879d0f81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6041500.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00249-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29997120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shedding of respiratory virus","parainfluenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus transmission","high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus","observation of human respiratory virus carriage","testing positive","predictive of virus positivity","IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses","asymptomatic prevalence","recruited participants","selection of common respiratory viruses","rates of asymptomatic shedding","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","half of participants","symptomatic infections","role of asymptomatic infection","human populations","symptoms","New York City tourist attraction","medical surveillance","ambulatory population","proportion of infections","medical history","medical records","adenovirus","demographics","ambulatory adult population","symptomatic fraction","data available","total infected population","definition of symptomatic infection","seasonal arms","coronavirus","Hispanic ethnicity data","prediction of positivity","nasal swabs","precise estimates","summer arm","Nasopharyngeal swabs","winter arm","control methods","significant levels of morbidity","alternative sampling methods","survey information","symptom severity score","visitors","members","age category","swab specimens","slight differences","recent travel","adults","surveys","best-fit model","multiplex PCR","recruitment","symptomology","samples","HRV","broad range","distribution","individuals","CoV","Analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

Over the past decades, accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in innate immunity. However, the involvement of host lncRNAs in hantaviral control remains uncharacterized. In this study, we identified the lncRNA NEAT1 as a vital antiviral modulator. NEAT1 was dramatically upregulated after Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection, whereas its downregulation in vitro or in vivo delayed host innate immune responses and aggravated HTNV replication. Ectopic expression of NEAT1 enhanced beta interferon (IFN-\u03B2) production and suppressed HTNV infection. Further investigation suggested that NEAT1 served as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. HTNV infection activated NEAT1 transcription through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway, whereas NEAT1 removed the transcriptional inhibitory effects of the splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ) by relocating SFPQ to paraspeckles, thus promoting the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. RIG-I and DDX60 had synergic effects on IFN production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NEAT1 modulates the innate immune response against HTNV infection, providing another layer of information about the role of lncRNAs in controlling viral infections. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses have attracted worldwide attention as archetypal emerging pathogens. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key regulators of innate immunity; however, their roles in hantavirus infection remain unknown. In the present work, a new unexplored function of lncRNA NEAT1 in controlling HTNV replication was found. NEAT1 promoted interferon (IFN) responses by acting as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. This lncRNA was induced by HTNV through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway in a time- and dose-dependent manner and promoted HTNV-induced IFN production by facilitating RIG-I and DDX60 expression. Intriguingly, NEAT1 relocated SFPQ and formed paraspeckles after HTNV infection, which might reverse inhibitive effects of SFPQ on the transcription of RIG-I and DDX60. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the regulatory role of the lncRNA NEAT1 in host innate immunity after HTNV infection. In summary, our findings provide additional insights regarding the role of lncRNAs in controlling viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Hongwei; Han, Peijun; Ye, Wei; Chen, Hesong; Zheng, Xuyang; Cheng, Linfeng; Zhang, Liang; Yu, Lan; Wu, Xing\u0027an; Xu, Zhikai; Lei, Yingfeng; Zhang, Fanglin","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d18636f47e3c7dd93da309d556ba464d964fd24f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5391460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202761/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02250-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTNV","SFPQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NEAT1 transcription","suppressed HTNV infection","expression of RIG","Hantavirus infection","transcription of RIG","HTNV-induced IFN production","aggravated HTNV replication","role of lncRNAs","host innate immunity","new unexplored function of lncRNA NEAT1","DDX60 expression","Ectopic expression of NEAT1 enhanced beta interferon","involvement of host lncRNAs","key regulators of innate immunity","innate immune response","inhibitive effects of SFPQ","IFN-\u03B2","long noncoding RNAs","delayed host","immune responses","key regulatory roles","synergic effects","IRF7 pathway","positive feedback","findings","viral infections","study","transcriptional inhibitory effects","accumulating evidence","formed paraspeckles","splicing factor proline","worldwide attention","zoonotic diseases","glutamine-rich protein","dose-dependent manner","high mortality rate","time","hantaviral control","additional insights","archetypal emerging pathogens","humans","present work","vital antiviral modulator","layer of information","downregulation","Hantaan virus","IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses","past decades","global public health concern","summary","knowledge","investigation","best"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND: Emerging infectious diseases remain an underlying source of global health concern. Guidelines for accident and emergency departments would require adjustments for infectious disease management. However, disparities between guidelines and nurses\u0027 practice are frequently reported, which undermines the implementation of these guidelines into practice. This article explores the experience of frontline emergency nurses regarding guideline implementation and provides an in\u2010depth account of their strategies in bridging guideline\u2010practice gaps. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: Semi\u2010structured, face\u2010to\u2010face, individual interviews were conducted between November 2013\u2013May 2014. A purposive sample of 12 frontline emergency nurses from five accident and emergency departments in Hong Kong were recruited. The audio\u2010recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with a qualitative content analysis approach. RESULTS: Four key categories associated with guideline\u2010practice gaps emerged, including getting work done, adapting to accelerated infection control measures, compromising care standards and resolving competing clinical judgments across collaborating departments. The results illustrate that the guideline\u2010practice gaps could be associated with inadequate provision of corresponding organisational supports after guidelines are established. CONCLUSIONS: The nurses\u0027 experiences have uncovered the difficulties in the implementation of guidelines in emergency care settings and the corresponding strategies used to address these problems. The nurses\u0027 experiences reflect their endeavour in adjusting accordingly and adapting themselves to their circumstances in the face of unfeasible guidelines. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is important to customise guidelines to the needs of frontline nurses. Maintaining cross\u2010departmental consensus on guideline interpretation and operation is also indicated as an important component for effective guideline implementation.","publish_time":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Stanley KK; Kwong, Enid WY; Hung, Maria SY; Pang, Samantha MC","journal":"J Clin Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/515325f7188a9d6b3b1e79e22cea05f3d6582155.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27507678/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.13343","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["implementation of guidelines","emergency departments","practice gaps","nurses\u0027 practice","effective guideline implementation","guideline interpretation","CLINICAL PRACTICE","experience of frontline emergency nurses","emergency care settings","face of unfeasible guidelines","needs of frontline nurses","corresponding strategies","nurses\u0027 experiences","accident","difficulties","RESULTS","qualitative descriptive design","care standards","important component","individual interviews","recorded interviews","Emerging infectious diseases","competing clinical judgments","infectious disease management","qualitative content analysis approach","inadequate provision of corresponding organisational supports","adjustments","underlying source of global health concern","departmental consensus","operation","infection control measures","key categories","in\u2010depth account","Hong Kong","purposive sample","audio","BACKGROUND","circumstances","work","article","disparities","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","endeavour","problems","RELEVANCE","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Recently, virulent systemic diseases caused by FCV infection has been associated with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently, there are no direct-acting antivirals approved for the treatment of FCV infection. Here, we tested 15 compounds from different antiviral classes against FCV using in vitro protein and cell culture assays. After the expression of FCV protease-polymerase protein, we established two in vitro assays to assess the inhibitory activity of compounds directly against the FCV protease or polymerase. Using this recombinant enzyme, we identified quercetagetin and PPNDS as inhibitors of FCV polymerase activity (IC(50) values of 2.8 \u03BCM and 2.7 \u03BCM, respectively). We also demonstrate the inhibition of FCV protease activity by GC376 (IC(50) of 18 \u00B5M). Using cell culture assays, PPNDS, quercetagetin and GC376 did not display antivirals effects, however, we identified nitazoxanide and 2\u2032-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) as potent inhibitors of FCV replication, with EC(50) values in the low micromolar range (0.6 \u03BCM and 2.5 \u03BCM, respectively).

A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination.

This phenomenon was independent of either viral replication or the proliferation of infected cells and could not be compromised by neutralizing antibody. Neither extracellular vesicles nor the direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections between adjacent cells contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. Further genome-wide transcriptional profile analyses in combination with functional validation identified fatty acid metabolism as an essential molecular event during modulation of the intercellular spread and subsequent cytopathic effect of ILTV by Src.

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival. Methods We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. Findings Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of three/six months would cause attributable death of 4,755/10,760 of these individuals with loss of 92,214/208,275 life-years. For cancer surgery, average life-years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of three/six months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of three/six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482,022 LYGs requiring of 1,052,949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs. Interpretation Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of three/six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of life-years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sud, Amit; Jones, Michael; Broggio, John; Loveday, Chey; Torr, Bethany; Garrett, Alice; Nicol, David L.; Jhanji, Shaman; Boyce, Stephen A.; Gronthoud, Firza; Ward, Phillip; Handy, Jonathan M.; Yousaf, Nadia; Larkin, James; Suh, Yae-Eun; Scott, Stephen; Pharoah, Paul D.P.; Swanton, Charles; Abbosh, Christopher; Williams, Matthew; Lyratzopoulos, Georgios; Houlston, Richard; Turnbull, Clare","journal":"Annals of Oncology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/372a10e95cb3369cb829e063d0c14e4b2fa74a61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442581/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923753420398252?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923753420398252","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["life years","cancer surgery","patient delay","average life-years","months","resource-adjusted life-years","patient long-term survival","stage-specific cancer survival","surgery results","average loss","RALYGs","hospital COVID","Abstract Background Cancer diagnostics","equivalent volumes of COVID","healthcare resource costing","day hazard ratios of cancer progression","Progression of cancers","account units of healthcare resource","downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths","major cancers","standard conditions","incident cancers","Hospitalisation of community","equivalent volume of admissions","response of healthcare services","attributable lives","long-term survivors","attributable death","significant impact","surgical pathways","observational studies","normal throughput","Interpretation Modest delays","rapid attention","resections","individuals","England","periods of disruption","patients","hospitalisations","backlog","Methods","Findings","pandemic","HCRUs"],"language":"en"},

Fifty-nine episodes of URI occurred in 56 residents during the study period. Serologic testing or virus isolation proved or suggested an etiologic agent on 22 occasions. URI was more common in late Fall and Winter and was caused by various agents, including influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses. A minor outbreak of influenza B in February 1986 contrasted with previous cases of URI in that the patients had a higher mean temperature and abnormal breath sounds, and they were clinically sicker. This suggests that clinical and epidemiologic surveillance during the influenza season may allow the early recognition of influenza in elderly nursing home residents. Over a 4-year period 147 serum antibody responses after influenza infection or influenza vaccination were compiled. Antibody responses to individual influenza vaccine components were measured 75 to 90 days after vaccination. The geometric mean titer (GMT) and the percentage of samples with antibody levels \u2A7E 1:40 were determined for each of the three antigenic subtypes on 3 consecutive years. The GMT to individual vaccine components was consistently greater than 1:40, except to influenza B/Singapore in 1984 and A/Chile and B/U.S.S.R. in 1985, when these subtypes were first included in the vaccine, suggesting the NHCU residents responded less vigorously to unfamiliar vaccine subtypes. In 1984 the GMT to A/Phillippines of unvaccinated NHCU residents without URI was surprisingly no different from the corresponding GMT of their vaccinated counterparts, raising the possibility that an influenza A/Phillippines outbreak in 1983 conferred herd immunity.","publish_time":"1988-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arroyo, Julio C.; Jordan, Wanda; Milligan, Lloyd","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0196655388900260; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196655388900260","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URI","NHCU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","influenza vaccination","influenza season","individual influenza vaccine components","minor outbreak of influenza B","early recognition of influenza","episodes of URI","Abstract Residents","previous cases of URI","Phillippines of unvaccinated NHCU residents","individual vaccine components","unfamiliar vaccine subtypes","elderly nursing home residents","corresponding GMT","serum antibody responses","Phillippines outbreak","antibody levels","antigenic subtypes","respiratory syncytial virus","virus isolation","consecutive months","year period","consecutive years","study period","development of upper respiratory tract infection","Veterans Administration nursing home care unit","higher mean temperature","geometric mean titer","frequency of sporadic cases of outbreaks","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","abnormal breath sounds","Winter","patients","various agents","percentage of samples","vaccinated counterparts","conferred herd immunity","parainfluenza viruses","late Fall","epidemiologic surveillance","possibility","etiologic agent","Serologic testing","Singapore","occasions","Chile","days","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

In immunocompromised patients a bronchoalveolar lavage has to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus and some adenovirus. The immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays, which detect viral antigens in the infected cells are the easiest and fastest diagnostic methods, theoretically. As with other techniques, specimen quality is a major determinant of their performance. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults. Then the virus recovery by cell culture, which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays, can be helpful. Many studies have reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as PCR. They detect viruses, which are missed by conventional methods and increase the detection of common respiratory virus. Multiplex PCR assays have been developed, and these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens. Nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype-specific primers, and analyse strain variation through genetic. It can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens. More recently real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed to get more rapidly the results of the nucleic acids assays. Specimen quality, timing and transportation conditions may be less critical for nucleic acid testing than for culture or antigen detection, as viable virus and intact infected cells need not to be preserved. Moreover, viral nucleic acids are detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus, potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late-presenting patients. However, in a clinical virology laboratory, where the speed, low cost, and high sensitivity of the methods are required, the sequential use of antigen detection tests and multiplex PCR could be the best choice, particularly in the clinical setting of respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in ICU.

In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.","publish_time":"2012-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zaikun; Waeckerlin, Regula; Urbanowski, Matt D.; van Marle, Guido; Hobman, Tom C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbc89603600968ee09dd4b38c91616f83f7e0bba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3359987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22655077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV infection","tight junction complexes","infection of polarized cells","subset of tight junction membrane proteins","endothelial cells","significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins","WNV infected epithelial","Dengue virus","results","barrier function of tight junctions","number of polarized cell layers","common route of infection","West Nile virus","hemorrhagic flaviviruses","neurotropic flaviviruses","host cell environment","number of recent studies","organ tissue","serious neurological disease","systemic infections","access","trans-cellular movement of macromolecules","GTPase dynamin","related flavivirus","human","mosquito bites","endocytosis","claudin","microtubule-based transport","central nervous system","pathogen","animals","Resistance","implications","blood","JAM","intracellular mechanism","molecular basis","lysosomal degradation","neuroinvasion","present study","process"],"language":"en"},

External biosecurity is particularly important in North America camelid operations due to the extensive movement of animals for breeding or show purposes. Internal biosecurity typically involves this the prevention and treatment of failure of passive transfer, maintenance of proper nutrition and housing, and the implementation of an appropriate vaccination program for endemic or relevant diseases. Attention to appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures related to housing, feeding, and treatment equipment is important for the maintenance of both internal and external biosecurity practices.

This work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with PCV2-spiked semen, six vaccinated (V group) and six unvaccinated (NV group) against PCV2, 29 and 53 days post infection (DPI). An immunohistochemical investigation for IgA-, IgG- and IgM-antibody bearing plasma cells (PCs) was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs. Plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 DPI. The IgA, IgG and IgM PC density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in PC density was identified from duodenum to ileum. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 PC density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment: the amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs remained constant, 10.55 \u00B1 4.24 and 10.06 \u00B1 5.01 at 29 DPI and 53 DPI, respectively. In the V group a significant increase in PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs was observed over time. The amounts of PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs increased from 9.37 \u00B1 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 \u00B1 15.83 at 53 DPI. The data on IgA, IgM and IgG PC counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs. The sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibody-secreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a \u201Cbooster-like\u201D response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals. After virus challenge, vaccination induced an increase in the number of PCs containing specific anti-PCV2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa.","publish_time":"2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bianco, C.; Felice, V.; Panarese, S.; Marrocco, R.; Ostanello, F.; Brunetti, B.; Muscatello, L.V.; Leotti, G.; Vila, T.; Joisel, F.; Sarli, G.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23620ceeefafccfc6107a477f1c24d1cfa0fafee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126026.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016524271400138X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961900/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016524271400138X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.05.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgG PC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs","amounts of PCV2","specific antibody-secreting PCs","anti-PCV2 PC density","IgM-antibody","specific anti-PCV2 antibodies","amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody","number of PCs","IgM PC density","PCV2-spiked semen","sandwich method","NV group","IgG PC counts","sandwich immunohistochemical method","significant increase","Plasma cell density","intestinal samples","Intestinal immune response","unvaccinated animals","groups of animals","level of intestinal mucosa","immunohistochemical investigation","plasma cells","reference values","important defensive role","formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues","sampling moment","foecal","crypts","vaccination","gilts","decreasing trend","technique able","oro-faecal route","population of adult pigs","parts of intestine","modulation","pathogens","villus","virus challenge","demonstration","practical application","duodenum","data","days post infection","work","booster","ileum","time"],"language":"en"},

In recent decades, medicinal plants have been gaining wider acceptance due to the perception that these plants, as natural products, have fewer side effects and improved efficacy compared to their synthetic counterparts. Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Licorice) is a small perennial herb that has been traditionally used to treat many diseases, such as respiratory disorders, hyperdipsia, epilepsy, fever, sexual debility, paralysis, stomach ulcers, rheumatism, skin diseases, hemorrhagic diseases, and jaundice. Moreover, chemical analysis of the G. glabra extracts revealed the presence of several organic acids, liquirtin, rhamnoliquirilin, liquiritigenin, prenyllicoflavone A, glucoliquiritin apioside, 1-metho-xyphaseolin, shinpterocarpin, shinflavanone, licopyranocoumarin, glisoflavone, licoarylcoumarin, glycyrrhizin, isoangustone A, semilicoisoflavone B, licoriphenone, and 1-methoxyficifolinol, kanzonol R and several volatile components. Pharmacological activities of G. glabra have been evaluated against various microorganisms and parasites, including pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and Plasmodium falciparum, and completely eradicated P. yoelii parasites. Additionally, it shows antioxidant, antifungal, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities.

In the face of these complex issues, risk assessments supported by quantitative information would facilitate evidence-based decision making. We propose a conceptual model for disease transmission risk analysis, inclusive of these multiple other facets. To quantify several processes included in this conceptual model we conducted questionnaire surveys with wildlife consumers and vendors in semi-urban centers in Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) and direct observations of consumer behaviors. Direct observation of market stalls indicated an estimated average of 10 kg bushmeat biomass per stall per hour. The socio-demographic data suggested that consumption of bushmeat in urban areas was not for subsistence but rather driven by dietary preference and tradition.

To date, no effective medical therapy has been established for overt rabies. The rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is a serial vaccination against rabies starting as soon as possible after the patient was bitten by a suspected rabid animal, is the only way to prevent death. In Japan, no rabies case has been reported for about 50 years. However, rabies is epizootic in many Asian countries, where more than 50% of the rabies deaths in the world occur. The Japanese travelers who visit these countries every year may not be aware of this fact since no rabies occurs in their own country. Therefore, the risk of being bitten by a rabid animal abroad and developing rabies after returning to Japan seems to be high. All medical staff should keep in mind that imported rabies cases can occur at any time. In addition, pre-exposure vaccination against rabies should be recommended to international travelers in order to ensure the preventative effect of PEP.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takayama, Naohide","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47e1aad5a9e693ef01ea170449855b6539867600.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18297443/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10156-007-0573-0; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X08707979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X08707979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEP"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["Abstract Rabies","overt rabies","rabies deaths","imported rabies cases","rabies post-exposure prophylaxis","years","pre-exposure vaccination","suspected rabid animal","Asian countries","international travelers","medical staff","Japanese travelers","serial vaccination","effective medical therapy","preventative effect of PEP","mind","order","typical zoonotic disease","addition","date","way","patient","world","time","fact","risk","country"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN A literature review of the historical costs of surgical fellowship interviews and a summary of how the shift to virtual interviews has unintended positive and negative effects on costs for applicants and training programs. RESULTS Transitioning fellowship interviews to virtual platforms affects expenditures of finances and time. Each fellowship candidate saves close to $6,000 in interview travel expenses. Applicants require less time off from their residency programs during this critical time of need for frontline healthcare workers. However, applicants miss some of the live aspects of interviewing, and training programs invest more effort upfront altering their interviews to virtual formats. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 public health crisis has had a significant impact on surgical education, including how selection is conducted. Virtual recruitment has the potential for cost savings but should continue to be refined. This is an opportune time to innovate and rethink how to recruit prospective surgical residency and fellowship candidates during the current and forthcoming interview seasons.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Jennifer","journal":"Journal of Surgical Education","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a505fcf5c17d2b7d286074d5a82899286f6e7335.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931720420301537?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931720420301537; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.05.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virtual interviews","historical costs of surgical fellowship interviews","surgical fellowship interview process","fellowship candidates","applicants","virtual platforms","surgical education","Virtual recruitment","residency programs","training programs","virtual formats","opportune time","prospective surgical residency","critical time of need","forthcoming interview seasons","interview travel expenses","effect of COVID","negative effects","significant impact","public health crisis","shift","rethink","expenditures of finances","summary","frontline healthcare workers","live aspects of interviewing","potential","RESULTS","effort","cost savings","literature review","CONCLUSIONS","Abstract OBJECTIVE","selection"],"language":"en"},

To refine our understanding of how human social behaviour may change over time, we conducted a longitudinal study of Hong Kong residents. We recorded the social contact patterns for 1450 individuals, up to four times each between May 2012 and September 2013. We found individuals made contact with an average of 12.5 people within 2.9 geographical locations, and spent an average estimated total duration of 9.1 h in contact with others during a day. Distributions of the number of contacts and locations in which contacts were made were not significantly different between study waves. Encounters were assortative by age, and the age mixing pattern was broadly consistent across study waves. Fitting regression models, we examined the association of contact rates (number of contacts, total duration of contact, number of locations) with covariates and calculated the inter- and intra-participant variation in contact rates. Participant age was significantly associated with the number of contacts made, the total duration of contact and the number of locations in which contact occurred, with children and parental-age adults having the highest rates of contact. The number of contacts and contact duration increased with the number of contact locations. Intra-individual variation in contact rate was consistently greater than inter-individual variation. Despite substantial individual-level variation, remarkable consistency was observed in contact mixing at the population scale. This suggests that aggregate measures of mixing behaviour derived from cross-sectional information may be appropriate for population-scale modelling purposes, and that if more detailed models of social interactions are required for improved public health modelling, further studies are needed to understand the social processes driving intra-individual variation.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Kin On; Cowling, Ben; Wei, Vivian; Riley, Steven; Read, Jonathan M.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a1c74872d4e0aa20076dc1f3970d9ff42991847.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5805989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367241/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0838","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["contact duration","number of contact locations","contact mixing","Patterns of social contact","social contact patterns","total duration of contact","highest rates of contact","association of contact rates","number of contacts","number of locations","Intra-individual variation","inter-individual variation","intra-participant variation","social processes","population scale","individuals","Participant age","geographical locations","substantial individual-level variation","human social behaviour","average estimated total duration","study waves","detailed models of social interactions","population-scale modelling purposes","parental-age adults","patterns of immunity","aggregate measures of mixing behaviour","longitudinal study of Hong Kong residents","Fitting regression models","improved public health modelling","remarkable consistency","cross-sectional information","studies","pathogens","transmission","people","covariates","children","understanding","Encounters","Distributions","times","day"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal patterns of HRV types over four consecutive years in one geographic region. HRV identified in respiratory samples from 114 patients over a four-year period were analysed by VP4/VP2 sequencing. HRV-A was found in 64, HRV-B in 11 and HRV-C in 37 cases. Overall, 33 different HRV-A types, nine B types and 21 C types were found. As many as 21 of the HRV types appeared during several seasons, with a maximum time-span of four years. Some types appeared during successive seasons and, in some cases, phylogenetic analysis indicated extended periods of circulation locally. Most of the strains were closely related to HRV identified in other parts of the world during the same time period. HRV strains that circulate locally represent many types and seem to reflect that HRV infections are highly globalised. The existence of simultaneous or successive epidemics with different HRV types in combination with the ability of each type to remain in the local population over extended periods of time may contribute to explaining the high rate of HRV infections.","publish_time":"2013-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sansone, M.; Andersson, M.; Brittain-Long, R.; Andersson, L.-M.; Olofsson, S.; Westin, J.; Lindh, M.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efbe521865a20bd71c15272710e545213acd61cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087832.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23435753/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-013-1832-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different HRV types","HRV-B","HRV-C","HRV strains","seasonal patterns of HRV types","B types","C types","high rate of HRV infections","time period","extended periods of time","successive epidemics","cases","successive seasons","seasonal epidemics","extended periods of circulation","maximum time-span","consecutive years","respiratory samples","four-year period","major cause of acute respiratory tract infection","combination","phylogenetic analysis","local population","prevalent pathogen","VP4","patients","existence of simultaneous","ability","study","geographic region","viral ARTIs","world","seasonality","VP2 sequencing","Human rhinovirus","parts","aim","months"],"language":"en"},

These methods cannot be applied to the detection of emerging diseases for which no preexisting information is available. This paper presents a method aimed at facilitating the detection of outbreaks, when there is no a priori knowledge of the clinical presentation of cases. METHODS: The method uses a visual representation of the symptoms and diseases coded during a patient consultation according to the International Classification of Primary Care 2(nd )version (ICPC-2). The surveillance data are transformed into color-coded cells, ranging from white to red, reflecting the increasing frequency of observed signs. They are placed in a graphic reference frame mimicking body anatomy. Simple visual observation of color-change patterns over time, concerning a single code or a combination of codes, enables detection in the setting of interest. RESULTS: The method is demonstrated through retrospective analyses of two data sets: description of the patients referred to the hospital by their general practitioners (GPs) participating in the French Sentinel Network and description of patients directly consulting at a hospital emergency department (HED). Informative image color-change alert patterns emerged in both cases: the health consequences of the August 2003 heat wave were visualized with GPs\u0027 data (but passed unnoticed with conventional surveillance systems), and the flu epidemics, which are routinely detected by standard statistical techniques, were recognized visually with HED data. CONCLUSION: Using human visual pattern-recognition capacities to detect the onset of unexpected health events implies a convenient image representation of epidemiological surveillance and well-trained \u0022epidemiology watchers\u0022.

A good understanding of the current status and issues of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in naturally ventilated urban buildings and the association with urban microclimate is fundamental for improving their IEQ. This paper reviews past studies on (a) the microclimate in urban street canyons, (b) the potential influence of such microclimate on IEQ of nearby naturally ventilated buildings, and (c) the real-life IEQ status in these buildings. The review focuses mainly on studies conducted by on-site measurements. The microclimate in urban street canyons is characterized by low wind speed, high surface temperature difference, high pollutant concentration, and high noise level. Insufficient ventilation rates and excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants are two key risks involved in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Existing knowledge suggests that reasonable urban planning and careful building envelope design are the primary methods to ensure acceptable IEQ and maximize the utilization of natural ventilation. However, quantitative studies of both microclimate in street canyons and IEQ in buildings are still highly insufficient in many aspects, which make cross comparison and influencing factors analysis currently impossible. Based on the limitations of previous studies and the current issues of naturally ventilated urban buildings, suggestions are made for future studies to better understand and improve IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ai, Z.

Recently, we have demonstrated that an ORF 1b-encoded 100-kDa protein is proteolytically cleaved from the 1a/1b fusion polyprotein by a viral-specific proteinase of the picornavirus 3C proteinase group (3C-like proteinase). In this report, the 3C-like proteinase has been further analysed by internal deletion of a 2.3-kb fragment between the 3C-like proteinase-encoding region and ORF 1b and by substitution mutations of its catalytic centre as well as the two predicted cleavage sites flanking the 100-kDa protein. The results show that internal deletion of ORF 1a sequences from nucleotide 9911 to 12227 does not influence the catalytic activity of the proteinase in processing of the 1a/1b polyprotein to the 100-kDa protein species. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed that the predicted nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys2922) and a histidine residue encoded by ORF 1a from nucleotide 8985 to 8987 (His2820) are essential for the catalytic activity of the proteinase, and that the QS(G) dipeptide bonds are its target cleavage sites. Substitution mutations of the third component of the putative catalytic triad, the glutamic acid 2843 (Glu2843) residue, however, do not affect the processing to the 100-kDa protein. In addition, cotransfection experiment shows that the 3C-like proteinase is capable of trans-cleavage of the 1a/1b polyprotein. These studies have confirmed the involvement of the 3C-like proteinase domain in processing of the 1a/1b polyprotein, the predicted catalytic centre of the proteinase, and its cleavage sites.","publish_time":"1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, D.

In the course of developing these guidelines it was clear that a framework for regional and/or national BVD control would be required to increase the uptake of BVD control at farm level and reduce the overall prevalence of the disease. This paper assessed the economic impact of BVD, epidemiological aspects of the disease to its control, models of BVD control, international experiences of BVD control programmes. The technical knowledge and test technology exists to eradicate BVD. Indeed, many countries have successfully and others are embarking on control of the disease. The identification and prompt elimination of PI cattle will form the basis of any control programme. The trade of such animals must be curtailed. Pregnant and potentially pregnant carrying PI foetuses pose a significant threat. International experience indicates systematic, well coordinated programmes have the most success, while voluntary programmes can make good initial progress but ultimately fail. The farming community must buy into any proposed programme, and without their support, failure is likely. To buy into the programme and create such a demand for BVD control, farmers must first be well informed. It is likely that stemming economic loss and improving productivity will be the primary motivator at individual farm level.","publish_time":"2011-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrett, Damien J; More, Simon J; Graham, David A; O\u0027Flaherty, Joe; Doherty, Michael L; Gunn, H Michael","journal":"Ir Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea81809febb5da9242f91f23bc9e2fa4bfdeed6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3199273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967764/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-0481-64-12","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bovine Viral Diarrhoea","BVD","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["models of BVD control","national BVD control","uptake of BVD control","international experiences of BVD control programmes","economic impact of BVD","control of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea","disease","clear guidelines","voluntary programmes","coordinated programmes","proposed programme","individual farm level","PI foetuses","prompt elimination of PI cattle","economic loss","Irish cattle herds","infection","epidemiological aspects","primary motivator","productivity","good initial progress","identification","Animal Health Ireland","framework","support","test technology","success","overall prevalence","farmers","basis","demand","significant threat","technical knowledge","paper","farming community","failure","trade","animals","course","countries"],"language":"en"},

Historically, however, drug discovery has focused mainly on viral targets, because of their perceived specificity. Efforts to pursue host targets have been largely hampered by concern over potential on-target toxicity, the lack of predictive cell culture and animal models, and the complexity of host\u2013virus interactions. On the other hand, there are distinct advantages of targeting the host, such as creating a high barrier to resistance, providing broad coverage of different genotypes/serotypes and possibly even multiple viruses, and expanding the list of potential targets, when druggable viral targets are limited. Taking hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the example, there are more than 20 inhibitors of the viral protease, polymerase and NS5A protein currently in advanced clinical testing. However, resistance has become a main challenge with these direct-acting antivirals, because HCV, an RNA virus, is notoriously prone to mutation, and a single mutation in the viral target may prevent the binding of an inhibitor, and rendering it ineffective. Host cyclophilin inhibitors have shown promising effects both in vitro and in patients to prevent the emergence of resistance and to cure HCV infection, either alone or in combination with other agents. They are also capable of blocking the replication of a number of other viral pathogens. While the road to developing host-targeting antivirals has been less traveled, and significant challenges remain, delivering the most effective antiviral regimen, which may comprise inhibitors of both host and viral targets, should be well worth the effort.","publish_time":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Kai; Gallay, Philippe","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce121dd29cce7ce2ca5903fd1a377338ad7861ce.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4210d5be0750187855ef2b8c1d92c5f1db43285d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4332838.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4332838?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354213000831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23578729/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213000831","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host targets","druggable viral targets","viral protease","viral pathogens","complexity of host","antiviral targets","Host cyclophilin inhibitors","viral life cycle","list of potential targets","HCV infection","RNA virus","emergence of resistance","virus interactions","hepatitis C virus","target toxicity","single mutation","direct-acting antivirals","effective antiviral regimen","NS5A protein","serotypes","lack of predictive cell culture","animal models","polymerase","broad coverage of different genotypes","promising effects","main challenge","advanced clinical testing","patients","high barrier","concern","multiple viruses","replication","distinct advantages","number","step","binding","perceived specificity","significant challenges","drug discovery","combination","hand","example","Efforts","agents"],"language":"en"},

Identification of the immune effectors responsible for injuring the brain during acute infection is necessary for the development of therapeutic strategies that reduce neuropathology but maintain immune control of the virus. METHODS: The identity of brain-infiltrating leukocytes was determined using microscopy and flow cytometry at several acute time points following intracranial infection of mice with the Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus. Behavioral consequences of immune cell depletion were assessed by Morris water maze. RESULTS: Inflammatory monocytes, defined as CD45(hi)CD11b(\u002B\u002B)F4/80(\u002B)Gr1(\u002B)1A8(-), and neutrophils, defined as CD45(hi)CD11b(\u002B\u002B\u002B)F4/80(-)Gr1(\u002B)1A8(\u002B), were found in the brain at 12 h after infection. Flow cytometry of brain-infiltrating leukocytes collected from LysM: GFP reporter mice confirmed the identification of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the brain. Microscopy of sections from infected LysM:GFP mice showed that infiltrating cells were concentrated in the hippocampal formation. Immunostaining confirmed that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were localized to the hippocampal formation at 12 h after infection. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils but not of neutrophils only resulted in preservation of hippocampal neurons. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes also preserved cognitive function as assessed by the Morris water maze. CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes rapidly and robustly responded to Theiler\u0027s virus infection by infiltrating the brain. Inflammatory monocytes preceded neutrophils, but both cell types were present in the hippocampal formation at a timepoint that is consistent with a role in triggering hippocampal pathology. Depletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils with the Gr1 antibody resulted in hippocampal neuroprotection and preservation of cognitive function. Specific depletion of neutrophils with the 1A8 antibody failed to preserve neurons, suggesting that inflammatory monocytes are the key effectors of brain injury during acute picornavirus infection of the brain. These effector cells may be important therapeutic targets for immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing or preventing central nervous system pathology associated with acute viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howe, Charles L; LaFrance-Corey, Reghann G; Sundsbak, Rhianna S; LaFrance, Stephanie J","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6694490cc1353addf66465e4d06419ff0b0af753.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3368782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22405261/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-9-50","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Morris"],"organizations":["Neutrophils"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes","acute infection","identification of neutrophils","acute viral infection","identity of brain","acute picornavirus infection","hippocampal formation","Flow cytometry of brain","Specific depletion of neutrophils","Theiler\u0027s virus infection","intracranial infection of mice","hippocampal pathology","hippocampal neuroprotection","preservation of hippocampal neurons","key effectors of brain injury","infiltrating leukocytes","infiltrating cells","GFP mice","Gr1 antibody","1A8 antibody","acute time points","GFP reporter mice","immune effectors responsible","Behavioral consequences of immune cell depletion","Neuropathology","preservation of cognitive function","immune control","Morris water maze","CD45","CD11b","F4","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","development of therapeutic strategies","infected LysM","cell types","effector cells","Microscopy of sections","important therapeutic targets","central nervous system pathology","development of persistent neurological deficits","immunosuppressive therapies","role","timepoint","BACKGROUND","Immunostaining","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Due to the sporadic occurrence of the Ebola infection, there is insufficient research regarding how the United States emergency nurses provide care to patients potentially infected with the Ebola virus and the nurses\u2019 motivation to protect themselves when providing care to these patients. This study was aimed to investigate the predictors of emergency room nurse\u2019s protection motivation. Method A cross-sectional design was employed in the study. A survey developed based on a modified Protection Motivation Theory was administered to randomly selected emergency room nurses who are members of the Emergency Nurses Association. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test (as well as post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni test), Spearman Rho correlation, and Stepwise Multiple Linear regression were conducted for data analysis. Result Protection motivation was found in two components: proactive and passive protection motivation. The regression analysis indicated that response efficacy (\u03B2=.27, p\u003C.001) and self-efficacy (\u03B2=.17, p\u003C.01) significantly predict emergency nurses\u2019 proactive protection motivation, while perceived vulnerability (\u03B2=.26, p\u003C.001), response cost (\u03B2=.19, p=.001) and knowledge (\u03B2=-.15, p\u003C.01) significantly predict emergency nurses\u2019 passive protection motivation. Conclusion Results indicate the need for interventions to improve emergency nurses\u2019 response efficacy, self-efficacy, and knowledge, while simultaneously reducing the nurses\u2019 perceived vulnerability and response cost. Such interventions would be expected to proactively motivate nurses to protect themselves when providing care to patients that exhibit the signs and symptoms of an Ebola infection and reduce their passive protection motivation.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leigh, Laurasona; Taylor, Colleen; Glassman, Tavis; Thompson, Amy; Sheu, Jiunn-Jye","journal":"J Emerg Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b6c121367723023ac757265b4b0f40bce5c8bf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200349.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176720301495?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176720301495","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["Protection Motivation Theory","Emergency Nurses Association","Stepwise Multiple Linear"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["nurses\u2019 motivation","emergency nurses\u2019 passive protection motivation","emergency nurses\u2019 proactive protection motivation","Result Protection motivation","emergency nurses\u2019 response efficacy","predictors of emergency room nurse\u2019s protection motivation","modified Protection Motivation Theory","Emergency Nurses Association","United States emergency nurses","selected emergency room nurses","Ebola infection","self-efficacy","nurses\u2019 perceived vulnerability","response cost","patients","care","Ebola virus","regression analysis","interventions","knowledge","study","West African Ebola outbreak","data analysis","Dunn-Bonferroni test","Stepwise Multiple Linear regression","nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test","Spearman Rho correlation","members","components","insufficient research","need","signs","Descriptive statistics","symptoms","cross-sectional design","Conclusion Results","sporadic occurrence","Abstract Introduction","Method","survey"],"language":"en"},

The immaturity of the developing immune system, and particularly the distinct functionality of T lymphocytes in early life, has been implicated in increased susceptibility to infection. Previous work has demonstrated that immune responses in early life are skewed toward limited inflammation and atopy; however, there is mounting evidence that such responses are context- and tissue-dependent. The regulation, differentiation, and maintenance of infant T cell responses, particularly as it relates to tissue compartmentalization, remains poorly understood. How the tissue environment impacts early-life immune responses and whether the development of localized protective immune memory cell subsets are established is an emerging area of research. As infectious diseases affecting the respiratory and digestive tracts are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in infants and young children, a deeper understanding of site-specific immunity is essential to addressing these challenges. Here, we review the current paradigms of T cell responses during infancy as they relate to tissue localization and discuss implications for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.","publish_time":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zens, Kyra D.; Connors, Thomas; Farber, Donna L.","journal":"Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea16cb3708a425a5933434d80dd23f60803f36aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5743209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28894935/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-017-0648-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["life immune responses","early life","developing immune system","maintenance of infant T cell responses","current paradigms of T cell responses","tissue localization","tissue-dependent","tissue compartmentalization","tissue environment impacts","development of localized protective immune memory cell subsets","distinct functionality of T lymphocytes","development of vaccines","protected environment","digestive tracts","mortality","deeper understanding of site-specific immunity","infancy","young children","leading cause of morbidity","infants","wide variety of innocuous antigens","dangerous pathogens","differentiation","implications","limited inflammation","context","transitioning","infectious diseases","emerging area of research","immaturity","Previous work","increased susceptibility","infection","challenges","atopy","regulation","therapeutics","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Here, we aim to clarify clinical-pathological and/or molecular features of this tumour subgroup through a systematic review coupled with a comparative analysis with existing databases, also providing indications for a correct approach to the clinical identification of MSI/dMMR pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). DESIGN: PubMed, SCOPUS and Embase were searched for studies reporting data on MSI/dMMR in PDAC up to 30 November 2019. Histological and molecular data of MSI/dMMR PDAC were compared with non-MSI/dMMR PDAC and with PDAC reference cohorts (including SEER database and The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network - TCGA project). RESULTS: Overall, 34 studies with 8323 patients with PDAC were included in the systematic review. MSI/dMMR demonstrated a very low prevalence in PDAC (around 1%\u20132%). Compared with conventional PDAC, MSI/dMMR PDAC resulted strongly associated with medullary and mucinous/colloid histology (p\u003C0.01) and with a KRAS/TP53 wild-type molecular background (p\u003C0.01), with more common JAK genes mutations. Data on survival are still unclear. CONCLUSION: PDAC showing typical medullary or mucinous/colloid histology should be routinely examined for MSI/dMMR status using specific tests (immunohistochemistry, followed by MSI-PCR in cases with doubtful results). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) should be adopted either where there is limited tissue or as part of NGS tumour profiling in the context of precision oncology, acknowledging that conventional histology of PDAC may rarely harbour MSI/dMMR.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luchini, Claudio; Brosens, Lodewijk A A; Wood, Laura D; Chatterjee, Deyali; Shin, Jae Il; Sciammarella, Concetta; Fiadone, Giulia; Malleo, Giuseppe; Salvia, Roberto; Kryklyva, Valentyna; Piredda, Maria L; Cheng, Liang; Lawlor, Rita T; Adsay, Volkan; Scarpa, Aldo","journal":"Gut","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2f3e81f4d92b553f4be13a82aa9b1ed70ba2ebe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSI","PDAC","SEER","The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network","JAK","NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dMMR PDAC","conventional PDAC","molecular data of MSI","MSI-PCR","non-MSI","conventional histology of PDAC","dMMR status","clinical identification of MSI","PDAC reference cohorts","dMMR pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","molecular features","molecular setting","colloid histology","studies","systematic review","NGS tumour profiling","TP53 wild-type molecular background","tumour subgroup","clinical-pathological","doubtful results","SEER database","Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network - TCGA project","immunohistochemistry","defective DNA mismatch repair","context of precision oncology","specific tests","comparative analysis","Embase","microsatellite instability","correct approach","indications","existing databases","SCOPUS","KRAS","tumours","cases","success of immunotherapy","low prevalence","common JAK genes mutations","DESIGN","PubMed","CONCLUSION","limited tissue","OBJECTIVE","generation sequencing","survival","patients"],"language":"en"},

A total of 322 bovine fecal samples were collected from calves aged less than three months at 48 bovine farms in Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures. At farm A, 20 calves were selected and sampled weekly for 12 weeks (184 samples); at farm B, 10 calves were selected and sampled for five weeks (50 samples); and at the rest of the 46 farms, 88 calves were sampled once. The screening on the 358 field samples proved positive for 27 RVA, 4 BToV, 55 BEV, and 52 BCV. In the successive sampling, RVA was detected once but not continuously, whereas BEV and BCV were detected in succession for up to five weeks. The results revealed that RVA was the primary agent among the positive samples obtained from calves aged three weeks or less, while BEV was the primary among those from the older than three weeks old.

Viruses induce the production of interferon (IFN), which after binding to the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor (IFNAR), and triggering of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, results in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs function to inhibit viral replication and to regulate the host immune response. Among these ISGs, the ubiquitin-like molecule, ISG15, is one of the most strongly induced proteins. Similar to ubiquitin, through an IFN induced conjugation cascade, ISG15 is covalently linked to a variety of cellular proteins, suggesting regulation of different cellular processes. Studies performed over the past several years have shown that ISG15 plays a central role in the host\u2019s antiviral response against many viruses. Mice lacking ISG15 display increased susceptibility to multiple viruses. Furthermore, several viruses have developed immune evasion strategies that directly target the ISG15 pathway. Work is now underway to determine the mechanism by which ISG15 functions as an antiviral molecule, such that therapies targeting this pathway can be developed in the future.","publish_time":"2010-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lenschow, Deborah J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40afe56736a9733a103c22570b574165d7d38edd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994614/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v2102154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK/STAT","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISG15 pathway","ISG15 functions","multiple viruses","IFN-\u03B1","induction of interferon","interferon system","IFN induced conjugation cascade","antiviral molecule","production of interferon","ubiquitin","induced proteins","ISGs function","host\u2019s antiviral response","variety of cellular proteins","host immune response","critical role","central role","viral replication","immune evasion strategies","spread of viral infection","regulation of different cellular processes","results","increased susceptibility","\u03B2 receptor","stimulated genes","IFNAR","JAK","STAT","type","past","years","mechanism","Mice","therapies","binding","Studies","Work","future"],"language":"en"},

Sensitive and accurate detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV is necessary for clinical diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: A locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based multiplex closed one-tube nested real-time RT-PCR (mOTNRT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV. The sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance of mOTNRT-PCR were evaluated and compared with individual real time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using clinical samples. The analytical sensitivity of mOTNRT-PCR assay was 5 copies/reaction for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay were between 0.51 to 3.67%. Of 398 nasopharyngeal aspirates samples tested, 109 (27.39%), 150 (37.69%) and 44 (11.06%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, whereas 95 (23.87%), 137 (34.42%) and 38 (9.55%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, by individual RT-qPCR assay. Thirty three samples that were positive by mOTNRT-PCR but negative by RT-qPCR were confirmed as true positives by sequencing using reported traditional two-step nested PCR assay.

METHODS: We described demographics and clinical characteristics of all cases considered for PHTR because of suspected or confirmed communicable disease from May 22, 2007, to December 31, 2015. RESULTS: We reviewed 682 requests for PHTR; 414 (61%) actions were completed to place 396 individuals on PHTR.

However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.","publish_time":"2015-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Szu-Chi; Lin, Huan-Chun; Liu, Tzu-Ming; Lu, Jen-Tang; Hung, Wan-Ting; Huang, Yu-Ru; Tsai, Yi-Chun; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Chen, Shih-Yuan; Sun, Chi-Kuang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcb1c4ac23381ffb7dbeaad05aa5307cf4386912.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4673452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26647655/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep18030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus structure","virus inactivation","airborne virus","microwave-based virus epidemic prevention","previous virus-microwave interaction studies","structure-resonant energy transfer effect","microwaves power threshold","open public","reasonable microwave power density safe","new epidemic prevention strategy","induced inactivation","good agreement","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","residual viral infectivity of influenza","confined-acoustic dipolar mode","pathway","experiments","different frequencies","theoretical model","powers","frequency","results"],"language":"en"},

The ranking order was very similar to that obtained with an affinity ELISA, (an equilibrium system) but as others have found, affinities were 2\u201310-fold lower as measured by SPR (a flow system). No data were obtained with mAb HC58 although it had one of the highest affinities using an ELISA format, and was 28-fold higher than another mAb (HC10) which gave good data by SPR. This may relate to the orientation of its binding on the virion surface. The K dissoc. of the Fabs was only 3\u201310-fold higher compared to their IgGs. Fab from the lowest affinity IgG (HC10) could not be measured, possibly because it fell below the threshold for detection.","publish_time":"1996-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schofield, D.

METHODS: We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (\u00B1SD) age of the patients was 64\u00B118 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7\u00B14 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 237 children, ages 3 months to 5 years, admitted to hospital during the winter months of 2012\u20132015 with a diagnosis of community\u2010acquired LRTI. Children were identified by discharge coding and their notes reviewed. RESULTS: A significantly larger proportion of children who had a NPS sample taken (42/146, 36%) received no empiric antibiotics compared with children who did not have a sample taken (7/91, 7.7%, P \u003C 0.001). Of those who did have a NPS sample taken 17 of 146 (11.6%) had their antibiotics discontinued prior to or at the time of discharge compared with only 3 of 91 (3.3%) of those who did not have a NPS sample (P \u003C 0.025). Children with influenza detected were more likely to receive no antibiotics or have their antibiotics discontinued prior to or at discharge. Only a small proportion of children with other viruses identified had their antibiotics discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that clinicians were generally reluctant to stop antibiotics prior to discharge in young children with LRTI in whom influenza or other viruses were identified. In our view, it makes sense to stop antibiotics when the clinical presentation and NPS testing is consistent with a viral aetiology. Not stopping antibiotics at or before discharge in these children represents a missed opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship.","publish_time":"2017-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walls, Tony; Stark, Erika; Pattemore, Philip; Jennings, Lance","journal":"J Paediatr Child Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10a033b42a127b1a706f34ecb59ca17827fc50ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166398.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.13506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre\u2010school children","young children","use of antibiotics","empiric antibiotics","NPS sample","larger proportion of children","small proportion of children","discharge coding","time of discharge","LRTI","NPS testing","influenza","viruses","Christchurch Hospital","winter months","nasopharyngeal swab","lower respiratory tract infection","usage of multiplex polymerase chain reaction","samples","clinical presentation","ages","retrospective cohort study","missed opportunity","impact","viral aetiology","antimicrobial stewardship","METHODS","years","clinicians","sense","RESULTS","diagnosis of community","notes","CONCLUSIONS","view","AIM"],"language":"en"},

Moribund Muskellunge exhibited tubular necrosis in the kidneys as well as multifocal coalescing necrotizing hepatitis. The FHMNV was also isolated from apparently healthy juvenile Muskellunge at the Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery in Mattawan, Michigan. The identity of the two syncytia\u2010forming viruses (designated MUS\u2010WR and MUS\u2010WL from Wild Rose Hatchery and Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery, respectively) as strains of FHMNV was determined based on multiple\u2010gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The pathogenicity of the MUS\u2010WL FHMNV strain was determined by experimentally infecting naive juvenile Muskellunge through intraperitoneal injection with two viral concentrations (63 and 6.3 \u00D7 10(3) TCID(50)/fish). Both doses resulted in 100% mortality in experimentally infected fish, which exhibited severely pale gills and petechial hemorrhaging in eyes, fins, and skin. Histopathological alterations in experimentally infected fish were observed mainly in the hematopoietic tissues in the form of focal areas of necrosis. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial spike glycoprotein and helicase gene sequences revealed differences between the MUS\u2010WL FHMNV, MUS\u2010WR FHMNV, and two other FHMNV originally isolated from moribund Fathead Minnows Pimephales promelas including the index FHMNV strain (GU002364). Based on a partial helicase gene sequence, a reverse transcriptase PCR assay was developed that is specific to FHMNV.

With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169\u2013284 944), only 0.07% of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0\u2013249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired.","publish_time":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myrmel, Mette; Oma, Veslem\u00F8y; Khatri, Mamata; Hansen, Hanne H.; Stokstad, Maria; Berg, Mikael; Blomstr\u00F6m, Anne-Lie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba394664ad45d9f543519112dcd3dc4b3a213413.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5675387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112950/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SPIA","SISPA","BRBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome depth","high sequence depth","SISPA","high genome coverage","genome sequencing","deep-sequence","reference genome","high copy number","entire BCoV","sequence-independent approaches","sequence-independent single primer amplification","BRBV","full-length genome of bovine coronavirus","full-length viral genome analysis","fast genome characterisation","high-throughput sequencing","SPIA approach","Ovation method","limited study","present study","Ovation kit","low copy number of viral RNA","single primer isothermal amplification","bovine rhinitis B virus","preferred approach","emergence of novel coronaviruses","MERS","techniques","relation","SARS","need","biology","efficiency","fewer sequences mapping","major importance","animal","results","influence of quasispecies","human health","percentage","methods","data sets","nasal swab","clear difference","order","trend","summary","focus"],"language":"en"},

During the 1(st) week, the main CT pattern was ground-glass opacities (GGO,76.5%). The frequency of GGO (52.9%) decreased in the 2(nd) week. Consolidation and mixed patterns (47.0%) were noted in the 2(nd) week. Thereafter, consolidations generally dissipated into GGO and the frequency of GGO increased in the 3(rd) week (76.5%) and 4(th) week (71.4%). Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral (76.5%), subpleural (47.1%) zones of the lungs, and presented as focal (35.3%) or multifocal (29.4%) in the 1(st) week and became more diffuse in the 2(nd) (47.1%) and 3(rd )week (58.8%), then showed reduced extent in 4(th )week (50%). CONCLUSIONS: The progression course of CT pattern was later than the clinical parameters within the first two weeks since admission; however, there was a synchronized improvement in both clinical and radiologic features in the 4(th) week.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xiaoyu; Cao, Yukun; Jiang, Nanchuan; Chen, Yan; Alwalid, Osamah; Zhang, Xin; Gu, Jin; Dai, Meng; Liu, Jie; Zhu, Wanyue; Zheng, Chuansheng; Shi, Heshui","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d00a0e49339e14493cb55796ee8eb47bebcb4273.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["main CT pattern","mean CT score","section CT scans","progression course of CT pattern","weeks","frequency of GGO","admission","rd","discharged patients","evolution of clinical features","section CT imaging of novel coronavirus pneumonia","COVID","Longitudinal changes of clinical parameters","radiologic features","synchronized improvement","reduced extent","marked improvement of fever","ground-glass opacities","C-reactive protein","lymphocytes count","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","lungs","mixed patterns","zones","subpleural","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","disease","recovery","consolidations"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: We offer a systematic analysis of NASBA design with a view toward expanding its applicability. METHODS: We examine the parameters that effect dimer formations, and we provide a framework for designing NASBA primers that will reduce false-positive results and make NASBA suitable for more POC diagnostic applications. Then we compare three different oligonucleotide sets to examine (1) the inhibitory effect of dimer formations, (2) false positives with poorly designed primers, and (3) the effect of beacon target location during real-time NASBA. The required T7 promoter sequence adversely affects the reaction kinetics, although the common abridged sequence can improve kinetics without sacrificing accuracy. RESULTS: We demonstrate that poorly designed primers undergo real-time exponential amplification in the absence of target RNA, resulting in false positives with a time to half of the peak value (t (1/2)) of 50 min compared to 45 min for true positives. Redesigning the oligonucleotides to avoid inhibitory dimers eliminated false positives and reduced the true positive t (1/2) by 10 min. Finally, we confirm the efficacy of two molecular beacon design schemes and discuss their multiplexing utility in two clinical scenarios. CONCLUSION: This study provides a pathway for using NASBA in developing POC diagnostic assays.

Cow-calf pairs were assigned randomly to treatment with 2 replications (pasture) per year for 3 yr. Treatments were (1) recommended stocking rate of 9.46 animal-unit month/ha with no supplementation (CON) or (2) double the recommended stocking rate (18.9 animal-unit month/ha) and supplemented with a 30:70 modified distillers grains plus solubles:cornstalks (DM) mixture (SUPP).

Besides functioning as a mechanical barrier, the mucosae are endowed with an array of still poorly characterized specific and nonspecific host defense capabilities. These include the production of mucus, secretory immunoglobulin (IgA), lysozyme, lactoferrin, and alpha-antitrypsin, in conjunction with a low-grade exudation of leukocytes.1 In addition, the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and lower vaginal and urinary tracts support a large number of \u201Cnonpathogenic\u201D microorganisms that comprise the so-called \u201Cnormal flora.\u201D This commensal flora plays an important and complex role in protecting the host from microbial invasion. Mechanisms for this protection likely include the following: (1) competition for the same nutrients (interference); (2) competition for the same receptors on host cells (tropism); (3) production of bacteriocins, that is, bacterial products that are toxic to other organisms, usually of the same species; and (4) stimulation of crossprotective immune factors such as the \u201Cnatural antibodies.\u201D1 The \u201Cnormal\u201D flora is inconstant and may be altered by dietary factors, debilitation, hormonal events (such as menstruation, pregnancy, and possibly use of oral contraceptives), personal hygiene, medications, intercurrent infection, and probably many others. Antibiotic therapy and menstruation can have a profound effect on the composition of this group of microorganisms.2 Disturbance of the delicate host-commensal relationship may cause a clinically significant infection due to these \u201Cnonpathogens.\u201D This may occur in response to the aforementioned factors (eg, pregnancy predisposing to vaginal candidiasis) or because of disruption of the anatomic barrier (eg, local mucosal infection at a site of trauma, or injury from cytotoxic drugs) or in association with exogenous infection (eg, rhinoviral infection leading to secondary bacterial otitis media). Invasion by \u201Cnormal flora\u201D may result in serious systemic illness. A clear example of the latter is the development of infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci following a dental procedure.","publish_time":"1987-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wormser, Gary P.; Nunez, Miguel; Horn, David","journal":"Clinics in Dermatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da4f878f7c738dbe7bf8f0a77b95c34bd3a6de9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0738081X87900137; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0738081X87900137","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal flora","rhinoviral infection","exogenous infection","intercurrent infection","significant infection","commensal flora","local mucosal infection","host cells","delicate host-commensal relationship","dietary factors","aforementioned factors","group of microorganisms","menstruation","pregnancy","competition","microbial invasion","following","nonspecific host defense capabilities","mucosal surfaces","bacterial products","vaginal candidiasis","anatomic barrier","stimulation of crossprotective immune factors","mechanical barrier","production of mucus","production of bacteriocins","secondary bacterial otitis media","personal hygiene","viridans streptococci","urinary tracts","principal barriers","large number","hormonal events","site of trauma","conjunction","lysozyme","IgA","secretory immunoglobulin","medications","complex role","Disturbance","cytotoxic drugs","mucous membranes","low-grade exudation of leukocytes","alpha-antitrypsin","development of infective endocarditis","lactoferrin","injury","oral contraceptives","profound effect","addition","composition","debilitation","disruption","association","tropism","receptors","body","dental procedure","skin","array","mucosae","serious systemic illness","interference","natural antibodies","Antibiotic therapy","species","protection","nutrients","functioning","response","nonpathogens","clear example","Mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

It is currently unknown whether Tritrichomonas foetus or Pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents. The objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for T. foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between 2007 and 2010. We also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time PCR panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens. P. hominis, T. foetus, or both were identified by PCR in feces of 17, 1, and 1 dogs respectively. Feces from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus, P. hominis and using broader-spectrum Trichomonadida primers. The total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by PCR as infected with trichomonads. These results suggest that P. hominis infection is more frequently identified than T. foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population.","publish_time":"2012-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tolbert, M.

Although asthma, COPD and LTRI are distinctly different diseases with separate mechanisms of disease progression, they do share a common feature \u2013 airway inflammation with intense recruitment and activation of granulocytes and mast cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells are crucial players in host defense against pathogens and maintenance of lung homeostasis. Upon contact with harmful particles, part of the pulmonary defense mechanism is to recruit these cells into the airways. Despite their protective nature, overactivation or accumulation of granulocytes and mast cells in the lungs results in unwanted chronic airway inflammation and damage. As such, understanding the bright and the dark side of these leukocytes in lung physiology paves the way for the development of therapies targeting this important mechanism of disease.

On April 29th 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 26,277 infected cases; among them, 10,884 have deceased. The epidemic is still ongoing, particularly in Sierra Leone. It is now clear that northern countries will be implicated in the care of EVD patients, both in the field and back at home. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. It is highly probable that intensive care would be able to significantly reduce the mortality linked with EVD. The preparation of a modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to treat an EVD patient in good conditions requires time and specific equipment. The cornerstone of this preparation includes two main goals: treating the patient and protecting healthcare providers. Staff training is time consuming and must be performed far in advance of patient arrival. To be efficient, preparation should be planned at a national level with help from public authorities, as was the case in France during the summer of 2014. Due to the severity of the disease, the high risk of transmission and scarce knowledge on EVD treatment, our propositions are necessarily original and innovative.

Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow\u2019s milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.

The outpatient nature of Allergy-Immunology coupled with the ease of conducting many aspects of a routine visit via telemedicine makes incorporation of telehealth training into fellowship programs highly desirable. The short-term closure of hospital-affiliated clinics, in particular for vulnerable or immunodeficient patients, in the setting of a global pandemic demonstrates the timeliness of this topic.

We also assessed the factors associated with severe disease and tested the ability of a scoring system for identifying influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia. Methods Prospective cohort study carried out at 10 tertiary hospitals of Spain. All adults hospitalised with CAP from December 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011 were analysed. Results A total of 747 adults with CAP required hospitalisation. The aetiology was determined in 315 (42.2%) patients, in whom 154 (21.9%) were due to bacteria, 125 (16.7%) were due to viruses and 36 (4.8%) were mixed (due to viruses and bacteria). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococccus pneumoniae. Among patients with viral pneumonia, the most common organism identified were influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. Independent factors associated with severe disease were impaired consciousness, septic shock, tachypnea, hyponatremia, hypoxemia, influenza B, and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. The scoring system evaluated did not differentiate reliably between patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and those with other aetiologies. Conclusions The frequency of bacterial and viral pneumonia during the first post-pandemic influenza season was similar. The main identified virus was influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, which was associated with severe disease. Although certain presenting clinical features may allow recognition of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia, it is difficult to express them in a reliable scoring system.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viasus, Diego; Marinescu, Carmen; Villoslada, Aroa; Cordero, Elisa; G\u00E1lvez-Acebal, Juan; Fari\u00F1as, Mar\u00EDa C.; Gracia-Ahufinger, Irene; Fern\u00E1ndez-Navarro, Anabel; Niub\u00F3, Jordi; Ortega, Lucia; Mu\u00F1ez-Rubio, Elena; Romero-G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa P.; Carratal\u00E0, Jordi","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19bdc8716fb2006dc855806b4a3b97819288b13b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112525.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016344531300131X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2013.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344531300131X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23747416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["H1N1","recognition of influenza","influenza B","pdm09-related pneumonia","post-pandemic influenza season","viral pneumonia","severe disease","patients","reliable scoring system","prognosis of CAP","aetiology","adults","isolated bacteria","viruses","certain presenting clinical features","Independent factors","main identified virus","septic shock","tachypnea","impaired consciousness","hyponatremia","hypoxemia","common organism","frequency of bacterial","Methods Prospective cohort study","ability","tertiary hospitals of Spain","Conclusions","Streptococccus pneumoniae","Summary Objectives","total","hospitalisation","aetiologies"],"language":"en"},

This model of evolution placed emphasis on mutant generation, to the point of invalidating the concept of wild-type genomes as a defined sequence of nucleotides. In striking similarity with the proposals for such early replicons, present-day RNA viruses consist of complex distributions of nonidentical but closely related genomes termed quasispecies. Objectives: To discuss indeterminations inherent to a quasispecies structure and to the analytical procedures to define it, biological implications of quasispecies, and the need to take into account this type of population structure, in order to design effective strategies to prevent and control diseases caused by highly variable viruses. Results: Quasispecies have many biological implications, extending from viral pathogenesis to the emergence of new pathogens, rapid antigenic variation, and alterations in cell tropism, virulence, host range and viral gene expression. Conclusions: Diseases caused by highly variable RNA viruses prove very difficult to control and vaccine development against such viruses are largely unsuccessful. It is important to understand quasispecies composition and dynamics, as quasispecies are an important step in the natural history of RNA viruses.","publish_time":"1998-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Clinical and Diagnostic Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93a9ce5dc65920bc235049037d9c03b211395c57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135314.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928019798000324; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928019798000324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Manfred Eigen"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quasispecies structure","variable viruses","quasispecies composition","variable RNA viruses","biological implications of quasispecies","present-day RNA viruses","model of evolution","natural history of RNA viruses","new model of molecular evolution","type genomes","rapid evolution of simple replicons","control diseases","type of population structure","viral pathogenesis","related genomes","early replicons","important step","rapid antigenic variation","emergence of new pathogens","viral gene expression","host range","virulence","adaptability","cell tropism","complex distributions of nonidentical","alterations","colleagues","proposals","s Manfred Eigen","order","dynamics","concept of wild","mutant generation","effective strategies","analytical procedures","point","defined sequence of nucleotides","account","emphasis","indeterminations inherent","need","vaccine development","Results","Abstract Background","striking similarity","earth","onset of life"],"language":"en"},

In total, 850 hospitalized patients aged between 3 days and 80 years were screened from September 2010 to April 2014. Among the 351 (47.8%) patients diagnosed with viral infections, viral mixed detection was identified in 49 patients (14%), with human rhinovirus (HRV) being the most common virus associated with viral mixed detection (7.1%), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (4%) and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (3.7%).

The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ucar, Ferhat; Korkmaz, Deniz","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a312b1ea71937f92cf9470a3c171f1643e55786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179515.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720307702?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109761; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720307702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher COVID","existing studies","fight of COVID","chest X-rays","Early studies","existing network designs","proposed network","diagnosis accuracy","light network design","AI-based structure","infected patients","deep learning-based solutions","global health","tremendous impact","augmented dataset","radiological imaging","non-public datasets","poor detection rate","time-consuming operation","daily life of people","site","structures","powerful monitoring","force","outbreak","abnormality","Bayesian optimization additive","genetic material","Fine-tuned hyperparameters","coronavirus","ongoing process","presence","initial tests","crucial action","SqueezeNet","study","motivation","countries"],"language":"en"},

On cerebrospinal fluid analysis, neutrophilic pleocytosis and intracellular protozoal merozoites were observed. The merozoites were oval, 2\u20134 \u03BCm in width and 4\u20136 \u03BCm in length, and had linear arrays of nuclear material concentrated at one pole. Serum was positive for Sarcocystis sp. antibodies and negative for Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. The organism was determined to be either Sarcocystis neurona or Sarcocystis dasypi based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 ribosomal RNA genomic region. Clinical disease resolved following treatment with 3 different protocols for protozoal infection. This case is the first to demonstrate the antemortem diagnosis and survival of a domestic cat with Sarcocystis sp.\u2010associated encephalomyelitis.

Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wyn-Jones, Peter","journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b75d3f310bd21d2790e3a185a34f5202f34489d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114630.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170099; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170099; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17009-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of viruses","infectious virus","infectious cytopathogenic virus","concentration of viruses present","PCR","Publisher Summary Viruses","cell cultures","concentrate","tissue culture infectious dose","appropriate detection procedure","novel approaches","probable number units","Virological investigation of water samples","polymerase chain reaction","multi-stage process","molecular biological procedures","concentrations","real-time","direct analysis","identifiable cytopathic effect","immunoperoxidase","plaque","immunofluorescence staining","techniques","quantitative fashion","count","problem","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Around two fifths of the world\u0027s population, or up to 3.9 billion people, are at a risk of dengue infection. Infection induces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection caused by other serotypes. Thus, there is a need for a vaccine which is capable of providing a life- long protection against all the serotypes of dengue virus. In our study, comparative genomics of Dengue virus (DENV) was conducted to explore potential candidates for novel vaccine targets. From our analysis we successfully found 100% conserved epitopes in Envelope protein (RCPTQGE); NS3 (SAAQRRGR, PGTSGSPI); NS4A (QRTPQDNQL); NS4B (LQAKATREAQKRA) and NS5 proteins (QRGSGQV) in all DENV serotypes. Some serotype specific conserved motifs were also found in NS1, NS5, Capsid, PrM and Envelope proteins. Using comparative genomics and immunoinformatics approach, we could find conserved epitopes which can be explored as peptide vaccine candidates to combat dengue worldwide. Serotype specific epitopes can also be exploited for rapid diagnostics. All ten proteins are explored to find the conserved epitopes in DENV serotypes, thus making it the most extensively studied viral genome so far.","publish_time":"2019-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verma, Mansi; Bhatnagar, Shradha; Kumari, Kavita; Mittal, Nidhi; Sukhralia, Shivani; Gopirajan AT, Shruthi; Dhanaraj, P.

Complete sequencing of many genomes provides the opportunity to study and compare global information properties of those genomes. RESULTS: We have analyzed aspects of the information content of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli (K-12) genomes. Virtually all possible (\u003E 98%) 12 bp oligomers appear in vertebrate genomes while \u003C 2% of 19 bp oligomers are present. Other species showed different ranges of \u003E 98% to \u003C 2% of possible oligomers in D. melanogaster (12\u201317 bp), C. elegans (11\u201317 bp), A. thaliana (11\u201317 bp), S. cerevisiae (10\u201316 bp) and E. coli (9\u201315 bp). Frequencies of unique oligomers in the genomes follow similar patterns. We identified a set of 2.6 M 15-mers that are more than 1 nucleotide different from all 15-mers in the human genome and so could be used as probes to detect microbes in human samples. In a human sample, these probes would detect 100% of the 433 currently fully sequenced prokaryotes and 75% of the 3065 fully sequenced viruses. The human genome is significantly more compact in sequence space than a random genome. We identified the most frequent 5- to 20-mers in the human genome, which may prove useful as PCR primers. We also identified a bacterium, Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, which has an exceptionally low diversity of oligomers given the size of its genome and its GC content. The entropy of coding regions in the human genome is significantly higher than non-coding regions and chromosomes. However chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 12 and 14 have a relatively high proportion of coding DNA without high entropy, and chromosome 20 is the opposite with a low frequency of coding regions but relatively high entropy. CONCLUSION: Measures of the frequency of oligomers are useful for designing PCR assays and for identifying chromosomes and organisms with hidden structure that had not been previously recognized. This information may be used to detect novel microbes in human tissues.","publish_time":"2008-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhandong; Venkatesh, Santosh S; Maley, Carlo C","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/859085c2184a2ca5829809632648e1c80c725d2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2628393.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18973670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Drosophila","Escherichia coli","S. cerevisiae","E. coli"],"organizations":["PCR","GC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human genome","bp oligomers","frequency of oligomers","human tissues","human samples","possible oligomers","Genomes store information","random genome","vertebrate genomes","entropy of coding regions","high entropy","low diversity of oligomers","chromosomes","low frequency of coding regions","non-coding regions","Frequencies of unique oligomers","high proportion of coding DNA","information content of Homo sapiens","global information properties","organisms","probes","Drosophila melanogaster","Caenorhabditis elegans","Arabidopsis thaliana","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","GC content","PCR assays","novel microbes","Escherichia coli","PCR primers","nucleotide different","different ranges","sequenced prokaryotes","sequenced viruses","Mus musculus","building","size","sequence space","aspects","opposite","opportunity","BACKGROUND","hidden structure","similar patterns","Measures","Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans","Complete sequencing","bacterium","species","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","set"],"language":"en"},

The expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli often results in an incomplete folding process that leads to the accumulation of inclusion bodies (IB), aggregates that hold a certain degree of native-like secondary structure. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) impairs intermolecular hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, leading to dissociation of aggregates under non-denaturing conditions and is therefore a useful tool to solubilize proteins for posterior refolding. Cholera toxin (CT) is composed of a non-toxic pentamer of B subunits (CTB), a useful adjuvant in vaccines, and a toxic subunit A (CTA). We studied the process of refolding of CTB using HHP. HHP was shown to be effective for dissociation of CTB monomers from IB. Posterior incubation at atmospheric pressure of concentrated CTB (1mg/ml) is necessary for the association of the monomers. Pentameric CTB was obtained when suspensions of CTB IB were compressed at 2.4kbar for 16h in the presence of Tween 20 and incubated at 1bar for 120h. Soluble and biologically active pentameric CTB was obtained, with a yield of 213mg CTB/liter of culture.

To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yilong; Liu, Rongxian; Lu, Mijia; Yang, Yingzhi; Zhou, Duo; Hao, Xiaoqiang; Zhou, Dongming; Wang, Bin; Li, Jianrong; Huang, Yao-Wei; Zhao, Zhengyan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09d903250451ae770a551ad46d3df9861d947438.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6413878.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218300655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300655; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SAM"],"organizations":["MV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MV-Hu191 mutants","recombinant MV-Hu191","rMV-Hu191 strain","efficacy of MV vaccine","parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain","improved MV vaccine candidate","MV challenge","SAM binding site","live-attenuated measles virus","higher neutralizing antibody","conserved region","mutations","complete protection","efficient reverse genetics system","significant role","potential","Vero cells","considerable adverse effects","public health burden","high titer","large polymerase protein","S-adenosylmethionine","China","safety","hypothesis","results"],"language":"en"},

These viruses infect epithelial cells of the small intestine and cause watery diarrhea, dehydration, and a high mortality in neonatal piglets. Type I interferons (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) are major antiviral cytokines forming host innate immunity, and in turn, these enteric coronaviruses have evolved to modulate the host innate immune signaling during infection. Accumulating evidence however suggests that IFN induction and signaling in the intestinal epithelial cells differ from other epithelial cells, largely due to distinct features of the gut epithelial mucosal surface and commensal microflora, and it appears that type III interferon (IFN-\u03BB) plays a key role to maintain the antiviral state in the gut. This review describes the recent understanding on the immune evasion strategies of porcine enteric coronaviruses and the role of different types of IFNs for intestinal antiviral innate immunity.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingzhan; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1949f80e726d045fe1cccb24a0e911cc0b912b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111337.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27212682/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216302064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216302064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal epithelial cells","intestinal antiviral innate immunity","host innate immunity","gut epithelial mucosal surface","antiviral state","porcine deltacoronavirus","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03BB","IFN induction","immune evasion strategies of porcine enteric coronaviruses","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","major antiviral cytokines","watery diarrhea","key role","reemerging viruses","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","role of different types of IFNs","PEDV","TGEV","small intestine","distinct features","commensal microflora","significant economic concerns","dehydration","recent understanding","PDCoV","turn","high mortality","swine industry","pigs","neonatal piglets","Accumulating evidence","interferons","review","infection"],"language":"en"},

In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify policies and activities to promote access to vaccination of older adults, specifically in LMICs. Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual\u2019s abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teresa Aguado, M.; Barratt, Jane; Beard, John R.; Blomberg, Bonnie B.; Chen, Wilbur H.; Hickling, Julian; Hyde, Terri B.; Jit, Mark; Jones, Rebecca; Poland, Gregory A.; Friede, Martin; Ortiz, Justin R.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/506f01431de0defbd972615f6280389e9381e6e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5865389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17317826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29336923/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17317826","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination of older adults","older adult immunization platforms","adult immunization needs","routine immunization policies","implementers of global health interventions","anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs","developing countries","access","healthcare interventions","industrialized countries","global priority","middle-income countries","global Decade of Healthy Ageing","meeting","LMICs","opportunities of building","discussion of new opportunities","World Health Organization","civil society organizations","funders","stakeholders","industry researchers","individual\u2019s abilities","challenges","chronological age","vaccine performance","life-course approach","broader model","infancy","experts","activities","interdisciplinary collaborations","similar strategies","Participants","context","roadmap","recent shift","Key conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We designed an experiment by using n-alkanethiols with a same carboxyl group and different chain lengths (n = 1, 5, 10 and 15) to immobilize a same receptor molecule on the gold surface of a microcantilever, and detected the nanomechanical response of biochemical reaction. The sensitivity of the microcantilever was found to be greatly influenced by the chain length of linker that is between the receptor molecule and the microcantilever surface. The efficiency of stress transmission increases significantly with decreasing length of carbon chain. At the same time, we develop a label-free microcantilever sensor for highly sensitive detection of Glycyrrhizic acid (GL). The detection limit of the microcantilever sensor for GL is found to be as low as 20 pg/mL for the shortest linker (n = 1), which is 500 times lower than the longest linker (n = 15) and 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icELISA.

Within the past statistical framework, change-point detection technique was widely considered based on large and long data sets. Few studies considered the situation where a limited size of time-series data sets is available in the real estate markets. To fill in this gap, the wavelet analysis with minimax threshold is introduced in this paper. By comparing Daubechies LA(8), wavelet analysis with minimax threshold is a versatile and powerful approach to the analysis of residential data as they are flexible in their function form and provide a robust computational method even with a small sample size. The detected change points reflect some significant political issues and economic collapses. It can be shown from the empirical result that a \u201Cdiffusion relationship\u201D happened from one location to another.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, Eddie C.M.; Liang, Cong; Zhong, Jiawei; Ip, Wai-Cheung","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4ea6081d76e81224014cb7f9f0ce3c2f46cb067.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115552.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287706/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397516304167; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397516304167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Daubechies LA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wavelet analysis","analysis of residential data","abrupt change points","detected change points","series data sets","minimax threshold","long data sets","real estate markets","studies","paper","corresponding political issues","significant political issues","diffusion relationship","economic collapses","limited size of time","small sample size","powerful approach","robust computational method","function form","past statistical framework","detection technique","situation","empirical result","gap","Daubechies LA","location","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed and admitted as pneumonia was done. Patients were assessed according to the CURB-65 scoring system and admitted to the ward or intensive care unit accordingly. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and blood culture were collected prior to antibiotic treatment. 1059 patients were included in the study (23% of total hospital admissions and 20% of ICU admissions). The mean age of participants was 56.8 years, the Male:Female ratio was 3:1, and the lengths of stay in the ward and intensive care units were 5 and 14.5 days, respectively. The main organisms cultured from sputum were Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae, Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and community-acquired MRSA. The mortality rate in the ward was 2.4%, while the rate in the ICU was 21.45%. The organisms which caused pneumonia were found to be different during Hajj. The usual standard guideline for the treatment of pneumonia was ineffective for the causative organisms. Therefore, specific adjustments in the guidelines are needed. All efforts should be made to determine the infectious agent.

In a previous study, the efficacy of parenteral toltrazuril (45 mg/piglet, Group Forceris\u00AE) applied on the 2nd day of life (dol), and of oral toltrazuril (20 mg/kg of body weight, Group Baycox\u00AE) applied on the 4th dol was evaluated in an experimental model with Cystoisospora suis infection on the 3rd dol (late infection, LI). In a follow-up study, efficacy and safety were evaluated against infections with C. suis on the 1st dol (early infection, EI). Parameters included oocyst excretion and faecal consistency, body weight development, bacteriological examinations and animal health. RESULTS: All control piglets (n = 12) shed oocysts and had diarrhoea, while parasite excretion was completely suppressed in both treatment groups (n = 13 each) and diarrhoea was reduced to a single animal (Forceris\u00AE group), resulting in significant differences for these parameters between the treated groups and the controls without significant differences among the treatment groups. No treatment-related adverse events were noted. Body weight gain was reduced in the control group during the acute phase of infection, resulting in significantly lower body weight on the 15th dol. Sows and piglets shed high numbers of Escherichia coli. Clostridium perfringens type A was only detected in low amounts in pooled litter samples. In comparison to the LI study oocyst shedding was more intense in the control animals in EI, while diarrhea was more frequent in LI. In both infection models a high efficacy of toltrazuril in the control of parasitological and clinical outcomes of experimental C. suis infection could be demonstrated. Since in the LI study high numbers of Cl. perfringens type A were detected, it is hypothesized that colonization with these opportunistic pathogens has synergistic effects with C. suis and may explain variable clinical outcomes in untreated animals as well as the sporadic occurrence of diarrhea in toltrazuril-treated piglets.

We aimed to identify all case-control studies investigating the potential role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of ARI in older adults aged \u226565 years. We conducted a systematic literature review (across 7 databases) of case-control studies published from 1996 to 2017 that investigated the viral profile of older adults with and those without ARI. We then computed a pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval and virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) for 8 common viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV). From the 16 studies included, there was strong evidence of possible causal attribution for RSV (OR, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9\u201318.5]; AFE, 88%), Flu (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4\u201315.9]; AFE, 88%), PIV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), HMPV (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3\u201341.0]; AFE, 90%), AdV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), RV (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7\u201313.6]; AFE, 86%) and CoV (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0\u20134.1]; AFE, 65%) in older adults presenting with ARI, compared with those without respiratory symptoms (ie, asymptomatic individuals) or healthy older adults. However, there was no significant difference in the detection of BoV in cases and controls. This review supports RSV, Flu, PIV, HMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV as important causes of ARI in older adults and provides quantitative estimates of the absolute proportion of virus-associated ARI cases to which a viral cause can be attributed. Disease burden estimates should take into account the appropriate AFE estimates (for older adults) that we report.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Ting; Arnott, Andrew; Semogas, Indre; Falsey, Ann R; Openshaw, Peter; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Campbell, Harry; Nair, Harish","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e7881e97024fe722e03b821d76391d8361a8008.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107439.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849176/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy older adults","appropriate AFE estimates","viral profile of older adults","etiology of ARI","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","associated ARI cases","RSV","PIV","AdV","HMPV","CoV","important causes of ARI","respiratory symptoms","absolute proportion of virus","Disease burden estimates","case-control studies","virus-specific attributable fraction","potential role of respiratory viruses","quantitative estimates","Acute respiratory tract infections","substantial disease burden","common viruses","asymptomatic individuals","elderly individuals","detection of BoV","viral cause","systematic literature review","databases","account","human metapneumovirus","strong evidence of possible causal attribution","adenovirus","confidence interval","bocavirus","rhinovirus","significant difference","controls","coronavirus","pooled odds ratio","years"],"language":"en"},

When testing stool samples by cell culture, virus isolates are sometimes obtained which cannot be typed by current methods. In this study we used VIDISCA, a virus identification method which has not yet been widely applied, on such an untyped virus isolate. RESULTS: We found a human parechovirus (HPeV) type 1 (strain designation: BNI-788st). Because genomes of contemporary HPeV1 were not available, we determined its complete genome sequence. We found that the novel strain was likely the result of recombination between structural protein genes of an ancestor of contemporary HPeV1 strains and nonstructural protein genes from an unknown ancestor, most closely related to HPeV3. In contrast to the non-structural protein genes of other HPeV prototype strains, the non-structural protein genes of BNI-788st and HPeV3 prototype strains did not co-segregate in bootscan analysis with that of other prototype strains. CONCLUSION: HPeV3 nonstructural protein genes may form a distinct element in a pool of circulating HPeV non-structural protein genes. More research into the complex HPeV evolution is required to connect virus ecology with disease patterns in humans.","publish_time":"2008-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Souza Luna, Luciano Kleber; Baumgarte, Sigrid; Grywna, Klaus; Panning, Marcus; Drexler, Jan Felix; Drosten, Christian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e2457559eab2f9b131de9084d5dfc66bd875aee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2270820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18269761/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-26","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-structural protein genes of BNI","HPeV3 nonstructural protein genes","HPeV prototype strains","pool of circulating HPeV non-structural protein genes","HPeV3 prototype strains","ancestor of contemporary HPeV1 strains","virus ecology","virus isolates","untyped virus","complex HPeV evolution","virus identification method","genomes of contemporary HPeV1","unknown ancestor","strain designation","novel strain","co-segregate","distinct element","result of recombination","cell culture","bootscan analysis","stool samples","VIDISCA","disease patterns","humans","human parechovirus","CONCLUSION","research","contrast","complete genome sequence","Enteritis","RESULTS","study","spectrum of viruses","current methods","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In most European Union member states specialized isolation facilities are responsible for the management of such cases. Ground ambulances are often affiliated with those facilities because rapid relocation of patients is most desirable. To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the \u2018European Network for HIDs\u2019 conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated and feedback rates ranged from 78% to 100% (n = 37 to n = 48 centres). Only 46.8% (22/47) of all centres have both national and local guidelines regulating HID patient transport. If recommended, specific equipment is found in 90% of centres (9/10), but standard ambulances in only 6/13 centres (46%). Exclusive entrances (32/45; 71%) and pathways (30/44; 68.2%) for patient admission, as well as protocols for disinfection of ambulances (34/47; 72.3%) and equipment (30/43; 69.8%) exist in most centres. In conclusion, the availability and technical specifications of ambulances broadly differ, reflecting different preparedness levels within the European Union. Hence, regulations for technical specifications and operational procedures should be harmonized to promote patient and healthcare worker safety.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schilling, S.; Maltezou, H.

During synthesisin vitroin the presence of microsomes, the 27.7-kDa polypeptide became an integral membrane protein, retained its postulated hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence, and underwent glycosylation on apparently two asparagine linkage sites to attain a final molecular mass of 31 kDa. A 20-kDa N-terminally truncated, nonglycosylated, nonanchored form of the protein was also made via an unknown mechanism. The existence of both transmembrane and soluble forms of the gene 3 product in the cell is suggested by immunofluorescence patterns showing both a punctated perinuclear and diffuse intracytoplasmic distribution.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(5), 277\u2013293. Background There is a requirement to detect and differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1v) and established swine influenza A viruses (SIVs) by real time reverse transcription (RRT) PCR methods. Objectives First, modify an existing matrix (M) gene RRT PCR for sensitive generic detection of H1N1v and other European SIVs. Second, design an H1 RRT PCR to specifically detect H1N1v infections. Methods RRT PCR assays were used to test laboratory isolates of SIV (n = 51; 37 European and 14 North American), H1N1v (n = 5) and avian influenza virus (AIV; n = 43). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated for swabs (n = 133) and tissues (n = 116) collected from field cases and pigs infected experimentally with SIVs and H1N1v. Results The \u201Cperfect match\u201D M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive variant of this test for detection of established European SIVs and H1N1v. H1 RRT PCR specifically detected H1N1v but not European SIVs. Validation with clinical specimens included comparison with virus isolation (VI) as a \u201Cgold standard\u201D, while field infection with H1N1v in swine was independently confirmed by sequencing H1N1v amplified by conventional RT PCR. \u201CPerfect match\u201D M gene RRT PCR had 100% sensitivity and 95\u00B72% specificity for swabs, 93\u00B76% and 98\u00B76% for tissues. H1 RRT PCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99\u00B71%, respectively, for the swabs, and 100% and 100% for the tissues. Conclusions Two RRT PCRs for the purposes of (i) generic detection of SIV and H1N1v infection in European pigs, and for (ii) specific detection of H1N1v (pandemic influenza) infection were validated.","publish_time":"2010-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slomka, Marek J.; Densham, Anstice L.

This article describes those infections of the airway that are most likely to present to the anesthetist, their attendant complications and recommendations for treatment.","publish_time":"2009-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"JENKINS, IAN A.; SAUNDERS, MICHAEL","journal":"Paediatr Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa6a5e61097c9f6fcf6c12d2a0dfaa2bc0ee49ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168042.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19572851/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.02999.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care","Lemierre"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anesthetist","potential complications","attendant complications","serious complications","clinical management","Emergency Department","locations","airway","Infections","Operating Department","clinical features","essential management","common conditions","diagnoses","date knowledge of presentations","epiglottitis","diphtheria","recommendations","diminished incidence","regard","Intensive Care","eventual outcome","treatment","children","Lemierre\u2019s syndrome","surgical team","interventions","performance","Diseases","article","instances","clinicians","time","comeback"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted of a 2003 study of 176 hospital-based healthcare workers, which surveyed lifetime traumatic events, recent life events, psychological distress, coping, social support, and days off work due to stress or illness. RESULTS: Sixty eight percent (95% CI 61.1\u201374.9) of healthcare workers had one or more experience of violence, abuse or neglect, 33% (95% CI 26.1\u201340.0) before the age of 13. Compared to healthcare workers who did not experience childhood adversity, those who did reported more recent life events (median 11 vs. 5 over the previous 6 months, p \u003C .001) and greater psychological distress (median score 17 vs. 13, p \u003C .001). The relationship between life events and psychological distress was not linear. Most healthcare workers without childhood adversity (73%) reported a low number of life events which were not associated with psychological distress. Most healthcare workers with childhood adversity (81%) reported a higher number of life events, for which the correlation between events and distress was moderately strong (Spearman\u0027s rho = .50, p \u003C .001). Childhood adversity was also associated with more missed work days. Each of these outcomes was higher in 22 healthcare workers (13%) who had experienced more than one type of childhood adversity.

It is comprised of ten sentinel sites which send weekly notifications of acute respiratory illness (ARI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to the Office of the National Epidemiologist. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, meetings of the National Pandemic Planning Committee and the Technical Command Committee were convened. The pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented as a result of these meetings form the basis of the results presented in this paper. RESULTS: On June 3, 2009, Barbados reported its first case of 2009 H1N1. From June until October 2009, there were 155 laboratory confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1, with one additional case occurring in January 2010. For the outbreak period (June-October 2009), the surveillance team received reports of 2,483 ARI cases, compared to 412 cases for the same period in 2008. The total hospitalization rate due to SARIs for the year 2009 was 90.1 per 100,000 people, as compared to 7.3 per 100,000 people for 2008. Barbados\u2019 pandemic response was characterized by a strong surveillance system combining active and passive surveillance, good risk communication strategy, a strengthened public and private sector partnership, and effective regional and international collaborations. Community restriction strategies such as school and workplace closures and cancellation of group events were not utilized as public health measures to delay the spread of the virus. Some health care facilities struggled with providing adequate isolation facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The number of confirmed cases was small but the significant surge in ARI and SARI cases indicate that the impact of the virus on the island was moderate. As a result of 2009 H1N1, virological surveillance has improved significantly and local, regional and international partnerships have been strengthened.","publish_time":"2010-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sobers-Grannum, Natasha; Springer, Karen; Ferdinand, Elizabeth; John, Joy St","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9adcc3de8f703fe97f002f97da996f4924d5f5ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3005570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143820/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-s1-s10","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Influenza Surveillance System"],"locations":["Barbados"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","pandemic response","SARI cases","passive surveillance","virological surveillance","surveillance team","National Influenza Surveillance System","public health measures","strong surveillance system","number of confirmed cases","severe acute respiratory illness","strengthened public","National Pandemic Planning Committee","pandemic METHODS","public health professionals","severe acute respiratory syndrome","small island state of Barbados","weekly notifications of acute respiratory illness","meetings","health care facilities","National Epidemiologist","virus","results","people","various measures","international partnerships","international collaborations","additional case","outbreak period","Technical Command Committee","adequate isolation facilities","non-pharmaceutical interventions","SARS","good risk communication strategy","epidemic","workplace closures","private sector partnership","significant surge","school","cancellation of group events","NPIs","study","SARIs","Community restriction strategies","Data","Office","spread","impact","reports","sentinel sites","total hospitalization rate","year","basis","CONCLUSIONS","laboratory","paper","complexity","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Like other pro-environmental activities, waste recycling cannot be successfully accomplished by just one or two people, but only by a concerted effort of the community. The collective-action dilemma creates a common underlying difficulty in formulating workable solutions to many environmental problems. With a view to the non-excludability of the outcome, rationality drives people to free-ride efforts of others in waste recycling. To solve this free-rider problem, some scholars suggest the use of economic incentive. This article attempts to study the impacts of reward schemes on waste recycling behaviour of residents in 122 private housing estates in Hong Kong. The study is differentiable from the others as the latter mainly focus on domestic waste recycling in low-rise low-density housing while this one looks into the same in a high-rise high-density residential setting. According to the results of analyses on a set of aggregate data, reward schemes are found to have a significant positive relationship with the per-household weight of recyclables collected, keeping other things constant. The research findings suggest that economic incentives do work in promoting waste recycling in Hong Kong.

A total of 24 field strains were isolated from diseased chickens between 2012 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 nucleotide sequences showed that 16 of the 24 isolates were clustered into four distinct genotypes: QX (37.5%), TW (16.7%, TWI and TWII), Mass (8.3%), and J2 (4.2%). The QX genotype was still the prevalent genotype in southwestern China. Recombination analysis of the S1 subunit gene showed that eight of the 24 field strains were recombinant variants that originated from field strains and vaccine strains. A new potential recombination hotspot [ATTTT(T/A)] was identified, implying that recombination events may become more and more common. The antigenicity of ten IBVs, including seven field strains and commonly used vaccine strains, were assayed with a viral cross-neutralization assay in chicken embryonated kidney cells (CEK). The results showed that the ten IBVs could be divided into four serotypes (Massachusetts, 793B, Sczy3, and SCYB). Sczy3 and 793B were the predominant serotypes. Six of the seven field isolates (all except for cK/CH/SCYB/140913) cross-reacted well with anti-sera against other field strains. In conclusion, the genetic and antigenic features of IBVs from southwestern China in recent years have changed when compared to the previous reports. The results could provide a reference for vaccine development and the prevention of infectious bronchitis in southwestern China.","publish_time":"2016-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Jing; He, Xiao; Yao, Ke-Chang; Du, Li-Jing; Liu, Ping; Yan, Qi-Gui; Wen, Yi-Ping; Cao, San-Jie; Han, Xin-Feng; Huang, Yong","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e9376cfce6209ea7c6dfc8a3106aa0299089ae0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106097.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816303483; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530216/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816303483","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TW","TWI","J2","QX","SCYB"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["field strains","used vaccine strains","southwestern China","field isolates","antigenic characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus strains","Recombination analysis","antigenic features of IBVs","vaccine development","recent years","QX genotype","recombination events","Sczy3","SCYB","results","prevention of infectious bronchitis","prevalent genotype","new potential recombination hotspot","Phylogenetic analysis","predominant serotypes","S1 nucleotide sequences","S1 subunit gene","viral cross-neutralization assay","chicken embryonated kidney cells","ATTTT","recombinant variants","CEK","reference","anti-sera","study","conclusion","distinct genotypes","Massachusetts","diseased chickens","TWII","total","previous reports","aim","antigenicity","J2"],"language":"en"},

Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to begin to address questions regarding virus-host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here we present a detailed study of PDCoV induced replication organelles. All positive strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. However the structures induced by deltacoronaviruses, in particular the presence of convoluted membranes or double membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double membrane vesicles. Significantly however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum and small associated tethered vesicles, double membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doyle, Nicole; Hawes, Philippa C.; Simpson, Jennifer; Adams, Lorin H.; Maier, Helena J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/719443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alpha"],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV replication","virus replication","strains of PDCoV","detailed study of PDCoV induced replication organelles","virus induced membrane rearrangements","dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication","double membrane spherules","pigs","formation of double membrane vesicles","onset of viral RNA synthesis","protein synthesis","virus-host cell interactions","avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","Gammacoronavirus genera","structures","positive strand RNA viruses","formation of regions","genera of coronavirus","rearrangement of cellular membranes","presence of convoluted membranes","small associated tethered vesicles","zippered endoplasmic reticulum","infected cells","questions","progeny particle release","Beta","history of severe diarrhea","Alpha","development of tissue culture","electron microscopy","deltacoronaviruses","samples","date","Hong Kong","countries","world","Porcine deltacoronavirus","USA"],"language":"en"},

Extremes in partisanship are not new historically, but growing policy failures due to negative partisanship have now severely damaged public trust.

We propose a disruptive presidential leadership approach of bipartisan inclusion to seek to reframe the partisan divides, counter negative partisanship and extremes, re-establish better policymaking interactions, and improve governance and policy outcomes. Dysfunctional policymaking has been attributed to Republicans and Democrats in a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. Iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas often lead to higher rates of cooperation, and similarly, historical policymaking included greater cooperation, but in recent decades the bipartisan norms of governance have substantially eroded.

Airway remodeling is characterized by structural changes which include airway smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis due to thickening of the reticular basement membrane, mucus metaplasia of the epithelium, and angiogenesis. Epidemiologic studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. Environmental factors include respiratory viral infection-triggered asthma exacerbations, and tobacco smoke. There is also evidence that several asthma candidate genes may contribute to decline in lung function, including ADAM33, PLAUR, VEGF, IL13, CHI3L1, TSLP, GSDMB, TGFB1, POSTN, ESR1 and ARG2. In addition, mediators or cytokines, including cysteinyl leukotrienes, matrix metallopeptidase-9, interleukin-33 and eosinophil expression of transforming growth factor-\u03B2, may contribute to airway remodeling in asthma. Although increased airway smooth muscle is associated with reduced lung function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in asthma, there have been few long-term studies to determine how individual pathologic features of airway remodeling contribute to decline in lung function in asthma. Clinical studies with inhibitors of individual gene products, cytokines or mediators are needed in asthmatic patients to identify their individual role in decline in lung function and/or airway remodeling.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hur, Gyu Young; Broide, David H.","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a819c63e6e9a3c1979c34b11e3866d23dbed476.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6658410.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2019.11.5.604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway inflammation","decline","reduced lung function","individual pathologic features of airway remodeling","airway smooth muscle hypertrophy","increased airway smooth muscle","asthma candidate genes","individual role","cytokines","mediators","Clinical studies","long-term studies","environmental factors","Epidemiologic studies","subset of asthmatics","respiratory viral infection-triggered asthma exacerbations","inhibitors of individual gene products","structural changes","TGFB1","GSDMB","TSLP","CHI3L1","IL13","PLAUR","hyperplasia","mucus metaplasia","eosinophil expression of transforming growth factor-\u03B2","POSTN","VEGF","subepithelial fibrosis","cysteinyl leukotrienes","ADAM33","reticular basement membrane","matrix metallopeptidase","asthmatic patients","epithelium","ESR1","interleukin","tobacco smoke","airways","expiratory volume","common disorder","ARG2","evidence","angiogenesis","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. RESULTS: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.","publish_time":"2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apolloni, Andrea; Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc7c67f8bf777ec11fcdfdbd36ed0c3fb55f2c72.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3d3298c2222eff022ea013c3a58153f46bba6d02.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1c3e28d4bd170a986bb5566cb9f9616410f67763.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3644502.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0632v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587010/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-176","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["spatial invasion","mobility features","Model results","mixing population","mobility network","demographic data","mobility behaviors","mixing pattern","conditions of invasion","major epidemic","age classes","age-dependent mixing profiles","mixing habits","demographic profile","H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics","spatial level","Heterogeneous features","model parameters","specific age groups","potential of global invasion","substantial age shift","host population","Confirmed H1N1 cases","risk","availability of data","probability of spatial containment","H1N1 pandemic early outbreak","pathogen","contact pattern","variations","multi-host stochastic metapopulation model","local transmission cases","heterogeneous outbreak situations","larger fraction of children","various countries","specific scenario","transportation network","different settings","different scenarios","associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors","travel statistics of Europe","social activity of adults","emerging influenza pandemic","potential effectiveness of public health interventions","late spring","summer","importations","evaluation","importance","interactions","unaffected regions","traffic flows","increase","BACKGROUND","topology","expression","role","immediate assessment","approach","general modeling framework","Mexico","Higher assortativity","types of partitions","transmissibility","community outbreaks","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

It is well established that porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of the TGEV infection, however the mechanism that TGEV invades the host epithelium remains largely unknown. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a known receptor of TGEV. This study discovered that the extracellular receptor binding domain 1 pertaining to epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) interact with TGEV spike protein. APN and EGFR synergistically promote TGEV invasion. TGEV promotes APN and EGFR clustering early in infection. Furthermore APN and EGFR synergistically stimulate PI3K/AKT as well as MEK/ERK1/2 endocytosis signaling pathways. TGEV entry is via clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis in IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV binds with EGFR, and subsequently promotes EGFR internalization by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. These results show that EGFR is a co-factor of TGEV, and that it plays a synergistic role with APN early in TGEV infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Weiwei; Zhang, Shuai; Shen, Yumeng; Yang, Qian","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d5e5498d3b601fe52ac8b1b9a448b3df7c885ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.05.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218301508; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218301508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","Aminopeptidase N","EGFR","APN","MEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV infection","TGEV entry","TGEV invasion","known receptor of TGEV","APN","co-factor of TGEV","TGEV spike protein","EGFR internalization","EGFR clustering","caveolin mediated endocytosis","clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway","epidermal growth receptor","extracellular receptor binding domain","host epithelium","porcine intestinal epithelium","pertaining","severe diarrhea","high mortality","IPEC-J2 cells","target","mechanism","Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","newborn piglets","ERK1","MEK","AKT","PI3K","synergistic role","study","Aminopeptidase N","pathways","results"],"language":"en"},

In total, 38,253 unigenes were generated. When the HS group was compared with the control group, 885 unigenes were upregulated and 487 unigenes were downregulated. When the HR and control groups were compared, 1114 unigenes were upregulated and 420 were downregulated, and when the HR and HS groups were compared, 1010 unigenes were upregulated and 375 were downregulated.

Prevention or curing YHV disease is still not possible due to the lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of YHV infection. In this report, the endocytosis inhibitors (chlorpromazine (CPZ), amiloride and methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD)) were used to identify the cellular entry pathway of YHV. Pretreating shrimp with CPZ but not amiloride or M\u03B2CD followed by YHV challenge resulted in a significant reduction of YHV levels, suggesting that YHV entered the shrimp cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Next, the major component of the clathrin-coated vesicle, Penaeus monodon clathrin heavy chain (PmCHC) was cloned and characterized. The complete coding sequence of PmCHC is 5055bp encoding a putative protein of 1684 amino acids. Specific silencing of PmCHC mRNA by dsRNA-PmCHC showed an inhibition of YHV replication for 48h post YHV injection as well as exhibiting a delay in shrimp mortality. These results indicated that PmCHC was an essential component for YHV infection of shrimp cells.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Posiri, Pratsaneeyaporn; Kondo, Hidehiro; Hirono, Ikuo; Panyim, Sakol; Ongvarrasopone, Chalermporn","journal":"Aquaculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25cd041ddd48e5ed81dea05a1fc841b1e4468d9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112056.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0044848614005262; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848614005262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YHV disease","YHV challenge","YHV infection of shrimp cells","inhibition of YHV replication","basic mechanisms of YHV infection","h post YHV injection","significant reduction of YHV levels","cellular entry pathway of YHV","dsRNA-PmCHC","Pretreating shrimp","shrimp mortality","amiloride","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","Specific silencing of PmCHC mRNA","complete coding sequence of PmCHC","CPZ","M\u03B2CD","clathrin-coated vesicle","essential component","major component","endocytosis inhibitors","Penaeus monodon clathrin heavy chain","Abstract Viral disease","great impact","Yellow head virus","economic loss","bp","chlorpromazine","putative protein","lack of understanding","methyl-\u03B2","cyclodextrin","aquaculture industry","amino acids","report","delay","results","Prevention"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these small molecules accelerate the deaths of non-cancerous cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or other viruses. In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA). ABT-263 thereby activated the caspase-9-mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway, which, together with the IAV-initiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway, triggered the deaths of IAV-infected cells. Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals. Thus, the results suggest that the chemical inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could potentially be hazardous for cancer patients with viral infections.","publish_time":"2013-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakkola, L; Denisova, O V; Tynell, J; Viili\u00E4inen, J; Ysenbaert, T; Matos, R C; Nagaraj, A; \u00D6hman, T; Kuivanen, S; Paavilainen, H; Feng, L; Yadav, B; Julkunen, I; Vapalahti, O; Hukkanen, V; Stenman, J; Aittokallio, T; Verschuren, E W; Ojala, P M; Nyman, T; Saelens, X; Dzeyk, K; Kainov, D E","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43eb920135bc1acb5cb4f1d91b5d06079c53765b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3730437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887633/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bcl-w","chemical inhibition of Bcl","altered Bcl-xL interactions","infected cells","deaths of IAV","IAV-initiated caspase","structural analogues ABT","treated IAV-infected mice","mediated apoptosis pathway","cancer cell death","premature killing of IAV","deaths of non-cancerous cells","mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway","antagonist of cell death","cellular apoptosis","survival rates of infected animals","results","sense virus constituents","B-cell lymphoma","cancer patients","cytokine production","ankyrin repeats protein","associated X protein","non-cytotoxic concentrations","production of key pro-inflammatory","coiled-coil domains","uveal autoantigen","small molecules","Bax","PRRs","proteins","pattern recognition receptors","influenza","BCL2L2","antiviral cytokines","BCL2L1 long isoform","viral infections","UACA","inability","immune system","imbalance","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness.

Here, we analyze the patterns of inflammatory cytokines, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in order to determine their diagnostic value. Methods This was a prospective study of 658 patients admitted with CAP. PCT and CRP were analyzed by immunoluminometric and immunoturbidimetric assays. Cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 [TNF-\u03B1], IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Results The lowest medians of CRP, PCT, TNF-\u03B1, and IL-6 were found in CAP of unknown cause, and the highest were found in patients with positive blood cultures. Different cytokine profiles and biomarkers were found depending on cause: atypical bacteria (lower PCT and IL-6), viruses (lower PCT and higher IL-10), Enterobacteriaceae (higher IL-8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (high PCT), and Legionella pneumophila (higher CRP and TNF-\u03B1). PCT \u2265 0.36 mg/dL to predict positive blood cultures showed sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 42%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%, whereas a cutoff of \u2264 0.5 mg/dL to predict viruses or atypicals vs bacteria showed sensitivity of 89%/81%, specificity of 68%/68%, positive predictive value of 12%/22%, and NPV of 99%/97%.

Moreover, the transport conditions of samples are inadequate, therefore leading to unreliable results. Objectives The development of a rapid, inexpensive, and simple test would allow mobile detection of viruses. Study design A suitcase laboratory \u201CDiagnostics-in-a-Suitcase\u201D (56cm\u00D745.5cm\u00D726.5cm) containing all reagents and devices necessary for performing a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. Results The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42\u00B0C). The results were obtained within 2\u20137min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery. Conclusions The developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well. Moreover, it can be easily implemented to perform diagnoses at airports, quarantine stations, or farms for rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Weidmann, Manfred; Hufert, Frank T.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f795a4873e2ac272c20deb2d9d5ce8ab822f9fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106543.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209370/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.05.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N9 RT-RPA assays","mobile detection of viruses","detection of hemagglutinin","cross-detection","Diagnostics","suitcase laboratory","unreliable results","reagents","rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection","developed assay protocol","equipment necessary","devices necessary","mobile setup","simple test","respiratory viruses","single temperature","ambient temperature","transport conditions of samples","large numbers of incoming samples","farms","reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification","diagnosis","developing countries","novel avian influenza","quarantine stations","genes","limited capacity","Abstract Background","neuraminidase","airports","birds","Conclusions","central laboratories","diagnoses","cold chain independent","humans","development","Study","example","chicken genomes","RNA molecules","solar-powered battery","sensitivities","Objectives","addition"],"language":"en"},

In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding. The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. In the present study we have shown that MHV-3 infection of macrophages induces these cells to undergo apoptosis. Three methods to detect apoptosis were applied: flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA content, fluorescence microscopic visualization of apoptotic cells labeled by the TUNEL assay, and gel electrophoresis to detect DNA laddering. Apoptosis in A/J and BALB/c macrophages was first detected at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) and reached a maximum by 12 h p.i. The degree of MHV-3-induced apoptosis was much greater in A/J-derived macrophages than in BALB/c-derived cells. Apoptosis was inversely correlated with the development of typical MHV cytopathology, namely syncytia formation. Infected macrophages from A/J mice did not form synctia in contrast to the extensive synctia formation observed in BALB/c-derived macrophages. In MHV-3-infected BALB/c macrophage cultures, apoptotic cells were not incorporated into syncytia. Apoptosis was also inversely correlated with the expression of MHV-3-induced fgl2 prothrombinase in macrophages.

HCoV-HKU1 is a group 2a coronavirus that is still not cultivable. The G \u002B C contents of HCoV-HKU1 genomes are 32%, the lowest among all known coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available. Among all coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 shows the most extreme codon usage bias, attributed most importantly to severe cytosine deamination. All HCoV-HKU1 genomes contain unique tandem copies of a 30-base acidic tandem repeat of unknown function at the N-terminus of nsp3 inside the acidic domain upstream of papain-like protease 1. Three genotypes, A, B and C, of HCoV-HKU1 and homologous recombination among their genomes, are observed. The incidence of HCoV-HKU1 infections is the highest in winter. Similar to other human coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 infections have been reported globally, with a median (range) incidence of 0.9 (0 \u2013 4.4) %. HCoV-HKU1 is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections that are mostly self-limiting. The most common method for diagnosing HCoV-HKU1 infection is RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR using RNA extracted from respiratory tract samples such as nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Both the pol and nucleocapsid genes have been used as the targets for amplification. Monoclonal antibodies have been generated for direct antigen detection in NPA. For antibody detection, Escherichia coli BL21 and baculovirus-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid of HCoV-HKU1 have been used for IgG and IgM detection in sera of patients and normal individuals, using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunoassay.","publish_time":"2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick C.

In a previous study we showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) can be used as adjuvant in inactivated vaccines. The aim of this study was to test DE as adjuvant in an Ark-DPI live infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccine after ocular or spray application. Titrating the virus alone or after addition of DE showed that DE had no detrimental effect on the vaccine virus. However, adding DE to the vaccine did not induce higher IgG titers in the serum and IgA titers in tears. It also did not affect the frequency of CD4\u002B T cells, CD8\u002B T cells and monocytes/macrophages in the blood and the spleen determined by flow cytometry. In addition, protection generated against IBV homologous challenges, measured by viral load in tears, respiratory signs and histopathology in tracheas, did not vary when DE was present in the vaccine formulation. Finally, we confirmed through our observations that Ark vaccines administered by hatchery spray cabinet elicit weaker immune responses and protection against an IBV homologous challenge compared to the same vaccine delivered via ocular route.","publish_time":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazmi, Ali; Hauck, R\u00FCdiger; Corbeil, Lynette B.; Gallardo, Rodrigo A.","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0185df64da339e8d1b822db72fee79a25edeb759.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107116.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119314592; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119314592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DE","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine virus","Abstract Live virus vaccines","Ark vaccines","vaccine formulation","live infectious bronchitis virus","inactivated vaccines","T cells","protection","IBV homologous challenges","spray application","tears","addition","adaptive responses","IgA titers","Massive application","ocular route","previous study","hatchery spray cabinet","weaker immune responses","higher IgG titers","viral load","respiratory signs","humoral immunity","serum","CD8","adverse effects","generation","macrophages","monocytes","spleen","main goal","blood","histopathology","adjuvants","frequency of CD4","poultry production","tracheas","diatomaceous earth","observations","detrimental effect","flow cytometry","strategy","broilers","aim"],"language":"en"},

Outbreaks have occurred in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh and have been associated with 40 to 75% case fatality rates. There are currently no vaccines or postexposure treatments licensed for combating human NiV infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of ferrets received a single vaccination with different recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing: Group 1, control with no glycoprotein; Group 2, the NiV fusion protein (F); Group 3, the NiV attachment protein (G); and Group 4, a combination of the NiV F and G proteins. Animals were challenged intranasally with NiV 28 days after vaccination. Control ferrets in Group 1 showed characteristic clinical signs of NiV disease including respiratory distress, neurological disorders, viral load in blood and tissues, and gross lesions and antigen in target tissues; all animals in this group succumbed to infection by day 8. Importantly, all specifically vaccinated ferrets in Groups 2-4 showed no evidence of clinical illness and survived challenged. All animals in these groups developed anti-NiV F and/or G IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. While NiV RNA was detected in blood at day 6 post challenge in animals from Groups 2-4, the levels were orders of magnitude lower than animals from control Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: These data show protective efficacy against NiV in a relevant model of human infection. Further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective single injection vaccines for NiV infection.","publish_time":"2013-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mire, Chad E; Versteeg, Krista M; Cross, Robert W; Agans, Krystle N; Fenton, Karla A; Whitt, Michael A; Geisbert, Thomas W","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5977507d38a03786e12e8e48cda0b431871af042.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330654/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-353","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group","NiV F","G IgG"],"locations":["India","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["NiV RNA","human NiV infection","anti-NiV F","control Group","Animals","NiV fusion protein","NiV attachment protein","groups of ferrets","characteristic clinical signs of NiV disease","Control ferrets","blood","single vaccination","G IgG","G proteins","relevant model of human infection","vaccinated ferrets","target tissues","effective single injection vaccines","Nipah virus","evidence of clinical illness","different recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors","respiratory distress","neurological disorders","viral load","potential","gross lesions","antigen","protective efficacy","orders of magnitude lower","family Paramyxoviridae","post challenge","pathogenic zoonotic agent","postexposure treatments","Singapore","neutralizing antibody titers","levels","data","combination","glycoprotein","Malaysia","India","nature","CONCLUSIONS","technology","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","case fatality rates","Outbreaks","Bangladesh","development","METHODS","days","bats"],"language":"en"},

Brain microvessels and intestine brush-border cells were shown to present a high concentration of aminopeptidase N. Moreover, a labeling of various brain structures was observed. A very high level of binding occurred in the meninges, choroid plexus, pineal gland, paraventricular nucleus and pituitary gland. Moderate to high labeling was also observed in the cortex, caudate\u2013putamen, subthalamic nucleus, central periaqueductal gray, thalamus, as well as in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord, which are known to contain a high concentration of enkephalins, opioid receptors and neutral endopeptidase. This co-localization confirms the physiological implication of aminopeptidase N in the inactivation of enkephalins accounting for the requirement of dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N to observe highly significant morphine-like effects induced by the protected endogenous opioid peptides. Aminopeptidase N was also visualized in moderate to high levels in other brain structures such as the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, hypothalamus (dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei), raphe nucleus, pontine nucleus, inferior olive, and in high concentration in the granular layer of cerebellum. In summary, aminopeptidase N has been visualized for the first time in numerous brain areas using the selective inhibitor [125I]RB 129. This iodinated probe could allow the ex vivo and in vivo localization of aminopeptidase N in various tissues to be investigated and may also be used to evaluate quantitative changes in aminopeptidase N expression in pathological situations. Aminopeptidase N, which preferably removes NH2-terminal neutral amino acids from peptides, has probably a host of substrates. Nevertheless, a certain in vivo selectivity could be achieved by the presence of the enzyme in structures where the peptide effector and its receptors are also co-localized.","publish_time":"2001-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noble, F; Banisadr, G; Jardinaud, F; Popovici, T; Lai-Kuen, R; Chen, H; Bischoff, L; Parsadaniantz, S.Melik; Fournie-Zaluski, M.-C; Roques, B.

In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I\u00B7C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology. IMPORTANCE Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of TMPRSS2 using animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. The results suggest that lack of TMPRSS2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusion Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaorsky, Nicholas G.; Yu, James B.; McBride, Sean M.; Dess, Robert T.; Jackson, William C.; Mahal, Brandon A.; Chen, Ronald; Choudhury, Ananya; Henry, Ann; Syndikus, Isabel; Mitin, Timur; Tree, Alison; Kishan, Amar U.; Spratt, Daniel E.","journal":"Adv Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f543f0b9f240c1a5be36650c73b476e14ebae5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118610.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300610?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292839/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RADS","National Comprehensive Cancer Network"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["prostate cancer patients","prostate cancer stages","low volume M1 disease","low-volume M1 disease","treatment of cancer patients","clinical node positive disease","Remote visits","stage of disease","disease sites","identified stages of prostate cancer","oligometastatic","favorable intermediate-risk disease","global pandemic","post-prostatectomy","prostate radiotherapy management decisions","RADS framework","benefit of routine visits","National Comprehensive Cancer Network","risk group","Unfavorable intermediate-risk","Deferment","adjuvant radiation","Avoidance","Results Recommendations","months","recurrence post-surgery","Methods Radiation Oncologists","United States","United Kingdom","telemedicine consultations","staff available","Conclusion Resources","common cancers Radiation Oncology departments","NCCN","efficient resource utilization","moderate hypofractionation","neoadjuvant hormone therapy","setting","systematic review","COVID","Abstract Purpose","risks","appropriate approaches","Salvage","Ultrahypofractionation","society","Delays"],"language":"en"},

CASD1 has been described as a sialate-O-acetyltransferase and has been shown to be essential for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in some cell lines in vitro. In this study, we used knockout mice to confirm that CASD1 is indeed responsible for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in vivo. We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4\u002B T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, red blood cells from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on red blood cells was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development TER-119\u002B Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase, while TER-119\u002B Ery-C stage cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. These results suggest that throughout murine erythrocyte development, cells of the erythroid lineage express a glycoconjugate bearing a modified 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid, that is recognized specifically by the bovine coronavirus lectin and not by the influenza C hemagglutinin, and this modified sialic acid moiety is a component of the TER-119 epitope. As erythrocytes mature, the surface of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquires a distinct CASD1-dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus that are specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid.","publish_time":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahajan, Vinay S.; Alsufyani, Faisal; Mattoo, Hamid; Rosenberg, Ian; Pillai, Shiv","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06f77d02ae786ab74203b840e3a64dd2c1ab5c66.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4b57ff228e46255a0ba7114af86ff26af4152d9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/469254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylation","sialic acids","O-acetyl sialic acid moiety","O-acetyl form of sialic acid","C cells","sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity","modified sialic acid moiety","sialic acid glyco-epitope","sialate-O","Ery-C stage cells","T cells","Ery-B cells","inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase","influenza C virus","red blood cells","Casd1-deficient mice","surface of Ery","inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase","erythrocyte development TER","mature erythrocytes","bovine coronavirus lectin","distinct CASD1-dependent","murine erythroid lineage","knockout mice","murine erythrocyte development","virolectins","surface of myeloid","important roles","common modification","CD4","component","corresponding enzyme","multiple hematopoietic lineages","host-pathogen interactions","reactivity","cell lines","results","glycoconjugate","rat monoclonal antibody","complete loss","obvious defects","hematopoiesis","study","acetyltransferase"],"language":"en"},

Longer\u2010term effects have not been investigated prospectively. METHODS: After PCR confirmation of rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate, 79 children with the first acute wheezing episode were randomized to receive orally prednisolone or placebo for 3 days. The initiation of asthma control medication before the age of 5 years was confirmed from medical record and/or from parental interview. The outcome was the time to initiation of regular asthma control medication. Interaction analysis examined rhinovirus genome load. RESULTS: Fifty\u2010nine (75%) children completed the follow\u2010up. Asthma control medication was initiated in 40 (68%) children at the median age of 20 months. Overall, prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo (P=.99). Rhinovirus load modified the effect of prednisolone regarding the time to initiation of asthma control medication (P\u2010value for interaction=.04). In children with high rhinovirus load (\u003E7000 copies/mL; n=23), the risk for initiation of medication was lower in the prednisolone group compared to the placebo group (P=.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo.

However, it is often hindered by low primary rescue success rates or yields, especially with field-derived viral strains. APPROACH: We investigated the possibility of enhancing influenza virus rescue by eliciting cell fusion to increase the chances of having all necessary plasmids expressed within the same polykaryon. To this end we used the Maedi-Visna Virus envelope protein which has potent fusion activity in cells from a wide range of different species. RESULTS: Co-transfecting cells with the eight plasmids necessary to rescue influenza virus plus a plasmid expressing the Maedi-Visna Virus envelope protein resulted in increased rescue efficiency. In addition, partial complements of the 8-plasmid rescue system could be transfected into two separate populations of cells, which upon fusion led to live virus rescue. CONCLUSION: The simple modification described here has the potential to improve the efficiency of the virus rescue process and expand the potential applications for reverse genetic studies.","publish_time":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourret, Vincent; Lyall, Jon; Ducatez, Mariette F; Gu\u00E9rin, Jean-Luc; Tiley, Laurence","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/437c2f5c3e920111eb679f26bde02cbb8a49ff49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3558383.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-12-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23009349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus rescue","virus rescue process","live virus rescue","increased rescue efficiency","plasmid rescue system","Maedi-Visna Virus envelope protein","transfected cells","low primary rescue success rates","Co-transfecting cells","separate populations of cells","necessary plasmids","plasmids necessary","potent fusion activity","eliciting cell fusion","reverse genetic studies","fundamental reverse genetics studies","potential applications","defined viral clones","field-derived viral strains","yields","purpose of rational vaccine design","useful technique","chances","wide range of different species","possibility","BACKGROUND","partial complements","simple modification","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","addition","polykaryon","end","APPROACH"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as an enzyme that negatively regulates the RAS by converting Ang II, the main bioactive molecule of the RAS, to Ang 1\u20137. Thus, ACE2 counteracts the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which generates Ang II from Ang I. ACE and ACE2 have been implicated in several pathologies such as cardiovascular and renal disease or acute lung injury. In addition, ACE2 has functions independent of the RAS: ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus and ACE2 is essential for expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota, which can explain diarrhea and intestinal inflammation observed in Hartnup disorder, Pellagra, or under conditions of severe malnutrition. Here we review and discuss the diverse functions of ACE2 and its relevance to human pathologies.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlot, Thomas; Penninger, Josef M.","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25e7bb9df90873615d2b939d99769d43d2443908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110844.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S128645791300155X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2013.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23962453/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S128645791300155X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II","Ang I.

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease.

In case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, infected cells contain accumulations of vesicles forming a membranous web (MW) that is thought to be the site of viral RNA replication. However, little is known about the biogenesis and three-dimensional structure of the MW. In this study we used a combination of immunofluorescence- and electron microscopy (EM)-based methods to analyze the membranous structures induced by HCV in infected cells. We found that the MW is derived primarily from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains markers of rough ER as well as markers of early and late endosomes, COP vesicles, mitochondria and lipid droplets (LDs). The main constituents of the MW are single and double membrane vesicles (DMVs). The latter predominate and the kinetic of their appearance correlates with kinetics of viral RNA replication. DMVs are induced primarily by NS5A whereas NS4B induces single membrane vesicles arguing that MW formation requires the concerted action of several HCV replicase proteins. Three-dimensional reconstructions identify DMVs as protrusions from the ER membrane into the cytosol, frequently connected to the ER membrane via a neck-like structure. In addition, late in infection multi-membrane vesicles become evident, presumably as a result of a stress-induced reaction. Thus, the morphology of the membranous rearrangements induced in HCV-infected cells resemble those of the unrelated picorna-, corona- and arteriviruses, but are clearly distinct from those of the closely related flaviviruses. These results reveal unexpected similarities between HCV and distantly related positive-strand RNA viruses presumably reflecting similarities in cellular pathways exploited by these viruses to establish their membranous replication factories.","publish_time":"2012-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romero-Brey, In\u00E9s; Merz, Andreas; Chiramel, Abhilash; Lee, Ji-Young; Chlanda, Petr; Haselman, Uta; Santarella-Mellwig, Rachel; Habermann, Anja; Hoppe, Simone; Kallis, Stephanie; Walther, Paul; Antony, Claude; Krijnse-Locker, Jacomine; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8984416a285ced3a8855c5b4a473d02ab50e73d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3516559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23236278/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER membrane","single membrane vesicles","double membrane vesicles","HCV-infected cells","COP vesicles","accumulations of vesicles","infection multi-membrane vesicles","MW formation","DMVs","positive strand RNA viruses","membranous replication factories","related positive-strand RNA viruses","membranous structures","kinetics of viral RNA replication","membranous rearrangements","membranous web","site of viral RNA replication","HCV replicase proteins","markers of rough ER","three-dimensional structure","stress-induced reaction","reflecting similarities","markers of early","unexpected similarities","late endosomes","related flaviviruses","Three-dimensional reconstructions","mitochondria","concerted action","electron microscopy","based methods","appearance correlates","cellular pathways","genomes","lipid droplets","family Flaviviridae","member","protrusions","NS5A","combination of immunofluorescence","hepatitis C virus","close association","intracellular membranes","unrelated picorna","NS4B","arteriviruses","corona","LDs","addition","results","main constituents","endoplasmic reticulum","biogenesis","neck","cytosol","study","morphology"],"language":"en"},

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling.

A number of recent studies have contributed to the understanding of HLH pathophysiology, leading to alternate treatment options; however, much work remains to raise awareness and improve the high morbidity and mortality of these complex conditions.","publish_time":"2014-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"George, Melissa R","journal":"J Blood Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af82e1f7e181393a18fb017ee98abdb17fb78d42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4062561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24966707/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s46255","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["understanding of HLH pathophysiology","high morbidity","mortality","complex conditions","natural killer cells","cytotoxic T-cells","bone marrow transplant","biological response modification","Current treatment regimens","alternate treatment options","uncontrolled hyperinflammatory response","hematopoietic stem-cell transplant","wide array of related life-threatening conditions","ineffective immunity","immune modulation","genetic defects","immunosuppression","chemotherapy","reasonable attempt","perforin","Early recognition","curative therapy","Familial forms","work","awareness","number of recent studies","intracellular vesicles","Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","infection"],"language":"en"},

These characteristics render feline viruses particularly dangerous in catteries, shelters and rescue homes, were cats from different backgrounds live in close proximity. The possibility to induce short-term resistance of newcomer cats to a broad variety of viruses could help prevent the dissemination of viruses both within and outside such facilities. Oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs stimulate innate immune responses in mammals. We have previously shown that ODN 2216, a class A CpG ODN, promotes the expression by feline immune cells of potent antiviral molecules that increase resistance of feline fibroblastic and epithelial cell lines to five common feline viruses. With the aim to test the safety and extent of the biological effects of ODN 2216 in the domestic cat, we performed an initial in vivo experiment in which two cats were injected the molecule once subcutaneously and two additional cats received control treatments. No side effects to administration of ODN 2216 were observed. Moreover, this molecule induced the expression of the myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene, a marker for the instigation of innate antiviral processes, in blood as well as in oral, conjunctival and rectal mucosa cells, indicating systemic biological activity of the molecule with protective potential at viral entry sites. Mx mRNA levels were already elevated in blood 6h post injection of ODN 2216, reached peak levels within 24h and returned to basal values by 96\u2013192h after administration of the molecule. Similar induction patterns were observed in all analyzed mucosal cells. Plasma collected from treated cats at regular intervals until 96\u2013192h could moreover induce Mx mRNA expression in fcwf-4 cells and increase resistance of these cells to feline calicivirus inoculation. Finally, Mx mRNA levels measured in blood correlated with the degree of viral inhibition that was induced by plasma from the same cat and the same experimental time point. Our results altogether underline the promising potential of ODN 2216 in promoting antiviral defense mechanisms and inducing temporary resistance to viral infections in vivo in the domestic cat.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robert-Tissot, C\u00E9line; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12a13e50f5ddc7864d33743dedebe6a69f8ea547.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112607.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712002905; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712002905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CpG ODN","administration of ODN","resistance of feline fibroblastic","common feline viruses","biological effects of ODN","treated cats","additional cats","evolution of cats","promising potential of ODN","Mx mRNA expression","Mx mRNA levels","short-term resistance of newcomer cats","h post injection of ODN","temporary resistance","feline immune cells of potent antiviral molecules","myxovirus resistance","blood","mucosal cells","dissemination of viruses","feline calicivirus inoculation","domestic cat","rectal mucosa cells","broad variety of viruses","viral infections","peak levels","Plasma","instigation of innate antiviral processes","antiviral defense mechanisms","innate immune responses","viral entry sites","degree of viral inhibition","protective potential","systemic biological activity","long periods of time","experimental time point","motifs","epithelial cell lines","unmethylated cytosine phosphate guanosine","rescue homes","shelters","catteries","different backgrounds","aptitude","gene","extent","marker","solitary species","fcwf","efficient transmission strategies","regular intervals","vaccine","ability","host","safety","mammals","close proximity","immunological pressures","possibility","control treatments","Oligonucleotides","basal values","characteristics","class","Similar induction patterns","aim","results","facilities"],"language":"en"},

Many new aetiological agents have been described recently. Objectives We looked for respiratory viruses in a population\u2010based sample of healthy adults with influenza\u2010like illness (ILI). We investigated host and spatio\u2010temporal associations with virus isolation and host, spatio\u2010temporal and virus associations with self\u2010reported symptoms. Patients/Methods We recruited 586 participants experiencing 651 illness episodes from a population of healthy adults enrolled in an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. At ILI assessment visits, a respiratory swab was collected and tested for viruses using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participants also completed a questionnaire detailing their clinical course in 336 episodes. Results Of 643 samples analysed, a virus was identified in 44%. Half were picornaviruses, with influenza and coronaviruses the next most common. Individuals with influenza were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 0\u00B752 (0\u00B731, 0\u00B787) P = 0\u00B701). The mean symptom score (95% CI) reported by individuals with influenza was significantly higher than in all other episodes [Influenza: 10\u00B72 (9\u00B74, 10\u00B79); Other: 7\u00B74 (7\u00B72, 7\u00B77); Difference (95% CI): 2\u00B75 (1\u00B75, 3\u00B75); P \u003C 0\u00B7001].

Conclusions Our findings indicate that a greater number of symptoms are displayed by individuals presenting with influenza confirmed ILI compared with other agents that cause ILI. While influenza vaccination reduced the probability of influenza virus detection, symptom score for influenza\u2010positive ILI was not attenuated.","publish_time":"2012-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howard, Peter F.; McCaw, James M.; Richmond, Peter C.; Nissen, Michael; Sloots, Theo; Lambert, Stephen B.; Lai, Michael; Greenberg, Michael; Nolan, Terry; McVernon, Jodie","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a23739aba0ae99bdf7e687731f4c61770cb6569d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5779839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22712831/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00395.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza vaccination","probability of influenza virus detection","virus associations","influenza vaccine effectiveness trial","positive ILI","virus isolation","virus negative","Individuals","respiratory viruses","illness episodes","population of healthy adults","mean symptom score","ILI assessment visits","temporal associations","spatio","host","respiratory swab","participants","self\u2010reported symptoms","based sample of healthy adults","positive cases","Background Viral respiratory infections","greater number of symptoms","new aetiological agents","combination of polymerase chain reaction","PCR","significant morbidity","assays","findings","questionnaire","clinical course","picornaviruses","coronaviruses","reference","analysis","Conclusions","mortality","Patients","Methods","samples","Objectives","Half","Results","Difference"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe the electrophoretic distribution of CK isoenzymes and macroenzymes in healthy dogs and cats and to provide a preliminary assessment of the utility of CK enzymatic electrophoresis in dogs and cats with central neurologic disease. Methods: Electrophoretic separation of serum CK isoenzymes and macroenzymes was performed on freeze\u2010thawed serum samples from 20 healthy dogs and 3 dogs with central neurologic disease and from 14 healthy cats and 6 cats with neurologic feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Electrophoretic separation was also performed on supernatants of homogenized brain, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle from both species, to assess the tissue distribution of isoenyzmes in dogs and cats. Results: CK\u2010MM was the predominant isoenzyme in the serum of healthy dogs and cats, followed by macro\u2010CK2 and CK\u2010BB in dogs and by both macroenzymes in cats. In dogs, CK\u2010MB was essentially absent from both serum and homogenized hearts. CK\u2010BB increased in dogs with neurologic disease.

Conclusions: This study identified the electophoretic distribution of CK isoenzymes and macroenzymes of dogs and cats and provided encouraging data about the possible use of CK\u2010BB as a biomarker for canine neurologic disorders, but not for FIP.","publish_time":"2010-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paltrinieri, Saverio; Cazzaniga, Stefania; Da Cunha, Nazar\u00E8 Pinto; Giordano, Alessia","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdd1ee30b2ec738de2facaa3b36e4c7fe172965e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169260.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20698943/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-165x.2010.00242.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CK","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CK macroenzymes","increased CK","macroenzymes of dogs","healthy cats","serum of healthy dogs","electrophoretic distribution of CK isoenzymes","Electrophoretic separation of serum CK isoenzymes","electophoretic distribution of CK isoenzymes","possible use of CK","utility of CK enzymatic electrophoresis","central neurologic disease","BB activity","macro\u2010CK1","cardiac muscle","macro\u2010CK2","FIP","serum creatine kinase","thawed serum samples","canine neurologic disorders","indicators of skeletal muscle","neurologic feline infectious peritonitis","tissue distribution of isoenyzmes","brain lesions","supernatants of homogenized brain","study","brain homogenates","MB","Objectives","homogenized hearts","encouraging data","freeze","biomarker","preliminary assessment","predominant isoenzyme","species","Information","Methods","Background","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

A novel polyomavirus, designated rat polyomavirus 2 (RatPyV2), was identified from a breeding colony of rats having X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Using a human panpolyomavirus immunohistochemistry test (P-PIT), RatPyV2 was initially detected in the parotid salivary gland of a colony member. Rolling circle amplification using DNA from harderian and parotid glands identified a novel 5.1-kb polyomavirus genome closely related to human Washington University (WU) and Karolinska Institute (KI) and vole polyomaviruses but notably divergent from Rattus norvegicus PyV1 (RnorPyV1; also designated RatPyV1). Further screening showed RatPyV2 inclusion body infection in the lung epithelium and variably in other respiratory, reproductive, and glandular tissues of 12/12 (100%) rats. IMPORTANCE Although P-PIT was developed to detect diseases associated with known human polyomaviruses, the identification of a new polyomavirus in rats suggests that it may have utility as a broad-based screen for new, as well as known polyomaviruses. Our findings suggest that RatPyV2 may be a commensal infection of laboratory rats that can lead to disseminated disease in T cell immune-deficient rats. Infection of the X-SCID rats with RatPyV2 and Pneumocystis carinii is a potential model for coinfection pathogenesis and treatment options during transplant preclinical studies.","publish_time":"2016-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rigatti, Lora H.; Toptan, Tuna; Newsome, Joseph T.; Moore, Patrick S.; Chang, Yuan","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd1d0cb4b82d5479e2aa72ec3d3cde6aae4a4eaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5177731.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00334-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28028546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":["Washington University","Karolinska Institute"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["known polyomaviruses","known human polyomaviruses","X-SCID rats","novel polyomavirus","new polyomavirus","breeding colony of rats","commensal infection of laboratory rats","RatPyV2 inclusion body infection","polyomavirus genome","vole polyomaviruses","designated rat polyomavirus","T cell immune-deficient rats","P-PIT","human Washington University","parotid glands","human panpolyomavirus immunohistochemistry test","colony member","parotid salivary gland","broad spectrum of diseases","immune-suppressed hosts","treatment options","coinfection pathogenesis","potential model","Pneumocystis carinii","Karolinska Institute","WU","harderian","identification","lung epithelium","Rattus norvegicus PyV1","RnorPyV1","transplant preclinical studies","DNA","cancers","KI","invertebrates","utility","screening","severe combined immunodeficiency","circle amplification","wide range of vertebrates","glandular tissues","broad-based screen","RatPyV1","IMPORTANCE","PyVs","findings"],"language":"en"},

The suquence of these MV genes revealed that, most likely, almost 2% of the nucleotides were mutated during persistence, and 35% of these differences resulted in amino acid changes. One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes.","publish_time":"1988-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cattaneo, Roberto; Schmid, Anita; Eschle, Daniel; Baczko, Knut; ter Meulen, Volker; Billeter, Martin A.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f6409c09c836569e3596acc90b0a0f5f41ef685.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867488900487; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867488900487","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MV genes","MIBE case","cluster of mutations","matrix gene","fusion genes","combinations of mutations","favored propagation of MV infections","brain autopsies","brain cells","persistent infections","alterations of viral gene expression","mutated genomes","measles inclusion body encephalitis","full-length transcripts of measles virus","subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients","cases","selective advantage","reading frames","deletion","differences","amino acid changes","biased copying event","nucleotide substitutions","U residues","translation of synthetic mRNAs","suquence","nucleotides","persistence"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate the burden of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer levels. METHOD: In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer \u003E 1000 ng/mL were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS). The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The study comprised 156 patients (65.4% male). All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis. Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5\u201317). CCUS was positive for DVT in 23 patients (14.7%), of whom only one was proximal DVT. Seven patients (4.5%) had bilateral distal DVT.

Furthermore, to prevent the health care system from collapse, resources must be saved elsewhere. Elective operations must be reduced. In order to develop criteria for which operations can be performed, the pandemic is divided into different phases. These are based on the development of the pandemic curve. Various aspects should be taken into account when deciding whether an operation is feasible (stage of pandemic, dysfunction in case of omission, conflict with resources for COVID-19 treatment, alternative: outpatient surgery). Thus, the recommendations for carrying out operations should always be adapted to the current, regional and epidemiological situation of the hospital.

Abstract The perception, acceptability and management of risks are social construction. Consequently, in managing public health crises, the gap between facts, beliefs and feelings tests the responsiveness of official institutions to health alarms that can be objective, potential, or imaginary. On balance, a strong point of the Spanish experience of health crises is the presence of clinicians and public health officers working in an organization capable of responding adequately, although the quasi-federal Spanish political structure has both advantages and disadvantages. Weaknesses include the low profile given to public health and a management structure that relies too heavily on partitocracy. The management of these crises could be improved by transferring greater scope to health professionals in decisions about crisis identification and management (with transparency) and limiting bureaucratic inertia. For some, health crises involve visibility or business opportunities (not always legitimate). Therefore, the perception of crisis will increasingly rest less in the hands of experts and more in those of groups interested in spreading these crises or in providing solutions. While progress is needed to develop participation in strategies to respond to emerging crises, even more essential is the involvement of all healthcare levels in their preparation and dissemination.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00E9rvas, Juan; Meneu, Ricard","journal":"Gaceta Sanitaria","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8363bf6eb8684110c17fbc495d947d12d17f86fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131968.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213911110002554; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213911110002554","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crisis sanitarias","strong point of the Spanish experience of health crises","the perception of crisis will increasingly rest less in the hands of experts and","in managing public health crises","acceptability and management of risks","the involvement of all healthcare levels in","crisis de salud p\u00FAblica","crisis emergentes","health professionals in decisions about crisis identification and management","Abstract The perception","public health and a management structure that","the presence of clinicians and public health officers working in an organization capable of responding adequately","although the quasi","in those of groups interested in spreading these crises or in providing solutions","beliefs and feelings tests the responsiveness of official institutions","develop participation in","preparation and dissemination","The management of these crises could be improved by transferring greater scope","the gap between facts","emerging crises","Weaknesses include the low","health crises involve visibility or business","and limiting bureaucratic inertia","gesti\u00F3n sanitaria","health alarms that can be objective","or imaginary","On balance","percepci\u00F3n","federal Spanish political structure","instituciones oficiales sanitarias","capacidad de respuesta","estrategias de respuesta","profesionales sanitarios mayores espacios","experiencia espa\u00F1ola","niveles sanitarios","presencia de profesionales cl\u00EDnicos","estructura pol\u00EDtica espa\u00F1ola","heavily on partitocracy","with transparency","given","punto fuerte","escasa relevancia concedida","decisiones","distancia","For some","social construction","expertos","sentimientos","alarmas","creencias","needed","organizaci\u00F3n capaz","hechos","both","Consequently","Therefore","respuestas adecuadas","While progress","not always","colectivos interesados","puntos d\u00E9biles","prueba","riesgos","d\u00EDa","transparencia","identificaci\u00F3n","aparatos partitocr\u00E1ticos","protagonismo","elaboraci\u00F3n","conocimiento","desarrollo participativo","construcciones sociales","ventajas","aceptabilidad","manejo","inercia burocr\u00E1tica","negocio","imaginarias","soluciones","implicaci\u00F3n","oportunidades"],"language":"es"},

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.

Neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike of MERS-CoV have been shown to be a therapeutic option for treatment of lethal disease. METHODS: We describe the germline diversity and neutralizing activity of 13 potent human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. Biological functions were assessed by live MERS-CoV, pseudotype particle and its variants, and structural basis was also determined by crystallographic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 13 mAbs displaying strong neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, two with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV)1-69-derived heavy chain (named MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33) showed the most potent neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV in vitro. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, and the combination of 2 mAbs demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. The structural basis of MERS-GD27 neutralization and recognition revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into the specific antibody repertoires and the molecular determinants of neutralization during natural MERS-CoV infection in humans. This finding supports additional efforts to design and develop novel therapies to combat MERS-CoV infections in humans.","publish_time":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niu, Peihua; Zhang, Senyan; Zhou, Panpan; Huang, Baoying; Deng, Yao; Qin, Kun; Wang, Pengfei; Wang, Wenling; Wang, Xinquan; Zhou, Jianfang; Zhang, Linqi; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab8ecae5d2918216407630df1efa44a9e77ed109.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107445.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846635/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mutagenesis"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-GD27","live MERS-CoV","pseudotyped MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV spike","MERS-GD33","spike of MERS","MERS-CoV infections","natural MERS-CoV infection","structural basis of MERS","GD27 neutralization","potent neutralizing activity","mAbs","Neutralizing antibodies","strong neutralizing activity","humans","molecular determinants of neutralization","severe respiratory infection","derived heavy chain","potent human monoclonal antibodies","S glycoproteins","crystallographic analysis","Mutagenesis analysis","immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","specific antibody repertoires","new insights","distinct regions","synergistic effect","pseudotype particle","IGHV","variants","novel therapies","germline diversity","therapeutic option","treatment of lethal disease","data","BACKGROUND","combination","recognition","CONCLUSIONS","epitope","Biological functions","additional efforts","receptor-binding site","METHODS","mortality rate","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, the theoretical underpinnings of the most widely used, coalescent methods have been questioned, casting doubt on their interpretation. The aim of this study is to develop robust population genetic inference for compartmental models in epidemiology. Using a general approach based on the theory of metapopulations, we derive coalescent models under susceptible\u2013infectious (SI), susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013susceptible (SIS) and susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) dynamics. We show that exponential and logistic growth models are equivalent to SI and SIS models, respectively, when co-infection is negligible. Implementing SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST, we conduct a meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics, and show that we can directly estimate the basic reproductive number (R(0)) and prevalence under SIR dynamics. We find that differences in genetic diversity between epidemics can be explained by differences in underlying epidemiology (age of the epidemic and local population density) and viral subtype. Model comparison reveals SIR dynamics in three globally restricted epidemics, but most are better fit by the simpler SI dynamics. In summary, metapopulation models provide a general and practical framework for integrating epidemiology and population genetics for the purposes of joint inference.","publish_time":"2013-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dearlove, Bethany; Wilson, Daniel J.","journal":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05513568bb7b58bb7df33023160838ac885a6144.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3678333.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIR models","SIS models","population dynamics","SIR dynamics","coalescent models","compartmental models","metapopulation models","simpler SI dynamics","logistic growth models","population genetics","robust population genetic inference","local population density","epidemic history of infectious diseases","underlying epidemiology","restricted epidemics","general approach","genetic diversity","differences","Genetic analysis of pathogen genomes","meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics","powerful approach","coalescent methods","purposes of joint inference","age","practical framework","better fit","BEAST","viral subtype","study","theory of metapopulations","casting doubt","co-infection","basic reproductive number","summary","prevalence","Model comparison","interpretation","theoretical underpinnings","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, preparedness planning concentrates more upon population health and maintaining a functioning health sector than on the wider economic impact. We developed a single country Computable General Equilibrium model to estimate the economic impact of pandemic influenza (PI) and associated policies. While the context for this development was the United Kingdom, there are lessons to be drawn for application of this methodology, as well as indicative results, to other contexts. Disease scenarios were constructed from an epidemiological model which estimated case fatality rates (mild, moderate and severe) as 0.06%, 0.18% and 0.35%. A clinical attack rate of 35% was also used to produce influenza scenarios, together with preparedness policies, including antivirals and school closure, and the possible prophylactic absence of workers. UK cost estimates (in Sterling) are presented, together with relative percentage impacts applicable to similar large economies. Percentage/cost estimates suggest PI would reduce GDP by 0.3% (\u00A33.5bn), 0.4% (\u00A35bn) and 0.6% (\u00A37.4bn) respectively for the three disease scenarios. However, the impact of PI itself is smaller than disease mitigation policies: combining school closure with prophylactic absenteeism yields percentage/cost effects of 1.1% (\u00A314.7bn), 1.3% (\u00A316.3bn) and 1.4% (\u00A318.5bn) respectively for the three scenarios. Sensitivity analysis shows little variability with changes in disease parameters but notable changes with variations in school closure and prophylactic absenteeism. The most severe sensitivity scenario results in a 2.9% (\u00A337.4bn), 3.2% (\u00A341.4bn) and 3.7% (\u00A347.5bn) loss to GDP respectively for the three scenarios.","publish_time":"2011-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Richard D.; Keogh-Brown, Marcus R.; Barnett, Tony","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/022a159b5292e57c599853e11c0e1a8b5f8aee06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125702.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953611003029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611003029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21708419/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.05.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bn","Disease scenarios","impact of PI","influenza scenarios","school closure","disease parameters","disease mitigation policies","wider economic impact","economic impact of pandemic influenza","preparedness policies","prophylactic absenteeism yields percentage","global infectious disease pandemic","associated policies","cost effects","UK cost estimates","GDP","severe sensitivity scenario results","notable changes","population health","epidemiological model","relative percentage impacts applicable","possible prophylactic absence of workers","Sensitivity analysis","indicative results","functioning health sector","preparedness planning concentrates","single country Computable General Equilibrium model","variations","case fatality rates","little variability","similar large economies","current financial climate","antivirals","United Kingdom","lessons","development","methodology","Sterling","clinical attack rate","application","contexts","loss","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9].

Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have demonstrated a strong safety profile and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but whether these therapies are effective for treating respiratory virus-induced ARDS is unknown. According to the WHO ICTRP and the NIH clinicaltrials.gov databases, 27 clinical investigations of MSC-based cell therapy approaches have begun in China since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as a growing number of academic and industry trials elsewhere. Several recent published reports have suggested potential efficacy; however, the available data presented is either anecdotal or from incomplete, poorly controlled investigations. Therefore, while there may be a potential role for MSCs and other cell-based therapies in treatment of COVID-19, these need to be investigated in a rationally designed, controlled approach if safety and efficacy are to be demonstrated accurately. We urge that the field proceeds by finding balance between swift experimentation and communication of results, and scientifically coherent generation and analysis of clinical data.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khoury, Maroun; Rocco, Patricia R.M.; Phinney, Donald G; Krampera, Mauro; Martin, Ivan; Viswanathan, Sowmya; Nolta, Jan A.; LeBlanc, Katarina; Galipeau, Jacques; Weiss, Daniel J.","journal":"Cytotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c1aff9ccfa539a96b8ea4d09d1bee1707a58e7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163352.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1465324920306162; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.089; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465324920306162?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","NIH","clinicaltrials.gov"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cell-based therapies","Cell-based approaches","effective therapies","potential efficacy","based cell therapy approaches","possible efficacy","MSCs","global COVID","treatment of COVID","controlled investigations","clinical investigations of MSC","analysis of clinical data","respiratory virus-induced ARDS","infected patients","available data","potential role","controlled approach","strong safety profile","acute respiratory distress syndrome","swift experimentation","coherent generation","balance","communication of results","pandemic","databases","rapid gobal response","disease severity","China","mesenchymal stromal cells","growing number of academic","industry trials","NIH","recent published reports","field proceeds","serious consequences","outbreak","onset","ICTRP","need"],"language":"en"},

The most general concept to begin with is the most important\u2014the microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group. Chromatography is considered to be the most effective means of producing purified preparations of virus proteins, this being achieved by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hierholzer, J.

METHODS: An online survey was performed of orthopaedic surgeons in the German-speaking Arthroscopy Society (Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey consisted of 20 questions concerning four topics: four questions addressed the origin and surgical experience of the participant, 12 questions dealt with potential cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare and 4 questions addressed the influence of the pandemic on the particular surgeon. RESULTS: Of 4234 contacted orthopaedic surgeons, 1399 responded. Regarding arthroscopic procedures between 10 and 30% of the participants stated that these were still being performed\u2014with actual percentages depending on the specific joint and procedure. Only 6.2% of the participants stated that elective total joint arthroplasty was still being performed at their centre. In addition, physical rehabilitation and surgeons\u2019 postoperative follow-ups were severely affected. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic healthcare services in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland are suffering a drastic cutback due to COVID-19. A drastic reduction in arthroscopic procedures like rotator cuff repair and cruciate ligament reconstruction and an almost total shutdown of elective total joint arthroplasty were reported. Long-term consequences cannot be predicted yet. The described disruption in orthopaedic healthcare services has to be viewed as historic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

Naturally, this revolution has extended to virology in general, and to the study of alpha herpesviruses in particular. In this review, we provide a compendium of reported fluorescent protein fusions to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) structural proteins, discuss the underappreciated challenges of fluorescent protein-based approaches in the context of a replicating virus, and describe general strategies and best practices for creating new fluorescent fusions. We compare fluorescent protein methods to alternative approaches, and review two instructive examples of the caveats associated with fluorescent protein fusions, including describing several improved fluorescent capsid fusions in PRV. Finally, we present our future perspectives on the types of powerful experiments these tools now offer.","publish_time":"2015-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogue, Ian B.; Bosse, Jens B.; Engel, Esteban A.; Scherer, Julian; Hu, Jiun-Ruey; del Rio, Tony; Enquist, Lynn W.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3359ea81b72a9d6002755539aa7f91bde5fc87bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4664988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26610544/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7112915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fluorescent protein fusions","fluorescent protein methods","new fluorescent fusions","fluorescent protein-based methodologies","popularization of green fluorescent protein","improved fluorescent capsid fusions","underappreciated challenges of fluorescent protein-based approaches","pseudorabies virus","replicating virus","PRV","review","herpes simplex virus","alternative approaches","general strategies","GFP","structural proteins","best practices","caveats","HSV","instructive examples","context","types of powerful experiments","compendium","future perspectives","cell biology","study of alpha herpesviruses","tools","decades","revolution","virology","biological processes"],"language":"en"},

Actually, their vector competence for this newly described DKV is unknown. We, therefore, estimated the vector competence of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected in Senegal for DKV using oral infection. Whole bodies, legs/wings, and saliva samples were tested for DKV by RT\u2013PCR to estimate infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. The infectivity of virus particles in the saliva was confirmed by infecting C6/36 cells. Virus transmission rates were up to 95.45% in Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 28% in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 9.09% in Aedes aegypti. Viral particles in the saliva were confirmed infectious by C6/36 cell culture. An. gambiae was able to disseminate DKV only at 20 days post-infection.

However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient\u2019s immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment.

Tracheostomy is an effective method to treat severe respiratory dysfunction with prolonged respiratory management and should be performed as a high-risk procedure METHOD: The anesthetic and surgical considerations in this case involved difficult goals of the patient safety and the management of infection among health care workers. Our surgical procedure was developed based on the previous experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). RESULTS: We described the management procedures for tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19, including the anesthesia preparation, surgical procedures, required medical supplies (a N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator, goggles, face shield, cap, double gloves, and a water-resistant disposable gown), and appropriate consultation with an infection prevention team.

Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD\u2013IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.","publish_time":"2011-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vincenot, Christian Ernest; Moriya, Kazuyuki","journal":"Ecol Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d08ab9263350322887d9ae6bd87304a710d0ff3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185514.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954111000331; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1574954111000331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBM","System Dynamics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Individual-Based Modeling","modeling paradigms","SD","IB hybrid modeling","Simulating epidemics","novel hybrid modeling framework","simple compartmental models","account individual heterogeneities","multiscale view of epidemics","explicit simulation","dynamics of real resurgent epidemics","IBM","deterministic model","spatial distribution of populations","Traditional epidemiologic models","spatial factors","System Dynamics","explicit way","valuable alternative","original alternative","possible intrapopulation heterogeneities","detrimental effects","importance","recent solutions","challenging issue","large demographic","reality","technical fusion","large-scale epidemiological processes","interesting choice","well-mixed assumption","metapopulations","spread","aggregated representation of local outbreaks","high precision","geographic scales","approaches","sensitivity","time","implications of results","design","applicability","disaggregated metapopulation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Nucleic acids were extracted from samples collected in winter period of 2016 and subjected to HTS. The results were confirmed by the multiplex PR21 RT-qPCR, which identifies 21 respiratory pathogens. FINDINGS: The main viruses identified by HTS were of families Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses.

Peritoneal ventilation has long been desired for extrapulmonary oxygenation owing to easy access of the peritoneal cavity for catheterization and the relative safety compared to an extracorporeal circuit. Unfortunately, prior attempts involving direct oxygen ventilation or aqueous perfusates of fluorocarbons or hemoglobin carriers have failed, leading many researchers to abandon the method. We attribute these prior failures to limited mass transfer of oxygen to the peritoneum and have designed an oxygen formulation that overcomes this limitation. Using phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs), we demonstrate 100% survival for rats experiencing acute lung trauma to at least 2 h. In contrast, all untreated rats and rats treated with peritoneal oxygenated saline died within 30 min. For rats treated with OMBs, hemoglobin saturation and heart rate were at normal levels over the 2-h timeframe. Peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs was therefore shown to be safe and effective, and the method requires less equipment and technical expertise than initiating and maintaining an extracorporeal circuit.

Traditional or known risk factors for severe disease are well described, but there are limited data on risks for prolonged hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Our aims were to determine factors (clinical and microbiological) associated with (i) prolonged length of stay (LOS); (ii) persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks; (iii) bronchiectasis up to \u223C24 months post\u2010hospitalisation; and (iv) risk of respiratory readmissions within 6 months. METHODS: Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were enrolled at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Standardized forms were used to record clinical data. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at enrolment to identify respiratory viruses and bacteria. RESULTS: The median age of 232 infants was 5 months (interquartile range 3\u20139); 65% male. On multivariate regression, our 12 point severity score (including accessory muscle use) was the only factor associated with prolonged LOS but the effect was modest (\u002B3.0 hr per point, 95%CI: 0.7, 5.1, P = 0.01). Presence of cough at 3 weeks increased the odds of bronchiectasis (OR 3.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 7.0, P = 0.03). Factors associated with respiratory readmissions were: previous respiratory hospitalization (OR 2.3, 95%CI: 1.0, 5.4, P = 0.05) and household smoke (OR 2.6, 95%CI: 1.0, 6.3, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Increased severity score is associated with prolonged LOS in Indigenous children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. As persistent symptoms at 3 weeks post\u2010hospitalization are associated with future diagnosis of bronchiectasis, optimising clinical care beyond hospitalization is needed to improve long\u2010term respiratory outcomes for infants at risk of respiratory disease.

In the present study, changes in the spleen proteome at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection in response to MDV infection were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes had occurred at early stages of the disease. In total, 61 protein spots representing 48 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate (FDR)\u22640.05 and fold change\u22652) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. Overall, the proteins identified in the present study are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the antigen processing and presentation, ubiquitin\u2013proteasome protein degradation (UPP), formation of the cytoskeleton, cellular metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of translation. Notably, early stages of the disease were characterized by changes in the UPP, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, changes indicative of active cell proliferation as well as apoptosis together with significant changes in cytoskeletal components that were observed throughout the experimental period suggested the complexity of the pathogenesis. The present findings provide a basis for further studies aimed at elucidation of the role of these proteins in MDV interactions with its host.","publish_time":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thanthrige-Don, Niroshan; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed F.; Shack, L.

However, humanity still has limited responses to emergent and recurrent infectious diseases. Recent developments in medical technology have led to various vaccines being developed, but these vaccines typically require a considerable amount of time to counter infectious diseases. Therefore, one of the best methods to prevent infectious diseases is to continuously update our knowledge with useful information from infectious disease information systems and taking active steps to safeguard ourselves against infectious diseases. Some existing infectious disease information systems simply present infectious disease information in the form of text or transmit it via e-mail. Other systems provide data in the form of files or maps. Most existing systems display text-centric information regarding infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore, understanding infectious disease outbreak information at a glance is difficult for users. In this paper, we propose the infectious disease outbreak statistics visualization system, called to DOVE, which collects infectious disease outbreak statistics from the Korea Centers for Disease Control \u0026 Prevention and provides statistical charts with district, time, infectious disease, gender, and age data. Users can easily identify infectious disease outbreak statistics at a glance by simply entering the district, time, and name of an infectious disease into our system. Additionally, each statistical chart allows users to recognize the characteristics of an infectious disease and predict outbreaks by investigating the outbreak trends of that disease. We believe that our system provides effective information to help prevent infectious disease outbreaks.

Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"ul Qamar, Muhammad Tahir; Alqahtani, Safar M.; Alamri, Mubarak A.; Chen, Ling-Ling","journal":"J Pharm Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5d41731f93410cad241d58545a8034123cca834.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296570/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177920301271?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095177920301271","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential anti- SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","genome sequence of SARS","middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","COVID","case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","potential anti-viral phytochemicals","enzyme controls coronavirus replication","Recent studies","medicinal plant library","drug development process","traditional Chinese medicinal compounds","proven drug discovery target","lead molecules","optimisation","hits","cysteine protease","chymotrypsin","D homology model","life cycle","global health concerns","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, our aim was to study whether the detection of nasopharyngeal viral pathogens and conventional inflammatory markers in the frail elderly correlate to the presence, signs and symptoms or prognosis of radiographically-verified pneumonia. METHODS: Consecutive episodes of hospital care of patients 65 years and older with respiratory symptoms (N = 382) were prospectively studied as a cohort. Standard clinical questionnaire was filled by the study physician. Laboratory analyses included PCR diagnostics of nasopharyngeal swab samples for 14 respiratory viruses, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Chest radiographs were systematically analysed by a study radiologist. The length of hospital stay, hospital revisit and death at ward were used as clinical endpoints. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 83 years (range 76\u201390). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 112/382 (29%) of the studied episodes. One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 141/382 (37%) episodes and in 34/112 (30%) episodes also diagnosed with pneumonia. Pneumonia was associated with a WBC over 15 \u00D7 10(9)/L (P = .006) and a CRP value over 80 mg/l (P \u003C .05). A virus was detected in 30% of pneumonia episodes and in 40% of non-pneumonia episodes, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.09). The presence of a respiratory virus was associated with fewer revisits to the hospital (P \u003C .05), whereas a CRP value over 100 mg/l was associated with death during hospital stay (P \u003C .05). Respiratory virus detections did not correlate to WBC or CRP values, signs and symptoms or prognosis of radiographically-verified pneumonia episodes. CONCLUSION: Among the elderly with respiratory symptoms, respiratory virus detection was not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia or with a more severe clinical course of the illness. CRP and WBC remain important indicators of pneumonia, and according to our findings, pneumonia should be treated as a bacterial disease regardless of the virus findings. Our data does not support routine virus diagnostics for the elderly patients with pneumonia outside the epidemic seasons.

The UPR signaling network encompasses three core elements, i.e., PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1). Activation of these three branch pathways of the UPR leads to the translation arrest and degradation of misfolded proteins, the expression of ER molecular chaperones, and the expansion of the ER membrane to decrease the load of proteins and increase the protein-folding capacity in the ER. Recently, the essential roles of the UPR have been implicated in a number of mammalian diseases, particularly viral diseases. In virus-infected cells, the cellular translation machinery is hijacked by the infecting virus to produce large amounts of viral proteins, which inevitably perturbs ER homeostasis and causes ER stress. This review summarizes current knowledge about the UPR signaling pathways, highlights two identified UPR pathways in plants, and discuss progress in elucidating the UPR in virus-infected cells and its functional roles in viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lingrui; Wang, Aiming","journal":"Front Plant Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/599be9828fd5c11926e88c8474f37f67f1fe4ebc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3531707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23293645/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2012.00293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ER","UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER stress","ER homeostasis","ER kinase","ER membrane","identified UPR pathways","expression of ER molecular chaperones","load of proteins","branch pathways","viral diseases","degradation of misfolded proteins","virus-infected cells","large amounts of viral proteins","infecting virus","viral infection","unfolded protein response","protein-folding capacity","translation arrest","functional roles","accumulation of unfolded","essential roles","cellular translation machinery","number of mammalian diseases","results","lumen","triggers cytoprotective","PERK","PKR","endoplasmic reticulum","expansion","core elements","current knowledge","plants","progress","apoptosis","transcription factor","ATF6","network","review","inositol","Activation","IRE1"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this exploratory study was to estimate changes in family circumstances, social and economic stability, care requirements and access to health services for patients during their first 12 months after ICU discharge. METHODS: Multi-center questionnaire-based study of survivors of critical illness at 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS: Data for 293 consenting patients who spent greater than 48 hours in one of 22 UK ICUs were obtained at 6 and 12 months post-ICU discharge. There was little evidence of a change in accommodation or relationship status between pre-admission and 12 months following discharge from an ICU. A negative impact on family income was reported by 33% of all patients at 6 months and 28% at 12 months. There was nearly a 50% reduction in the number of patients who reported employment as their sole source of income at 12 months (19% to 11%) compared with pre-admission. One quarter of patients reported themselves in need of care assistance at 6 months and 22% at 12 months. The majority of care was provided by family members (80% and 78%, respectively), for half of whom there was a negative impact on employment. Amongst all patients receiving care, 26% reported requiring greater than 50 hours a week. Following discharge, 79% of patients reported attending their primary care physician and 44% had seen a community nurse. Mobility problems nearly doubled between pre-admission and 6 months (32% to 64%). Furthermore, 73% reported moderate or severe pain at 12 months and 44% remained significantly anxious or depressed. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of critical illness in the UK face a negative impact on employment and commonly have a care requirement after discharge from hospital. This has a corresponding negative impact on family income. The majority of the care required is provided by family members. This effect was apparent by 6 months and had not materially improved by 12 months. This exploratory study has identified the potential for a significant socio-economic burden following critical illness.","publish_time":"2013-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffiths, John; Hatch, Robert A; Bishop, Judith; Morgan, Kayleigh; Jenkinson, Crispin; Cuthbertson, Brian H; Brett, Stephen J","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19d93173c328e9ca42bd4238ccb39aa8da818422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3706775.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/cc12745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23714692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","UK"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["months post-ICU discharge","consenting patients","number of patients","quarter of patients","majority of care","care requirements","family income","family members","corresponding negative impact","Survivors of critical illness","socio-economic impact of critical illnesses","employment","family circumstances","need of care assistance","pre-admission","primary care physician","exploratory study","hours","sole source of income","Multi-center questionnaire-based study of survivors","UK ICUs","significant socio-economic burden","accommodation","economic stability","access","relationship status","potential","changes","health services","METHODS","families","little evidence","RESULTS","Data","severe pain","Mobility problems","CONCLUSIONS","hospital","INTRODUCTION","week","aim","reduction","Europe","effect","community nurse","half"],"language":"en"},

Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, and interleukin (IL)-3 induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on neural cells. IFN-\u03B3, the most potent inducer of MHC antigen, also induces class II MHC antigen expression on microglia and astrocytes, which enable them to function as antigen-presenting cells. Thus, in some pathological conditions, invading T cells can interact with neural cells to induce central nervous system (CNS) damage. Glial cells have also been shown to produce various cytokines and chemokines. Almost all cytokines and chemokines known to occur in the immune system are also produced in the CNS. In this chapter, the glial responses contributing to neuroimmune interactions are reviewed, with a focus on production and functions of cytokines in the CNS.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzumura, Akio","journal":"NeuroImmune Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fbebd0c74d5e15a4fea4d206bbc4816e6b00bd4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567744307100144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567744307100144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neural cells","Glial cells","MHC antigen expression","T cells","CNS","functions of cytokines","various cytokines","potent inducer of MHC antigen","class","IFN-\u03B3","chemokines","immune system","glial responses","central nervous system","TNF","tumor necrosis factor","microglia","histocompatibility complex","focus","damage","astrocytes","neuroimmune interactions","privileged site","evidence","date","interleukin","production","pathological conditions","interferon","chapter","brain","case"],"language":"en"},

Apparently, there is a great need for rapid detection of bioaerosols, for which air sampling often is the first critical step. However, currently available samplers often either require an external power and/or with low sampling flow rate, thus falling short of providing a practical solution when response time is of great concern. Here, we have designed and evaluated a new portable high volume bioaerosol sampler named as HighBioTrap through optimizing its operating parameters. The sampler was operated at a sampling flow rate of 1200 L/min, with an impaction velocity of about 10.2 m/s (S/W = 1.5, T/W = 1), while the weight of the sampler is about 1.9 kg. The performances of the HighBioTrap sampler were tested both in lab controlled and natural environments (outdoor and indoor environments in a university building) along with the reference sampler-the BioStage impactor using aerosolized Polystyrene (PS) uniform microspheres of various sizes, aerosolized bacteria and also ambient air particles. The microbial community structures of collected culturable bacterial aerosol particles both by the HighBioTrap and the BioStage impactor in the natural environments were analyzed using gene sequence method. Experimental results with PS particles showed the HighBioTrap has a cutoff size of ~ 2 \u00B5m. The widely used impactor design equation was found to be not applicable for predicting the performance of the HighBioTrap due to its large Reynolds number. When sampling aerosolized individual Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis bacterial particles, the HighBioTrap had physical collection efficiencies of 10% and 20%, respectively. Despite the higher desiccation effects introduced by higher flow rate, the HighBioTrap was shown to obtain a higher microbial diversity than the BioStage impactor for both in outdoor and indoor environments given the same sampling time (p \u003C 0.01). Our data also showed that most of the desiccation effects might have occurred between 3 and 5 min of the sampling and an impaction velocity of around 10 m/s might be a close-to-optimal impaction velocity for collecting most environmental bacterial aerosols while maximally preserving their culturability. This work contributes to our understanding of microbial sampling stress (impaction velocity and sampling time), while developing a portable high volume sampler. The HighBioTrap sampler could find its great efficiencies in qualitative microbial aerosol detection and analysis, such as investigation of microbial aerosol diversity for a particular environment, or when the low level of pathogens is present and detection time is of great concern.","publish_time":"2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Haoxuan; Yao, Maosheng","journal":"J Aerosol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1d4e7d169a6070e8ea201f4d7cb1f9ca5220edb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b329cfd44ce5114bfd4b9b562fc9f508ee6be795.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185657.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002185021730277X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372770/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.11.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002185021730277X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["S/W","PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HighBioTrap sampler","sampling time","air sampling","low sampling flow rate","reference sampler","understanding of microbial sampling stress","detection time","BioStage impactor","higher microbial diversity","sampling aerosolized individual Pseudomonas","portable high volume sampler","qualitative microbial aerosol detection","PS particles","indoor environments","natural environments","great efficiencies","higher flow rate","great concern","optimal impaction velocity","culturable bacterial aerosol particles","investigation of microbial aerosol diversity","higher desiccation effects","response time","great need","new portable high volume bioaerosol sampler","microbial community structures","ambient air particles","Bacillus subtilis bacterial particles","aerosolized bacteria","aerosolized Polystyrene","rapid detection of bioaerosols","impactor design equation","environmental bacterial aerosols","adverse health effects","Bioaerosols exposure","low level of pathogens","physical collection efficiencies","uniform microspheres of various sizes","analysis","particular environment","university building","practical solution","death","external power","gene sequence method","cutoff size","Experimental results","large Reynolds number","available samplers","critical step","infectious agents","\u00B5m","culturability","work","operating parameters","performances","weight","data"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the potential actions of the UPS during fish virus infection. In this study, we elucidated the possible roles of UPS in the life cycle of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV); a large DNA virus that usually causes serious systemic diseases with high mortality in groupers. Data from transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes illustrated that expression of 65 genes within the UPS pathway, including ubiquitin encoding, ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and proteasome, were up- or down-regulated during SGIV infection. Using different proteasome inhibitors, inhibition of the proteasome decreased SGIV replication in vitro, accompanied by inhibition of virus assembly site formation, and viral gene transcription and protein transportation. Over-expression of ubiquitin partly rescued the inhibitory effect of ubiquitin inhibitor on SGIV replication, suggesting that UPS was required for fish iridovirus infection in vitro. Viral or host proteins regulated by proteasome inhibition during SGIV infection were investigated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Sixty-two differentially expressed proteins, including 15 viral and 47 host proteins, were identified after SGIV infection.

There remains a pressing need for additional pulmonary supportive care measures, especially techniques that do not require systemic anticoagulation. The objective of our experiments was to determine whether systemic oxygenation could be increased in a large animal, with induced hypoxia, by perfusing the abdominal cavity with oxygenated perfluorocarbons. Methods Fifteen pigs with a mean (\u00B1 SD) weight of 45 \u00B1 5 kg were intubated and rendered hypoxic by ventilating them with a blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve subatmospheric concentrations of inspired oxygen ranging from 18 to 10%, resulting in baseline mean Pao2 range of 65.9 \u00B1 9.7 to 26.6 \u00B1 2.8 mm Hg, respectively. Peritoneal perfusion was performed in eight animals with oxygenated perfluorocarbon and in seven control animals with oxygenated saline solution. Results The average increase in Pao2 with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion, compared to oxygenated saline solution perfusion, ranged from 8.1 to 18.2 mm Hg. A common treatment effect was estimated across all fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between oxygenated perfluorocarbon and saline solution, irrespective of the level of Fio2. This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 18.2; p \u003C 0.001). The most clinically relevant results occurred at an Fio2 of 14%, resulting in a baseline mean Pao2 of 39.4 \u00B1 5.0 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and a mean Pao2 of 55.3 \u00B1 7.6 mm Hg with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion. This corresponded to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 73 to 89%. Conclusion These results of our principle experiments demonstrate that the peritoneal cavity can be used for gas exchange and, in our model, yielded clinically relevant increases in systemic arterial oxygen levels. This technique may have the potential for the supportive care of patients dying from hypoxia in the setting of reversible lung injury.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr, Shamus R.; Cantor, Joshua P.; Rao, Atul S.; Lakshman, Thiru V.; Collins, Joshua E.; Friedberg, Joseph S.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86b48dbedbb546bdf43a405dbaf73615ec5689cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126298.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215518540; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215518540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion","oxygenated saline solution perfusion","Hg","oxygenated perfluorocarbons","mean Pao2","oxygen uptake","Peritoneal perfusion","fraction of inspired oxygen","arterial oxygen saturation","systemic arterial oxygen levels","average mean difference","subatmospheric concentrations of inspired oxygen","average increase","Pao2 range","relevant results","supportive care of patients","induced hypoxia","peritoneal cavity","systemic oxygenation","systemic anticoagulation","level of Fio2","baseline","reversible pulmonary failure","additional pulmonary supportive care measures","control animals","abdominal cavity","relevant increases","setting of reversible lung injury","principle experiments","techniques","values","pressing need","maximal ventilatory support","model","potential","gas exchange","large animal","blend of nitrogen","Background","pigs","SD","common treatment effect","confidence interval","Conclusion","Methods","weight","objective"],"language":"en"},

Methods A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. Results The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration. Conclusions In healthy, working adults from the general community presenting at the general practitioner with acute cough and/or suspected LRTI respiratory viruses other than influenza impose an illness burden comparable to influenza. Hence, the public health focus for viral respiratory tract infections should be broadened.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vos, L.

We describe the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings of 40 patients with pneumonia due to S-OIV observed in our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 534 patients with S-OIV, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition, seen between June and November 2009, 121 underwent chest X-ray and 40 (median age 44 years, range 16\u201379) had pneumonia. The initial chest radiographs were evaluated for pattern, distribution and extent of lung abnormalities. Unenhanced chest CT scans were performed in two patients and were reviewed for the same findings. Underlying medical conditions were present in 42% of patients (17/40). RESULTS: Our patients had predominantly mild illness, and pneumonia was observed in 40 individuals (40/121 patients who had chest X-rays, 33%; and 40/534 patients with S-OIV, 7.5%). However, S-OIV can cause severe illness requiring admission to the intensive care unit for advanced mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal life support, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. The major radiological abnormalities observed were interstitial changes (60.0%), with (22.0%) or without patchy ground-glass appearance, mostly bilateral, and located in the lower lung zones (7.5%). Extensive disease was seen in 37.5% (15/40), and ARDS was observed in three individuals (0.30%)with underlying medical conditions. Subtle pleural effusion was noted in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the most frequent pneumonia patterns observed during S-OIV (H1N1) virus were interstitial changes and patchy ground-glass appearance, mostly bilateral, and located in the lower lung zones. CT, performed in severely ill patients, confirmed the ARDS identified with chest X-rays, better depicting the features and extent of lung abnormalities.","publish_time":"2010-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busi Rizzi, E.; Schinin\u00E0, V.; Ferraro, F.; Rovighi, L.; Cristoforo, M.; Chiappetta, D.; Lisena, F.; Lauria, F.; Bibbolino, C.","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2114cdfe6bde05777d1e833e8816387e6957859.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20526820/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-010-0553-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-OIV","ill patients","chest X-rays","ARDS","extent of lung abnormalities","Unenhanced chest CT scans","initial chest radiographs","lower lung zones","virus","interstitial changes","H1N1","patchy ground-glass appearance","frequent pneumonia patterns","findings","individuals","underlying medical conditions","major radiological abnormalities","severe illness","Disease Control","mild illness","Extensive disease","extracorporeal life support","advanced mechanical ventilation","intensive care unit","adult respiratory distress syndrome","admission","US Centers","Prevention case definition","distribution","computed tomography","pandemic swine-origin influenza","features","series","median age","spring","death","METHODS","Subtle pleural effusion","years","MATERIAL","RESULTS","institution","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

After excluding orthopedic and cardiovascular diseases that may mimic a neurological condition, the clinician has to address a long list of different diseases that may affect the spinal cord and produce paresis. Clinical challenges In many cases a definitive cause of spinal weakness in cats is difficult to prove. Even when treatable diseases are identified, the prognosis is very much dependent on the severity of the clinical signs and their chronicity. This review sets out to describe the specific approach, diagnosis and management of cats with spinal cord disease and to outline the most common diseases responsible. Patient group Patients of either gender and all ages and breeds can be affected by spinal cord disease. Evidence base Many diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats, which include fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy, intervertebral disc disease, exogenous spinal cord trauma, spinal cord lymphosarcoma and feline infectious peritonitis, are well described in the literature. Many of these descriptions, however, have been based on case reports or series. While there have been several retrospective studies that describe the characteristics and incidence of these diseases in cats, there are no long term treatment trials or outcome studies to assist with prognostic determinations.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negrin, Arianna; Schatzberg, Scott; Platt, Simon R.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0530ba5da19a801eec93bf5e66ad9ebeff9ad8a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09000801; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09000801; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19389636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spinal cord of cats","spinal cord disease","spinal cord lymphosarcoma","exogenous spinal cord trauma","cardiovascular diseases","treatable diseases","common diseases responsible","definitive cause of spinal weakness","management of cats","clinical approach","long list of different diseases","Clinical challenges","common neurological presentations","clinical signs","neurological condition","Practical relevance Neurological diagnosis","intervertebral disc disease","feline medicine","outcome studies","specific approach","retrospective studies","feline infectious peritonitis","long term treatment trials","veterinary practice","fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy","cases","gender","cAlthough gait disturbance","clinician","characteristics","breeds","incidence","Patient group Patients","ages","prognostic determinations","severity","dependent","prognosis","paralyzed cat","case reports","series","chronicity","Evidence","paresis","review","literature","descriptions"],"language":"en"},

In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9-30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic. Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simsek, Murat; Kantarci, Burak","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Artificial Intelligence"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mobile assessment agents","tested population","confirmed case","effective assessment strategy","unassessed population size","mobile crowdsensing simulator","AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers","past mobile crowdsensing","minimum agents","epidemics","pandemics","entire city","driven mobilization strategy","risk of community spread","worst case analysis","thorough understanding of community spread phenomena","real street map","shortest possible time","self-organizing feature map","campaigns","public health preparedness","mobility patterns of individuals","planning","MCS","related research reports","fragility of healthcare","treatment","SOFM","multiple districts","Artificial Intelligence","Coronavirus Disease","medical practice","immunization","end","simulation results","data","global outbreak","COVID","addition","article","cases","day"],"language":"en"},

It is well-accepted that abnormal osteoclast activity contributes to loss of bone structural integrity and subchondral fracture in ONFH. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the recruitment and hyperactivation of osteoclasts in ONFH remain incompletely understood. We assessed the changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and subsequent osteoclast alterations in steroid-induced osteonecrotic femoral heads from both patients and rat ONFH models. When compared with healthy neighboring bone, the necrotic region of human femoral head was characterized by robust up-regulated expression of osteoclast-related proteins [cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase(TRAP)] but pronounced down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, \u03B3-glutamylcysteine synthetase [\u03B3-GCSc], and superoxide dismutase 1 [SOD1]). In addition, the ratio of TNFSF11 (encoding RANKL)/TNFRSF11B (encoding OPG) was increased within the necrotic bone. Consistently, in rat ONFH models induced by methylprednisolone (MPSL) and imiquimod (IMI), significant bone loss in the femoral head was observed, attributable to increased numbers of TRAP positive osteoclasts. Furthermore, the decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes observed by immunoblotting was accompanied by increased ex-vivo ROS fluorescence signals of dihydroethidium (DHE) in rat ONFH models. Therefore, this study lends support to the rationale that antioxidant agents may be a promising therapeutic avenue to prevent or mitigate the progression of steroid-induced ONFH by inhibiting ROS level and hyperactive osteoclasts.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Kai; Liu, Yuhao; He, Jianbo; Pavlos, Nathan; Wang, Chao; Kenny, Jacob; Yuan, Jinbo; Zhang, Qingwen; Xu, Jiake; He, Wei","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7976cbcebee2d0bdfd1ce0c5e870f9c1d716eea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398957/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.40917","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONFH","OPG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced ONFH","rat ONFH models","necrotic bone","femoral head collapse","steroid-induced osteonecrotic femoral heads","significant bone loss","Steroid-induced osteonecrosis","necrotic region of human femoral head","ROS level","progressive bone disorder","healthy neighboring bone","loss of bone structural integrity","regulated expression of osteoclast","antioxidant agents","progression of steroid","decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes","regulation of antioxidant enzymes","hyperactivation of osteoclasts","hyperactive osteoclasts","numbers of TRAP positive osteoclasts","subsequent osteoclast alterations","abnormal osteoclast activity","ROS fluorescence signals of dihydroethidium","\u03B3-GCSc","\u03B3-glutamylcysteine synthetase","DHE","patients","cathepsin","related proteins","catalase","subchondral fracture","tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase","imiquimod","changes of reactive oxygen species","recruitment","MPSL","hip joint dysfunction","methylprednisolone","RANKL","promising therapeutic avenue","support","rationale","immunoblotting","ratio of TNFSF11","superoxide dismutase","TNFRSF11B","pathophysiologic mechanisms","OPG","addition","SOD1","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: One hundred ICR mice were randomly divided into the virus control, the Tamiflu control and the QZD high-, medium-, and low-dose groups. Mice were infected intranasally with influenza virus (H1N1) at 10 median lethal dose (LD(50)). QZD and Tamiflu were administered intragastrically twice daily from day 0 to day 7 after infection. The virus control group was treated with distilled water alone under the same condition. The number of surviving mice was recorded daily for 14 days after viral infection. The histological damage and viral replication and the expression of inflammatory cytokines were monitored. Additionally, the suppression capacity on the secretion of regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) in epithelial and macrophage cell-lines were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the virus control group, the survival rate of the QZD groups signifificantly improved in a dose-dependent manner (P\u003C0.05), the viral titers in lung tissue was inhibited (P\u003C0.05), and the production of inflammatory cytokines interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-\u03B1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were suppressed (P\u003C0.05). Meanwhile, the secretion of RANTETS and TNF-\u03B1 by epithelial and macrophage cell-lines was inhibited with the treatment of QZD respectively in vitro (p\u003C0.05) CONCLUSIONS: The preventive effects of QZD on influenza virus infection might be due to its unique cytokine inhibition mechanism. QZD may have significant therapeutic potential in combination with antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2014-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Hai-yan; Huang, Hai; Shi, Xun-long; Zhou, Wei; Zhou, Pei; Yan, Qian-lin; Zhu, Hong-guang; Ju, Dian-wen","journal":"Chin J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb5a128897d04ba980fe0f9be9c54d3b5d816642.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-014-2020-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25519444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICR","QZD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["QZD groups","QZD high","treatment of QZD","preventive effects of QZD","virus control group","influenza virus infection","TNF-\u03B1","Tamiflu control","viral infection","expression of inflammatory cytokines","viral replication","inhibition of inflammatory cytokine storm","macrophage cell-lines","viral titers","low-dose groups","ICR mice","production of inflammatory cytokines interferon-\u03B3","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","median lethal dose","dose-dependent manner","number of surviving mice","IFN-\u03B3","preventive effects of Qiangzhi Decoction","secretion of RANTETS","unique cytokine inhibition mechanism","RANTES","\u7F8C\u8DD6\u6C64","pneumonia","survival rate","significant therapeutic potential","activation normal T cells","combination","H1N1","intercellular adhesion molecule","antiviral drugs","distilled water","lung tissue","CONCLUSIONS","histological damage","ICAM","interleukin","LD","days","condition","suppression capacity","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The comparison of normal versus disease states can identify an overexpression or a suppression of critical proteins where illness has directly altered a patient\u0027s cellular homeostasis. In particular, the analysis of HIV-1 infected serum is an attractive medium with which to identify altered protein expression due to the ease and non-invasive methods of collecting samples as well as the corresponding insight into the in vivo interaction of the virus with infected cells/tissue. The utilization of proteomic techniques to globally identify differentially expressed serum proteins in response to HIV-1 infection is a significant undertaking that is complicated due to the innate protein profile of human serum. RESULTS: Here, the depletion of 12 of the most abundant serum proteins, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with identification of these proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, has allowed for the identification of differentially expressed, low abundant serum proteins. We have analyzed and compared serum samples from HIV-1 infected subjects who are being treated using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to those who are latently infected but have not progressed to AIDS despite the absence of treatment, i.e. long term non-progressors (LTNPs). Here we have identified unique serum proteins that are differentially expressed in LTNP HIV-1 patients and may contribute to the ability of these patients to combat HIV-1 infection in the absence of HAART. We focused on the cdk4/6 cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4A )and found that the treatment of HIV-1 latently infected cell lines with p16(INK4A )decreases viral production despite it not being expressed endogenously in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of these unique proteins may serve as an indication of altered viral states in response to infection as well as a natural phenotypic variability in response to HIV-1 infection in a given population.","publish_time":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Duyne, Rachel; Guendel, Irene; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Easley, Rebecca; Klase, Zachary; Liu, Chenglong; Young, Mary; Kashanchi, Fatah","journal":"AIDS Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ce8b2a6ee1373cf063fa46c1cdc81151babc7e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2908552.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-6405-7-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20604950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected serum","unique serum proteins","treatment of HIV","serum samples","unique proteins","low abundant serum proteins","infection","analysis of HIV","LTNP HIV","infected cells","response","suppression of critical proteins","infected subjects","identification","infected cell lines","innate protein profile of human serum","INK4A","disease states","indication of altered viral states","absence of treatment","altered protein expression","absence of HAART","patients","disease biomarkers","cell cycle inhibitor p16","viral production","human peripheral fluids","favorable approach","long term non-progressors","two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","flight","preventative therapeutics","ionization time","search","illness","laser desorption","interaction","matrix","overexpression","MALDI-TOF","natural phenotypic variability","past","LTNPs","mass spectrometry","cdk4","virus","non-invasive methods","significant undertaking","years","active antiretroviral therapy","corresponding insight","BACKGROUND","comparison of normal","tissue","AIDS","CONCLUSIONS","patient\u0027s cellular homeostasis","given population","utilization of proteomic techniques","depletion","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. RESULTS: There were 232 outpatients enrolled in our study, and 153 patients (65.9%) had positive test results, of which 26.7% were viruses, 19.4% were atypical pathogens and 19.8% were bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work.","publish_time":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jing; Li, Xiaoguang; Wang, Wei; Jia, Ying; Lin, Fei; Xu, Jie","journal":"Infect Drug Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b55aa037b62821a2bcf4463f30caba8c8e662e2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s213296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Klebsiella"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pneumonia","viral pathogens","atypical pneumonia pathogens","common pneumonia","atypical pathogens","bacterial pneumonia","viral infection","Community","common viruses","Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection","Streptococcus pneumoniae infection","respiratory pathogens","retrospective study of outpatients","identified bacteria","Klebsiella pneumoniae","viral-bacterial coinfection","large number of outpatients","common illness","IFVs","CAP","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","positive test results","Fever Clinic of Peking University","leading pathogen","Hospital","throat swabs","greater attention","clinical work","sputum","flu season","METHODS","adults","highest frequency","PIVs","Haemophilus influenza","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","RhV"],"language":"en"},

This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartenian, Ella; Gilbertson, Sarah; Federspiel, Joel D.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Glaunsinger, Britt A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbaf6a3ac63158b74ca6b50f01c98d56936a844d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7032723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032393/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol II"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay","MHV68-induced mRNA decay","mRNA endonuclease","widespread RNA decay","viral genome","reduced Pol","decay-induced transcript loss","Viral genes","regulation of multiple Pol","genome-wide reduction of Pol","widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation","mammalian cells","localization of viral DNA","occupancy","viral promoter sequences","mammalian promoters","impaired RNA polymerase","nucleus of infected cells","gammaherpesviruses","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","KSHV","TFIIB","mass spectrometry","replication compartments","subunits","infection","location","murine gammaherpesvirus","global measurements of protein abundance","means","ability","fact","Protection","model"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to GPV, the complete genomic sequence data of MDPV isolates are still limited and their phylogenetic relationships largely remain unknown. In this study, the entire genome of a pathogenic MDPV strain ZW, which was isolated from a deceased Muscovy duckling in 2006 in China, was cloned, sequenced, and compared with that of other classical MDPV and GPV strains. RESULTS: The genome of strain ZW comprises of 5071 nucleotides; this genome was shorter than that of the pathogenic MDPV strain YY (5075 nt). All the four deleted nucleotides produced in strain ZW are located at the base-pairing positions in the palindromic stem of inverted terminal repeats (ITR) without influencing the formation of a hairpin structure. Recombination analysis revealed that strain ZW originated from genetic recombination between the classical MDPV and GPV strain. The YY strain of MDPV acts as the major parent, whereas the virulent strains YZ99\u20136 and B and the vaccine strain SYG61v of GPV act as the minor parents in varying degrees. Two recombination sites were detected in strain ZW, with the small recombination site surrounding the P9 promoter, and the large recombination site situated in the middle of the VP3 gene. The SYG61V strain is a vaccine strain used for preventing goose parvoviral disease. This strain was found to be solely involved in the recombination event detected in the P9 promoter region. Phylogenetic analyses between strain ZW and other classical strains of MDPV and GPV were performed. The results supported the in silico recombination analysis conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: MDPV Strain ZW is a novel recombinant parvovirus, and the bulk of its genome originates from the classical MDPV strain. Two virulent strains and a vaccine strain of GPV were involved in the recombination process in varying degrees.","publish_time":"2017-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jianye; Ling, Jueyi; Wang, Zhixian; Huang, Yu; Zhu, Jianzhong; Zhu, Guoqiang","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377460ce717fe498f2332550d0dfd70db1ca8fd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5680767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121936/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1238-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDPV","GPV","MDPV Strain ZW"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["classical MDPV strain","genome of strain ZW","SYG61V strain","pathogenic MDPV strain ZW","vaccine strain of GPV","pathogenic MDPV strain YY","YY strain of MDPV acts","classical strains of MDPV","vaccine strain SYG61v of GPV act","GPV strains","genetic recombination","recombination event","recombination process","recombination sites","small recombination site","large recombination site","silico recombination analysis conclusion","Muscovy duck parvovirus","Muscovy duck parvoviral disease","Goose parvovirus","complete genomic sequence data of MDPV isolates","entire genome","goose parvoviral disease","virulent strains YZ99","Derzsy\u2019s disease","varying degrees","RESULTS","novel recombinant parvovirus","P9 promoter region","deceased Muscovy duckling","Phylogenetic analyses","deleted nucleotides","phylogenetic relationships","important etiological agents","major parent","palindromic stem of inverted terminal repeats","minor parents","ITR","middle","substantial economic losses","waterfowl industry","positions","bulk","base","BACKGROUND","formation","China","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","hairpin structure","VP3 gene","study"],"language":"en"},

Animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci. We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children. Methods. A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children \u003C3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study). Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization. We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes. Results. A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes. The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02\u20134.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15\u20133.01), when compared with episodes without ARI. Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition. Conclusions. Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children. As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease.","publish_time":"2014-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grijalva, Carlos G.; Griffin, Marie R.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Williams, John V.; Gil, Ana I.; Verastegui, Hector; Hartinger, Stella M.; Vidal, Jorge E.; Klugman, Keith P.; Lanata, Claudio F.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de37edb6bd7020a8232ed2637ec60b177039f9c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4001292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621951/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/58/10/1369/17351427/ciu148.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal acquisition episodes","risk of pneumococcal acquisition","pneumococcal colonization","specific respiratory viral ARI episodes","parainfluenza-ARI","risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes","following influenza-ARI","risk of pneumococcal diseases","nonacquisition episodes","episodes of observation","indeterminate episodes","nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci","young children","respiratory viruses","influenza infection","NP samples","Andean children","respiratory syncytial virus","viral detection","viral infections","new serotype","prior sample","persistent colonization","AOR","prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness","RESPIRA-PERU study","case-control study","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","confidence interval","parainfluenza ARIs","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","adjusted odds ratio","years of age","nasal swabs","observations","attempts","adenovirus","Animal models","relationship","Weekly household visits","total","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

However, clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection with other pathogens were unclear. This study aimed to investigate the viral and atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI in children and compare the clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection with those of coinfection. METHODS: This study included 1335 patients, aged between 1 to 71 months, diagnosed with LRTI in Yuying Children\u0027s Hospital, Zhejiang, China, from December 2013 to June 2015. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, and respiratory pathogens were detected using Multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data of patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: At least 1 pathogen was detected in 1181/1335 (88.5%) patients. The pathogens identified most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, HPIV, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. The coinfection rate was 24.8%. HPIV coinfection with other viruses was more associated with running nose, shortness of breath, and oxygen support compared with HPIV single infection. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more related to running nose, moist rales, and longer hospital duration compared with HPIV single infection, and also to longer hospital duration compared with coinfection with other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that viral infections were highly associated with LRTI and the rate of coinfection was high. HPIV single infection was milder than coinfection with other viruses. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more serious than HPIV single infection and coinfection with other viruses.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Peipei; Zhang, Hailin; Chen, Xiaofang; Lv, Fangfang","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57692350a6ce9d89e71f11fdf8f2e6586489d4e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166436.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPIV","LRTI","Multiplex"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection","coinfection rate","rate of coinfection","clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection","viruses","respiratory pathogens","study","lower respiratory tract infection","longer hospital duration","atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI","clinical data of patients","respiratory syncytial virus","human rhinovirus","Human parainfluenza virus","human metapneumovirus","running nose","Yuying Children\u0027s Hospital","viral infections","moist rales","oxygen support","shortness of breath","Zhejiang","adenovirus","Multiplex polymerase chain reaction","China","BACKGROUND","Nasopharyngeal secretions","months","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is upregulated in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with unknown roles. In the present approach, cytosolic CYPA was found to be bound with EBNA1 into the nucleus. The amino acid 376-459 of the EBNA1 domain was important for the binding. CYPA depletion attenuated and ectopic CYPA expression improved EBNA1 expression in EBV-positive cells. The loss of viral copy number was also accelerated by CYPA consumption in daughter cells during culture passages. Mechanistically, CYPA mediated the connection of EBNA1 with oriP (origin of EBV DNA replication) and subsequent oriP transcription, which is a key step for the initiation of EBV genome replication. Moreover, CYPA overexpression markedly antagonized the connection of EBNA1 to Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), which is a strong host barrier with a role of inhibiting EBV genome replication. The PPIase activity of CYPA was required for the promotion of oriP transcription and antagonism with USP7. The results revealed a strategy that EBV recruited a host factor to counteract the host defense, thus facilitating its own latent genome replication. This study provides a new insight into EBV pathogenesis and potential virus-targeted therapeutics in EBV-associated NPC, in which CYPA is upregulated at all stages.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xin, Shuyu; Du, Shujuan; Liu, Lingzhi; Xie, Yan; Zuo, Lielian; Yang, Jing; Hu, Jingjin; Yue, Wenxing; Zhang, Jing; Cao, Pengfei; Zhu, Fanxiu; Lu, Jianhong","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3f515c47fec377ecc7f3961948916239e4e079f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6923202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921057/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02879","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CYPA","EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV pathogenesis","CYPA consumption","CYPA depletion","cytosolic CYPA","CYPA overexpression","initiation of EBV genome replication","EBV-associated NPC","origin of EBV DNA replication","EBV-positive cells","role of inhibiting EBV genome replication","connection of EBNA1","PPIase activity of CYPA","ectopic CYPA expression improved EBNA1 expression","EBNA1 domain","latent genome replication","mediated DNA episomal genome replication","subsequent oriP transcription","promotion of oriP transcription","host factor","viral pathogenesis","host defense","USP7","strong host barrier","daughter cells","Epstein-Barr virus","potential virus-targeted therapeutics","loss of viral copy number","persistence","new insight","nuclear antigen","key step","Ubiquitin-specific protease","culture passages","nasopharyngeal carcinoma","antagonism","strategy","unknown roles","binding","present approach","study","results","amino acid","nucleus","stages","Cyclophilin"],"language":"en"},

Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1-like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF(4)(\u2212)) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the \u03B219\u2013\u03B220 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly.

The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies. RESULTS: Following our original approach, in the present report we provide an updated classification of HLA-A and -B class I alleles into supertypes. The present analysis incorporates the large amount of class I MHC binding data and sequence information that has become available in the last decade. As a result, over 80% of the 945 different HLA-A and -B alleles examined to date can be assigned to one of the original nine supertypes. A few alleles are expected to be associated with repertoires that overlap multiple supertypes. Interestingly, the current analysis did not identify any additional supertype specificities. CONCLUSION: As a result of this updated analysis, HLA supertype associations have been defined for over 750 different HLA-A and -B alleles. This information is expected to facilitate epitope identification and vaccine design studies, as well as investigations into disease association and correlates of immunity. In addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.","publish_time":"2008-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sidney, John; Peters, Bjoern; Frahm, Nicole; Brander, Christian; Sette, Alessandro","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2245908.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-9-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18211710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different HLA","B alleles","B class","updated classification of HLA","present analysis","HLA supertype associations","original supertype classification","peptide repertoires","classification approach","original approach","peptide-binding repertoire","updated analysis","presented peptide","multiple supertypes","large extent","large number of epitope identification studies","present report","sets of molecules","current analysis","polymorphism","different groups","decade","MHC binding data","main anchor specificity","additional supertype specificities","so-called main anchor positions","sequence information","vaccine design studies","molecular structure","short peptides","concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen","investigations","T cells","specific molecule","histocompatibility complex","disease association","intracellular processing of proteins","basis","correlates of immunity","BACKGROUND","utility","RESULTS","subsequent arrangements","receptors","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Methods We telephoned all hospitals in the UK listed as having a major ED. We surveyed their ED facilities and procedures for managing patients with infectious diseases. We determined how many of the EDs had an isolation room available and, if present, whether this had an independent ventilation system and separate access from outside the ED. In addition, we determined how many of the EDs would isolate patients with suspected cases of chickenpox, tuberculosis (TB), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other suspicious infections. Results We obtained complete data from 203 (79%) of the 257 hospitals approached. Only 49 (24%) of these hospitals had isolation facilities available in the ED. Of these 49 EDs, 30 (61%) reported an independent ventilation system and 18 (37%) reported a separate access from outside the ED. The majority of EDs would isolate patients with potential infectious diseases, however, 47 (23%) would not isolate patients with suspected chickenpox, 37 (18%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected TB, 12 (6%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected SARS and 55 (27%) EDS would not isolate patients with other suspicious infections. Conclusion EDs in the UK are not prepared for emerging biological threats and bioterrorism. With current facilities and procedures it is highly likely that an infectious agent will spread to staff and other patients in any future biological incident.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anathallee, Mohammad; Curphey, Andrew; Beeching, Nick; Carley, Simon; Crawford, Ian; Mackway-Jones, Kevin","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe50d2b01a957b6186f6cf73fa4135815bd4d16a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112611.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445306001393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445306001393","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["UK","EDS","SARS"],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["patients","majority of EDs","Conclusion EDs","suspected TB","suspected SARS","UK","suspected chickenpox","hospitals","suspected cases of chickenpox","isolation facilities available","potential infectious diseases","procedures","ED facilities","infectious agent","independent ventilation system","current facilities","separate access","suspicious infections","management of potential biological incidents","isolation room available","emerging biological threats","future biological incident","tuberculosis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","preparedness of emergency departments","present","staff","United Kingdom","bioterrorism","Summary Objective","complete data","addition","Methods"],"language":"en"},

It also leads to substantial unintended impacts when introduced species become invasive, causing environmental disturbance or transmitting diseases that affect people, livestock, other wildlife or the environment. Policy responses are usually only implemented after these species become established and damages are already incurred. International agreements to control trade are likewise usually based on selection of species with known impacts. We aim to further develop quantitative invasive species risk assessment for bird imports and extend the tool to explicitly address disease threats. LOCATION: United States of America. METHODS: We use a two\u2010step approach for rapid risk assessment based on the expected biological risks due to both the environmental and health impact of a potentially invasive wildlife species in trade. We assess establishment probability based on a model informed by historical observations and then construct a model of emerging infectious disease threat based on economic and ecological characteristics of the exporting country. RESULTS: We illustrate how our rapid assessment tool can be used to identify high\u2010priority species for regulation based on a combination of the threat they pose for becoming established and vectoring emerging infectious diseases. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our approach can be executed for a species in a matter of days and is nested in an economic decision\u2010making framework for determining whether the biological risk is justified by trade benefits.","publish_time":"2014-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springborn, Michael R.; Keller, Reuben P.; Elwood, Sarah; Romagosa, Christina M.; Zambrana\u2010Torrelio, Carlos; Daszak, Peter","journal":"Divers Distrib","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7faefee16cb46a03b8511d98b62f7925d946e9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313433/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["invasive wildlife species","selection of species","priority species","quantitative invasive species risk assessment","trade benefits","International trade","rapid risk assessment","rapid assessment tool","significant economic benefits","model of emerging infectious disease threat","emerging infectious diseases","AIM","economic decision\u2010making framework","environmental disturbance","transmitting diseases","two\u2010step approach","disease threats","known impacts","International agreements","expected biological risks","substantial unintended impacts","plants","bird imports","animals","ecological characteristics","livestock","people","health impact","regulation","exporting country","LOCATION","United States of America","historical observations","combination","matter of days","MAIN CONCLUSIONS","establishment probability","METHODS","damages","Policy responses","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus associated with respiratory tract infections and wheezing. Our aim was to determine whether hMPV was associated with exacerbations of COPD. Methods The study was designed as an observational cohort study carried out in a 944-bed urban teaching hospital located in New Haven, Connecticut. Between December 2002 and May 2003, patients hospitalized due to an exacerbation of COPD were identified. Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from these patients were tested for human metapneumovirus by RT\u2013PCR and for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, -2, and -3 and adenovirus by a cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluorescence assay and/or viral culture. Results Fifty individuals met enrollment criteria and hMPV was identified in 6 (12%), respiratory syncytial virus in 4 (8%), influenza A in 2 (4%) and parainfluenza type 3 in 1 (2%) patients. Both A and B hMPV genotypes were identified in patients hospitalized due to exacerbations of COPD. Conclusion hMPV was frequently identified in patients hospitalized due to an exacerbation of COPD. Further studies are necessary to determine the epidemiology and the impact of hMPV in COPD patients.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinello, Richard A.; Esper, Frank; Weibel, Carla; Ferguson, David; Landry, Marie L.; Kahn, Jeffrey S.","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cb73a468d64c1c851c99c626d517e6d3bc3ad4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112509.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445305003725; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445305003725","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":["Connecticut"],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","exacerbations of COPD","exacerbation of COPD","impact of hMPV","Conclusion hMPV","B hMPV genotypes","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract infections","Human metapneumovirus","Summary Objective Respiratory viruses","parainfluenza type","exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","observational cohort study","common trigger","PCR","New Haven","direct immunofluorescence assay","bed urban teaching hospital","paramyxovirus","cytospin","epidemiology","individuals","enrollment criteria","viral culture","Results","Connecticut","wheezing","studies","adenovirus","Nasopharyngeal specimens","Methods","aim"],"language":"en"},

The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality. CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism. Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia. Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3. How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge. No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date.

However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described. During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle \u0026 King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility. On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results. The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved. A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later. This resident was asymptomatic on both days. Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting. When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roxby, Alison C.; Greninger, Alexander L.; Hatfield, Kelly M.; Lynch, John B.; Dellit, Timothy H.; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Page, Libby C.; Kimball, Anne; Arons, Melissa; Schieve, Laura A.; Munanga, Albert; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Lewis, James; Cohen, Seth A.; Jerome, Keith R.; Duchin, Jeffrey S.; Neme, Santiago","journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb30feab1d93719cfc28894e87e0613c6562a857.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147909.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UW Medicine","CDC"],"locations":["Washington","United States"],"keyphrases":["residents of senior independent","cases of COVID","confirmed COVID","assisted living community","potential outbreak of COVID","assisted living communities","Seattle SNFs","facility outbreak","staff members","days","Public Health - Seattle","positive test results","community-level outbreak","high morbidity","residential community","negative test results","mortality","initial phase","health care providers","health system","social distancing","symptoms","SARS-CoV","skilled nursing services","long-term care skilled nursing facilities","protective measures","preventive measures","University of Washington","CDC guidance","evidence of rapid spread","Washington metropolitan area","older adults","early implementation of stringent isolation","symptom screening","identification","contact","transmission","King County","case of novel coronavirus","addition","disease","UW Medicine","persons","time of testing","investigation","Adherence","infection","type of setting","Possible explanations","questionnaire","earlier cough","United States"],"language":"en"},

However, limited information is available about host immune responses induced by the inactivated SARS vaccine. In this study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV inactivated by \u03B2-propiolactone elicited high titers of antibodies in the immunized mice and rabbits that recognize the spike (S) protein, especially the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region. The antisera from the immunized animals efficiently bound to the RBD and blocked binding of RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on the susceptible cells for SARS-CoV. With a sensitive and quantitative single-cycle infection assay using pseudovirus bearing the SARS-CoV S protein, we demonstrated that mouse and rabbit antisera significantly inhibited S protein-mediated virus entry with mean 50% inhibitory titers of 1:7393 and 1:2060, respectively. These data suggest that the RBD of S protein is a major neutralization determinant in the inactivated SARS vaccine which can induce potent neutralizing antibodies to block SARS-CoV entry.

We added over 1200 nucleotides from four nuclear genes to a dataset derived from three genes to produce a dataset of over 3000 nucleotides per taxon. While the number of well-supported short branches in the phylogeny increased, we still did not obtain strong bootstrap support for every node. Parametric and nonparametric bootstrap simulations projected that an enormous, and likely unobtainable, amount of data would be required to get bootstrap support greater than 50% for every node. However, a marked increase in the number of well-supported nodes was seen when we conducted a Bayesian analysis of a combined dataset generated from morphological characters added to the seven gene dataset.

Nurses are world\u2019s largest health professional workforce and a critical resource for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Nonetheless, little is known about nurses\u2019 engagement with dual practice. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on nurses\u2019 dual practice with the objective of generating hypotheses on its nature and consequences, and define a research agenda on the phenomenon. The Arksey and O\u2019Malley\u2019s methodological steps were followed to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/exclude studies, extract the data, and report the findings. PRISMA guidelines were additionally used to conduct the review and report on results. RESULTS: Of the initial 194 records identified, a total of 35 met the inclusion criteria for nurses\u2019 dual practice; the vast majority (65%) were peer-reviewed publications, followed by nursing magazine publications (19%), reports, and doctoral dissertations. Twenty publications focused on high-income countries, 16 on low- or middle-income ones, and two had a multi country perspective. Although holding multiple jobs not always amounted to dual practice, several ways were found for public-sector nurses to engage concomitantly in public and private employments, in regulated as well as in informal, casual fashions. Some of these forms were reported as particularly prevalent, from over 50% in Australia, Canada, and the UK, to 28% in South Africa. The opportunity to increase a meagre salary, but also a dissatisfaction with the main job and the flexibility offered by multiple job-holding arrangements, were among the reported reasons for engaging in these practices. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Limited and mostly circumstantial evidence exists on nurses\u2019 dual practice, with the few existing studies suggesting that the phenomenon is likely to be very common and carry implications for health systems and nurses\u2019 welfare worldwide. We offer an agenda for future research to consolidate the existing evidence and to further explore nurses\u2019 motivation; without a better understanding of nurse dual practice, this will continue to be a largely \u2018hidden\u2019 element in nursing workforce policy and practice, with an unclear impact on the delivery of care.

Many nursing home residents have dementia, associated with impairments in memory, language, insight and judgment that impact their ability to understand and appreciate the necessity of isolation and to voluntarily comply with isolation procedures. While there is a clear ethical and legal basis for the involuntary confinement of people with dementia, the potential for unintended harm with these interventions is high, and there is little guidance for nursing homes on how to isolate safely, while maintaining the human dignity and personhood of the individual with dementia.

AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e. Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses). To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice. Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice. Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets. Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues. The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier. Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present.","publish_time":"2018-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barr, Jennifer; Todd, Shawn; Crameri, Gary; Foord, Adam; Marsh, Glenn; Frazer, Leah; Payne, Jean; Harper, Jenni; Baker, Kate S.; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Wood, James L.

Investigators determined that 80% to 85% of school-aged children with wheezing episodes were tested positive for virus. To more fully understand how viral respiratory tract infections influence asthma, investigators have evaluated the effect of respiratory tract injections on airway symptoms, function, and inflammation. Although the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses enhance lower airway inflammation are not established, cytokines may play a key role in this process. The respiratory epithelial cell is a principal host for respiratory virus replication und is likely to be the first source of cytokines during an acute infection. T cells orchestrate immune responses to both allergens and viruses, and regulate effector cells with virucidal and proinflammalory effects. Although studies demonstrate that virus-specific T cells may contribute to virus-induced lung disease, evidence to define the role of virus-specific T lymphocytes in asthma has not been fully established. Some injections early in life may also have an important immunoregular role in the subsequent development of allergy and asthma. Atopy is characterised by exaggerated Th-2 cell responses to commun allergens with secretion of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 that promote IgE production and eosinophil activation. In contrast, childhood injections typically induce a Th-1 cell response, characterised by secretion oj interferon-\u03B3 which enhances the antiviral activities of effector cells. These two types of T cell responses are mutually antagonistic.","publish_time":"1999-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, J; Freymuth, F; Vabret, A; Toutain, F; Duhamel, J.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes diarrhea in swine of all ages, is a worldwide-distributed alphacoronavirus with economic importance. Here, we screened PEDV RNA modification enzymes involved in regulating antiviral response. Whereas the PEDV nsp13 barely regulates type I IFN, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a) and MHCII, nsp16 and nsp14 (to a lesser extent) down-regulate these antiviral effectors. Importantly, we found nsp16 KDKE tetrad appears to play a key role in interferon inhibition by mutating the D129 catalytic residue. Mechanistically, nsp16 down-regulates the activities of RIG-I and MDA5 mediated IFN-\u03B2 and ISRE. In turn, the mRNA levels of IFIT family members (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) was inhibited in cells overexpressing nsp16. In addition, nsp10 enhanced the inhibitory effect of nsp16 on IFN-\u03B2.

Infrared thermography (IRT) of the thorax might provide a new method of high specificity to select swine affected with lung alterations for further diagnostics. In this study, layer thickness of different tissues was determined in frozen thorax slices (FTS) by computed tomography (CT) and then related to skin temperatures measured by IRT in healthy pigs. The aim was to determine appropriate regions of interest (ROI) for evaluation of IRT images. Organ layer thicknesses measured in CT images correspond to those measured in FTS. Temperature differences between lung ROIs and abdomen ROIs were positively correlated with lung layer thickness at certain localizations, and negatively correlated with the thickness of the thorax wall and of inner organ layers.

Our recent study indicated that SARS-CoV infection induces activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the p38 MAPK inhibitor partially inhibited its cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells. The results of the present study indicated that before cell death, Akt, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis, was also activated in response to viral replication. Phosphorylation of a serine residue on Akt was detected at least 8 h postinfection (hpi), which declined after 18 hpi. Thus, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells. However, a threonine residue was not phosphorylated. A downstream target of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03B2 (GSK-3\u03B2), was slightly phosphorylated, indicating that the level of activation of Akt was very low. PKC\u03B6, which is downstream of the PI3K pathway, was also phosphorylated in virus-infected cells.

Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on the surface of virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with a rise in the pH of the Golgi lumen. We demonstrate that infection with IBV induces neutralization of Golgi luminal pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cells factors, protecting IBV spike protein (S) from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells.","publish_time":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Westerbeck, Jason W.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6312e7233ad4c0780492db3c05a61abe4fb6b22.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e3a3825c5ad7c453861d4ed5d6e3c91da837333c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/440628","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IBV S","IBV WT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HD of IBV E","IBV spike protein","monomeric form of IBV E correlates","accumulation of IBV S protein","distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E","IBV WT infected cells","express E mutants","aberrant cleavage of IBV S","small CoV E protein plays roles","secretory pathway","independent of E ion channel activity","Golgi lumen","impaired release of infectious virions","secretory system","Golgi membranes","early Golgi","efficient release of infectious virus","host cells factors","virion release","pathogenic human CoVs","CoV envelope","neutralization of Golgi luminal pH","avian infectious bronchitis virus","cation channel activity","infection results","premature cleavage","dramatic effects","surface of virions","impaired growth kinetics","important human pathogens","significant zoonotic potential","potential vaccine candidates","assembly","plasma membrane","interaction","use of attenuated viruses","single hydrophobic domain","model","rise","approved vaccines","anti-viral therapeutics","Mutation","formation","pathogenesis","residues","present evidence","Coronaviruses","exocytosis","Disruption","Progress"],"language":"en"},

To develop an effective vaccine that does not enhance RSV illness, it is important to understand how formalin and heat inactivation affected the antigenicity and immunogenicity of FI-RSV compared to native virus. Informed by atomic structures of RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein in prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations, we demonstrate that FI-RSV predominately presents post-F on the virion surface, whereas infectious RSV presents both pre-F and post-F conformations. This significant antigenic distinction has not been previously appreciated. Thus, a stabilized pre-F antigen is more representative of live RSV than F in its post-F conformation, as displayed on the surface of FI-RSV.

Although some rate-limiting steps of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway are well known, the specific roles of gene family members in I. indigotica in regulating lariciresinol production are poorly understood. In the present study, a correlation analysis between the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) expression profile and lignan content by using I. indigotica hairy roots treated with methyl jamonate (0.5 \u03BCM) at different time points as a source implicated that I. indigotica pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase 1 (IiPLR1), but not IiPLR2 or IiPLR3, contributed greatly to lariciresinol accumulation. Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that IiPLR1 indeed influenced lariciresinol biosynthesis, whereas suppression of IiPLR2 or IiPLR3 did not change lariciresinol abundance significantly. IiPLR1 was thus further characterized; IiPLR1 was constitutively expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of I. indigotica, with the highest expression in roots, and it responds to different stress treatments to various degrees. Recombinant IiPLR1 reduces both (\u00B1)-pinoresinol and (\u00B1)-lariciresinol efficiently, with comparative K(cat)/K(m) values. Furthermore, overexpression of IiPLR1 significantly enhanced lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica hairy roots, and the best line (ovx-2) produced 353.9 \u03BCg g(\u20131) lariciresinol, which was ~6.3-fold more than the wild type. This study sheds light on how to increase desired metabolites effectively by more accurate or appropriate genetic engineering strategies, and also provides an effective approach for the large-scale commercial production of pharmaceutically valuable lariciresinol by using hairy root culture systems as bioreactors.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Ying; Ji, Qian; Gao, Shouhong; Tan, Hexin; Chen, Ruibing; Li, Qing; Chen, Junfeng; Yang, Yingbo; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Zhengtao; Chen, Wansheng; Hu, Zhibi","journal":"J Exp Bot","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08e3267072279684e25f8f51a78bf2ec534fbfdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163698/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erv333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["I. indigotica"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lariciresinol production","valuable lariciresinol","lariciresinol reductase","lariciresinol abundance","enhanced lariciresinol accumulation","indigotica hairy roots","influenced lariciresinol biosynthesis","lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway","indigotica pinoresinol","overexpression of IiPLR1","Recombinant IiPLR1","antiviral effect of Isatis indigotica","RNA-Seq","RNA sequencing","RNA interference","IiPLR3","hairy root culture systems","lignan content","expression profile","Gene silencing","highest expression","suppression of IiPLR2","present study","large-scale commercial production","different stress treatments","different time points","study sheds light","specific roles of gene family members","RNAi","important efficacious compound","correlation analysis","methyl jamonate","\u03BCM","source","appropriate genetic engineering strategies","effective approach","best line","desired metabolites","various degrees","bioreactors","herb","steps","leaves","treatment of colds","fever","ovx","flowers of","\u03BCg g","fold","wild type","influenza","cat","values"],"language":"en"},

As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, spray dried plasma is considered one of the most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of spray dried plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of spray dried plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of spray dried animal plasma. Particular attention is given to studies in which spray dried plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products. Several studies on the possible modes of action for spray dried plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed. Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of spray dried plasma from porcine origin. Overall, spray dried plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase. Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial spray dried porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs.","publish_time":"2016-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez-Bosque, Anna; Polo, Javier; Torrallardona, David","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bce7709e22e3d5a110cb77501f6d97db10d9c05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382520.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-016-0034-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["use of spray dried plasma","commercial spray dried porcine plasma","biosafety of spray dried animal plasma","use of antibiotics","therapeutic antibiotics","use of growth","existing studies","promising alternative","alternative antimicrobial products","porcine origin","existing evidence","paper","review","possible mechanisms of action","possible modes of action","recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak","piglet feed","recent publications","feed antimicrobials","antimicrobial resistance","weaned pig diets","re-emergence of swine diseases","modulation","preservation of gut barrier function","North America","risks of disease transmission","safe product","early stages","different regions","world","periods of emergence","post-weaning phase","decades","piglets","concerning subject","potential alternatives","immune response","pigs","Particular attention","humans","objectives","result"],"language":"en"},

However, due to the overwhelming public health impact of this virus, a vaccine is needed urgently. Despite the tireless efforts of scientist and clinicians, there is still no safe and effective vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity. A vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity against HIV infection remains elusive in part due to the following reasons: 1) degree of diversity of the virus, 2) ability of the virus to evade the hosts\u2019 immunity, and 3) lack of appropriate animal models in which to test vaccine candidates. There have been several attempts to stimulate the immune system to provide protection against HIV-infection. Here, we will discuss attempts that have been made to induce sterilizing immunity, including traditional vaccination attempts, induction of broadly neutralizing antibody production, DNA vaccines, and use of viral vectors. Some of these attempts show promise pending continued research efforts.","publish_time":"2010-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gamble, Lena J; Matthews, Qiana L","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16715be315ab1392947070e15252a60ae2b745f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3023272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21267356/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s6959","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sterilizing immunity","HIV infection","HIV-infection","hosts\u2019 immunity","effective vaccine","vaccine candidates","treatment of human immunodeficiency virus","traditional vaccination attempts","immune system","continued research efforts","tireless efforts of scientist","neutralizing antibody production","induction","DNA vaccines","lack of appropriate animal models","overwhelming public health impact","clinicians","success","promise","protection","degree of diversity","characterization","following reasons","viral vectors","discovery","ability"],"language":"en"},

The most common reason for being vaccinated over the 5 years was the perception of influenza as a serious illness, which people want to avoid. The main reason for not getting vaccinated among those never previously vaccinated was feeling that they were unlikely to catch influenza. A recommendation by the family physician was the most encouraging factor for vaccination.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holm, Majbrit V.; Blank, Patricia R.; Szucs, Thomas D.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a618a87ac05377d6f665251c756bc2e8f77d34e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941886.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19453429/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2008.00036.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years","perception of influenza","Overall influenza vaccination coverage","main reason","common reason","barriers","potential drivers","family physician","encouraging factor","serious illness","household surveys","general population","Objective","European countries","Methods","recommendation","people","elderly","rate"],"language":"en"},

Currently, only a few vaccine candidates and therapeutic drugs are being developed for the treatment of ZIKV infections, and as of yet none are commercially available. The polyanionic aromatic compound aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been shown to have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated ATA as a potential antiviral drug against ZIKV replication. The antiviral activity of ATA against ZIKV replication in vitro showed median inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 13.87 \u00B1 1.09 \u03BCM and 33.33 \u00B1 1.13 \u03BCM in Vero and A549 cells, respectively; without showing any cytotoxic effect in both cell lines (median cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) \u003E 1,000 \u03BCM). Moreover, ATA protected both cell types from ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, pre-treatment of Vero cells with ATA for up to 72 h also resulted in effective suppression of ZIKV replication with similar IC(50). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of ATA on ZIKV infection was effective against strains of the African and Asian/American lineages, indicating that this inhibitory effect was not strain dependent. Overall, these results demonstrate that ATA has potent inhibitory activity against ZIKV replication and may be considered as a potential anti-ZIKV therapy for future clinical evaluation.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jun-Gyu; \u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gin\u00E9s; Madere, Ferralita; Hilimire, Thomas A.; Nogales, Aitor; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4648b12f07c46586cff25b47a85a0f5b6167620e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6473159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031722/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00718","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["inhibitory effect of ATA","antiviral activity of ATA","effective suppression of ZIKV replication","treatment of ZIKV infections","potential anti-ZIKV therapy","cytotoxic effect","\u03BCM","potent inhibitory activity","cytopathic effect","median inhibitory concentrations","median cytotoxic concentration","potential antiviral drug","pre-treatment of Vero cells","concentration-dependent manner","cell lines","cell types","similar IC","A549 cells","humans","future clinical evaluation","microcephaly","severe congenital abnormalities","time","polyanionic aromatic compound aurintricarboxylic acid","apoptosis","strains","CPE","American lineages","viruses","therapeutic drugs","vaccine candidates","emerging vector","addition","results","Western Hemisphere","Zika virus","study"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this research was to study the genetic characteristics of EV-D68 strains that were circulating in Italy identified during an outbreak of an EV-D68 infection that occurred in Italy during the period March-October 2016. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of the circulation of different types and subtypes of EV-D68 was performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from March 2016 through October 2016 in children admitted to the Emergency Room with respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Among 390 children, 22 (59.1% males; mean age 47 months) were found to be infected by EV-D68 and most of them were immunocompetent (72.7%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 12 (54.5%) children. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region showed that all the strains identified in this study belonged to clade B3. Within B3 subclade, the Italian EV-D68 strains were most closely related to strains detected in Southern China in 2015 as well as to strains detected in US and the Netherlands in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that EV-D68 infections are a common cause of lower respiratory illness in pediatric age. The circulation of one EV-D68 lineage has been proven in Italy and in the European region during 2016. However, further studies are required to investigate whether some strains or lineages may possess a higher affinity for the lower airway or central nervous system.","publish_time":"2018-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piralla, Antonio; Principi, Nicola; Ruggiero, Luca; Girello, Alessia; Giardina, Federica; De Sando, Elisabetta; Caimmi, Silvia; Bianchini, Sonia; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Lunghi, Giovanna; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0079559ab8717d83bc3df6be8533ff9672bb4367.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396353/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300052; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern China","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["Italian EV-D68 strains","EV-D68 infections","EV-D68 lineage","subtypes of EV","genetic characteristics of EV","Italy","children","respiratory diseases","retrospective study","STUDY DESIGN","lower respiratory tract diseases","lower airway","common cause of lower respiratory illness","RESULTS","pediatric age","mean age","VP1 region","B3 subclade","European region","clade B3","circulation of different types","higher affinity","central nervous system","outbreaks","research","males","Enterovirus D","Emergency Room","recent years","main aim","Phylogenetic analysis","months","lineages","development of neurological problems","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","Southern China","Netherlands","CONCLUSIONS","Nasopharyngeal swabs","period","Pneumonia","studies"],"language":"en"},

Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). OBJECTIVE: to assess the change in QTc interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from two centers, diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. RESULTS: QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to \u003E 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 23% of patients. One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting extreme QTc prolongation was normal. CONCLUSION: The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chorin, Ehud; Wadhwani, Lalit; Magnani, Silvia; Dai, Matthew; Shulman, Eric; Nadeau-Routhier, Charles; Knotts, Robert; Bar-Cohen, Roi; Kogan, Edward; Barbhaiya, Chirag; Aizer, Anthony; Holmes, Douglas; Bernstein, Scott; Spinelli, Michael; Park, David S.; Stefano, Carugo; Chinitz, Larry A.; Jankelson, Lior","journal":"Heart Rhythm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e28216d206bdf411652342f178ac046c76313e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527120304355?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527120304355","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HY/AZ","TdP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["baseline QTc of patients","extreme QTc prolongation","QTc interval","progression of QTc","AZ therapy","COVID","Extreme new QTc prolongation","combination of HY","Strict QTc monitoring","completion of therapy","potential risk of QT prolongation","AZ METHODS","form of TdP","known effective therapy","risk mandates careful consideration of HY","Initial reports","premature termination of therapy","regimen","known marker of high risk","incidence of arrhythmia","unproven efficacy","true efficacy","potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine","life threating arrhythmia","concerns","induction of torsade","ms","arrhythmic events","VT","change","Azithromycin","lights","polymorphic ventricular tachycardia","increasing drug exposure","retrospective study","pointes","days","ECG tracings","massive adoption","mortality","centers","BACKGROUND","emergent cardioversion","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Its intestinal expression depends on co-expression of the membrane-anchored peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is additionally enhanced by aminopeptidase N (CD13). We investigated in this study the expression of B(0)AT1 and its auxiliary peptidases as well as its transport function along the rat small intestine. Additionally, we tested its possible short- and long-term regulation by dietary proteins and amino acids. We showed by immunofluorescence that B(0)AT1, ACE2 and CD13 co-localize on the luminal membrane of small intestinal villi and by Western blotting that their protein expression increases in distal direction. Furthermore, we observed an elevated transport activity of the neutral amino acid L-isoleucine during the nocturnal active phase compared to the inactive one. Gastric emptying was delayed by intragastric application of an amino acid cocktail but we observed no acute dietary regulation of B(0)AT1 protein expression and L-isoleucine transport. Investigation of the chronic dietary regulation of B(0)AT1, ACE2 and CD13 by different diets revealed an increased B(0)AT1 protein expression under amino acid-supplemented diet in the proximal section but not in the distal one and for ACE2 protein expression a reverse localization of the effect. Dietary regulation for CD13 protein expression was not as distinct as for the two other proteins. Ring uptake experiments showed a tendency for increased L-isoleucine uptake under amino acid-supplemented diet and in vivo L-isoleucine absorption was more efficient under high protein and amino acid-supplemented diet. Additionally, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids were elevated under high protein and amino acid diet. Taken together, our experiments did not reveal an acute amino acid-induced regulation of B(0)AT1 but revealed a chronic dietary adaptation mainly restricted to the proximal segment of the small intestine.","publish_time":"2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jando, Julia; Camargo, Simone M.

This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19. Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC(50) concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC(50)s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bleasel, Martin D.; Peterson, Gregory M.","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/424e4db47326c58fb993570b87dacd2cb55a84d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245264/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13030051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["concentrations of emetine","effects of emetine","likely ability of emetine","potential treatment of COVID","potential treatment options","coronaviruses","therapeutic concentrations","coronavirus poses","studies","limited treatment options available","analogues","relative EC","lungs","amoebiasis","anti-coronavirus agent","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","ipecac alkaloids","lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration","MERS","long history","SARS","globe","old drugs","related compounds","optimal method of administration","blood","immediate threat","Entamoeba histolytica","rationale","agents","times higher","viral sensitivity","paper","article"],"language":"en"},

These altered membranes serve as scaffolds for the assembly of viral replication factories (RFs). We have recently shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) representing the major constituent of the RF within the infected cell. RF formation requires the concerted action of nonstructural action of nonstructural protein (NS)3, -4A, protein (NS)3 -4A, -4B, -5A, and -5B. Although the sole expression of NS5A is sufficient to induce DMV formation, its efficiency is very low. In this study, we dissected the determinants within NS5A responsible for DMV formation and found that RNA-binding domain 1 (D1) and the amino-terminal membrane anchor are indispensable for this process. In contrast, deletion of NS5A D2 or D3 did not affect DMV formation but disrupted RNA replication and virus assembly, respectively. To identify cis- and trans-acting factors of DMV formation, we established a trans cleavage assay. We found that induction of DMVs requires full-length NS3, whereas a helicase-lacking mutant was unable to trigger DMV formation in spite of efficient polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, a mutation accelerating cleavage kinetics at the NS4B-5A site diminished DMV formation, while the insertion of an internal ribosome entry site mimicking constitutive cleavage at this boundary completely abolished this process. These results identify key determinants governing the biogenesis of the HCV RF with possible implications for our understanding of how RFs are formed in other positive-strand RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2015-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romero-Brey, In\u00E9s; Berger, Carola; Kallis, Stephanie; Kolovou, Androniki; Paul, David; Lohmann, Volker; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17bfdf17f46ae63e52c3e7c085bac97057e9ae61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488949.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00759-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RF formation","site diminished DMV formation","trans-acting factors of DMV formation","HCV RF","constitutive cleavage","positive-strand RNA viruses","cleavage kinetics","disrupted RNA replication","virus assembly","Induction of membrane rearrangements","NS5A responsible","RNA-binding domain","induction of DMVs","trans cleavage assay","RFs","process","concerted action of nonstructural action of nonstructural protein","spite of efficient polyprotein cleavage","deletion of NS5A D2","sole expression of NS5A","hallmark of positive","amino-terminal membrane anchor","assembly of viral replication factories","key determinants","endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles","cytoplasm of infected cells","hepatitis C virus","internal ribosome entry site","infection","insertion","biogenesis","NS4B","D1","scaffolds","helicase-lacking mutant","possible implications","D3","full-length NS3","understanding","major constituent","boundary","results","contrast","mutation","efficiency","altered membranes","study"],"language":"en"},

ACE is well known to be a key part of the rennin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. The inhibitors of ACE have the potency of treating hypertension. This article reviews the structure-function relationship of ACE as well as its gene polymorphism and inhibitor development. In particular, it has been found that the catalytic mechanisms of the two active sites of somatic ACE in the cleavage of angiotensin I and bradykin are different. Therefore, by specifically targeting the individual active sites of somatic ACE, it will likely offer a new way to develop novel ACE inhibitors with fewer side effects.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yulan; Xu, Chuanlian","journal":"Chinese Journal of Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d3a67e49bdb16a0319860af08bed80c6e800c5e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1872207508600072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872207508600072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of ACE","novel ACE inhibitors","cleavage of angiotensin","decapeptide angiotensin","Abstract Angiotensin","individual active sites of somatic ACE","structure-function relationship of ACE","rennin-angiotensin system","potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin","conversion","gene polymorphism","new way","fewer","effects","enzyme","blood pressure","C-terminal amino acids","dependent dipeptidase","membrane","inhibitor development","article","catalytic mechanisms","bradykin","potency","hypertension"],"language":"en"},

Conventional detection strategies based on serological assays, biological indexing and RT-PCR targeting one or few viruses in each assay are widely used. Grapevines are prone to contain mixed infections of several viruses, making the use of these techniques time-consuming. A 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray able to detect simultaneously a broad spectrum of known viruses as well as new viruses by cross-hybridization to highly conserved probes is reported in the present study. The array contains 570 unique probes designed against highly conserved and species-specific regions of 44 plant viral genomes. In addition probes designed against plant housekeeping genes are also included. By using a random primed RT-PCR amplification strategy of grapevine double stranded RNA-enriched samples, viral agents were detected in single and mixed infections. The microarray accuracy to detect 10 grapevine viruses was compared with RT-PCR yielding consistent results. For this purpose, grapevine samples containing single or mixed infections of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -9, Grapevine fanleaf virus, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus, Grapevine virus A, and Grapevine virus B were used. Genomic libraries containing complete viral genomes were also used as part of the validation process. The specific probe hybridization pattern obtained from each virus makes this approach a powerful tool for high throughput plant certification purposes and also for virus discovery if the new viral genomic sequences have partial similarity with the microarray probes. Three Closteroviridae members (Grapevine leafroll-associated virus -4, -7 and -9) were detected for the first time in Chilean grapevines using the microarray.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Engel, Esteban A.; Escobar, Paula F.; Rojas, Luis A.; Rivera, Paulina A.; Fiore, Nicola; Valenzuela, Pablo D.T.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb31ba823f3f0b5c2d3d59167f83b5d0608ec1e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112925.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.11.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409004790; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409004790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19914293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["grapevine viruses","Grapevine fanleaf virus","Grapevine virus B","grapevine samples","mixed infections of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus","virus discovery","new viruses","microarray probes","Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus","plant viral genomes","conserved probes","viral agents","addition probes","unique probes","microarray accuracy","complete viral genomes","new viral genomic sequences","broad spectrum of known viruses","random primed RT-PCR amplification strategy of grapevine double stranded RNA-enriched samples","Chilean grapevines","mer oligonucleotide microarray able","plant housekeeping genes","Genomic libraries","cross-hybridization","high throughput plant certification purposes","specific probe hybridization pattern","powerful tool","serological assays","partial similarity","biological indexing","species-specific regions","approach","Conventional detection strategies","Closteroviridae members","consistent results","present study","techniques time-consuming","economic damage","validation process"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves. ANIMALS: Two hundred and eighty\u2010six calves \u003C21 days. Calves with liquid or semiliquid feces, temperature \u003E39.5\u00B0C, and inappetence were considered as cases, and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. METHODS: Prospective case\u2013control study. A specific BCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR assay was used to detect BCoV in fecal samples. Association between BCoV and health status was evaluated by exact and random effect logistic regression. Fecal (n = 28) and nasal (n = 8) samples from diarrheic calves were tested for the presence of BCoV by both the PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR and a specific BCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR assays. A Kappa coefficient test was used to assess the level of agreement of both assays. RESULTS: BCoV was detected in 55% (157/286) of calves; 46% (66/143), and 64% (91/143) of healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Diarrheic calves had higher odds of BCoV presence than healthy calves (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.83, P = 0.004).

Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Here we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormality. METHODS: We received 156 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 from two designated centers in China, and compared clinical features between patients with elevated aminotransferase or not. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from two cases who had elevated aminotransferase. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and pathological studies. RESULTS: 64 of 156 (41.0%) COVID-19 patients had elevated aminotransferase. The median levels of ALT were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, AST were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. The liver enzyme abnormality was associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher A-aDO2, higher GGT, lower albumin, decreased CD4\u002B T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles characterized by spike structure in cytoplasm of hepatocytes in two COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and a certain binuclear hepatocytes were observed. Taken together, both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection. Immunohistochemical results showed scanty CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B lymphocytes. No obvious eosinophil infiltration, cholestasis, fibrin deposition, granuloma, massive central necrosis, or interface hepatitis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver is a crucial cause of hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients. Hence, a surveillance of viral clearance in liver and long outcome of COVID-19 is required.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yijin; Liu, Shuhong; Liu, Hongyang; Li, Wei; Lin, Fang; Jiang, Lina; Li, Xi; Xu, Pengfei; Zhang, Lixin; Zhao, Lihua; Cao, Yun; Kang, Jiarui; Yang, Jianfa; Li, Ling; Liu, Xiaoyan; Li, Yan; Nie, Ruifang; Mu, Jinsong; Lu, Fengmin; Zhao, Shousong; Lu, Jiangyang; Zhao, Jingmin","journal":"J Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ad8d7b3558c32c83650c3d87034e53ff68d5291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211738.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827820302944; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437830/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827820302944?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","liver damage","Liver enzyme abnormality","liver pathological manifestations of COVID","patterns of liver impairment","Postmortem liver biopsies","elevated aminotransferase","long outcome of COVID","SARS-CoV","infected hepatocytes","cytoplasm of hepatocytes","typical lesion of viral infection","coronavirus disease","normal aminotransferase groups","cases","typical coronavirus particles","massive hepatic apoptosis","certain binuclear hepatocytes","decreased CD4","higher GGT","scanty CD4","crucial cause of hepatic impairment","clinical features","clinical characteristics","pathological studies","B lymphocytes","disease severity","Ultrastructural examination","Immunohistochemical results","massive central necrosis","surveillance of viral clearance","endoplasmic reticulum dilatation","fibrin deposition","lower albumin","conspicuous mitochondrial swelling","aDO2","electron microscopy","immunohistochemistry","T cells","cholestasis","TUNEL assay","granuloma","spike structure","obvious eosinophil infiltration","glycogen granule decrease","histological evidence","series of laboratory tests","China","interface hepatitis","CD8","BACKGROUND","designated centers","median levels of ALT","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) on EV71 replication and to explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS: To measure the activity of ATA in inhibiting the cytopathic effect (CPE) of EV71, a cell-based neutralization (inhibition of virus-induced CPE) assay was performed. The effect of ATA was further confirmed using plaque reduction and viral yield reduction assays. A time of addition assay was performed to identify the mechanisms of ATA\u0027s anti-EV71 activity. We examined the effects of ATA on the following key steps involved in virus replication: (i) translation of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated viral polyprotein; (ii) the proteolytic activity of viral proteases 2A and/or 3C; and (iii) the viral 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. RESULTS: In this study, ATA was found to be a potent inhibitor of the replication of EV71. In the antiviral neutralization assay, ATA exhibited inhibitory activity against EV71 (TW/4643/98) and EV71 (TW/2231/98). Plaque assay further demonstrated that ATA inhibited EV71 replication with an EC(50) (effective concentration at which 50% of plaques were removed) of 2.9 \u00B5M. Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that ATA targets the early stage of the viral life cycle after viral entry. ATA was able to inhibit the RdRp activity of EV71, while neither the IRES-mediated translation of viral polyprotein nor the viral 3C protease activity was affected. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings in this study suggest that ATA is able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through interfering with the viral 3D polymerase.","publish_time":"2010-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Hui-Chen; Chen, Tzu-Chun; Fang, Ming-Yu; Yen, Kuei-Jung; Shih, Shin-Ru; Hsu, John T.-A.; Tseng, Ching-Ping","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44290ff75bad8ffaf5d3028420739ce7b08dc2a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20089540/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkp502","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of ATA","replication of EV71","ATA inhibited EV71 replication","RdRp activity of EV71","effects of ATA","effect of ATA","viral entry","proteolytic activity of viral proteases","inhibitory activity","mechanisms of ATA\u0027s anti-EV71 activity","viral life cycle","virus replication","IRES-mediated translation of viral polyprotein","C protease activity","viral yield reduction assays","Plaque assay","study","antiviral neutralization assay","plaque reduction","D polymerase","time of addition assay","TW","D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","inhibition of virus","induced CPE","cytopathic effect","mechanism of action","underlying mechanism","cell-based neutralization","effects of aurintricarboxylic acid","internal ribosomal entry site","following key steps","early stage","interfering","serious diseases","potent inhibitor","Enterovirus","humans","findings","effective concentration","plaques","Studies","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","\u00B5M","CONCLUSIONS","aim","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients\u2019 oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)\u002B T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0\u201362.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients\u2019 inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0\u201311.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients\u2019 stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0\u201316.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0\u20134.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients\u2019 urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R(2) = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4\u002B T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients\u2019 stools (t = \u22122.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P \u003C 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P \u003E 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients\u2019 stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Yun; Xu, Shui-Bao; Lin, Yi-Xiao; Tian, Di; Zhu, Zhao-Qin; Dai, Fa-Hui; Wu, Fan; Song, Zhi-Gang; Huang, Wei; Chen, Jun; Hu, Bi-Jie; Wang, Sheng; Mao, En-Qiang; Zhu, Lei; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Lu, Hong-Zhou","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b1a79b1896bdbbe3e5ffc68e2a45ee57058deca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118639/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000774","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of viral RNA detection","delayed clearance of viral RNA","duration of RNA detection","positive fecal viral RNA test results","negative results","days","treatment of COVID","different specimens of patients","management of patients","viral nucleic acid clearance","non-glucocorticoid treatment group","oropharyngeal swabs","laboratory test results of convalescent patients","negative RT-PCR results","patients\u2019 stool specimens","non-febrile patients","hospital treatment","median duration","patients\u2019 urine specimens","longer duration","fecal samples","patients\u2019 inflammatory indicators","patients\u2019 oropharyngeal swab","different samples","urine samples","patients\u2019 stools","throat swabs","clearance time","serum samples","T lymphocytes","median time","median delay","median age","T lymphocyte count","onset of symptoms","CD4","novel coronavirus disease","nCoV","convalescence","study","different body fluids","respiratory symptoms","clinical data","confirmed cases","symptom onset","mild disease","improved clinical condition","h sampling interval","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","presence","secretions","factors","multiple linear regression model","differentiation","significant difference","feces","glucocorticoids","host cell immunity","patient\u0027s infectivity","excreta","METHODS","evidence","brief","persistence","effects of cluster","BACKGROUND","adjusted R","analysis","women","CONCLUSIONS","total","years"],"language":"en"},

We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers\u2019 case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03). In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults. There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03). Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Wenjun; Yu, Jinhong; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoguo; Zhang, Shouwei; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Zhongfa","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ba4b02b798ab765fb4973ad544c6a964cc18a03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161094.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01427-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic cases","radiological characteristics of children cases","conventional cases","clinical symptoms of children","consecutive hospitalized cases","clinical disease","adults","clinical manifestations","mild clinical signs","age of asymptomatic patients","laboratory","common symptoms","COVID","dry cough","lung injuries","substantial lung injury","research centers\u2019 case series","health workers","lymphocyte counts","phlegm","timely diagnosis","early stages","occurrence","pronounced inflammatory response","China","outbreak","lower level of CRP","bilateral involvement","neutrophils count","CONCLUSIONS","Rizhao","threat","treatment","METHODS","pattern","BACKGROUND","family clusters","RESULTS","Jinan","study","world","Fever"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. METHODS: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. FINDINGS: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P = 0\u00B7007, P \u003C 0\u00B7001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0\u00B7001, P \u003C 0\u00B7001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6\u20139 days after initial CT scans. INTERPRETATION: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Huanhuan; Liu, Fang; Li, Jinning; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Dengbin; Lan, Weishun","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f19a3337ec9031bc1c13b347a80c74658d7b384e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156118.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301183; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171865/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnant groups","non-pregnant adults group","Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women","clinical features of COVID","CT features","children","clinical symptoms","CT data","follow-up CT","laboratory confirmation","initial CT scans","patients","lesions","complete consolidation","Mixed consolidation","ongoing outbreak of COVID","cases","focal GGO","pulmonary involvement","initial identification","days","initial normal body temperature","severity assessment","timely therapeutic effects evaluation","early detection","modality of choice","screening","Pure ground-glass opacity","INTERPRETATION","exposure history","chest","BACKGROUND","pneumonia","difficulty","progression","METHODS","disease","predominant presence","elevated neutrophil ratio","bilateral distributions","reticulation","improvement","leukocytosis","lymphopenia"],"language":"en"},

In this essay we argue that GOF-type experiments have already produced important information not available from any other source while also providing information on pathogenesis and the requirements for optimizing strains for vaccine production. We analyze the moral arguments against GOF and find them less compelling for a variety of reasons ranging from the uncertainty of risk-benefit analysis to the reduced likelihood of accidents given the enhanced biosafety and biosecurity protocols currently in place. In our view the most important consequence of the GOF debate is that it brought renewed attention to biosafety protocols and ushered innovation in answering the relevant biological questions with greater safety. We conclude that GOF experiments should go forward provided that necessary biosafety and biosecurity conditions are in place.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imperiale, Michael J.; Howard, Don; Casadevall, Arturo","journal":"Influenza Virus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83215814219b9cd6f2f5a6e7bca32e5b7599c138.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120448.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GOF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GOF debate","GOF experiments","GOF-type experiments","biosafety protocols","enhanced biosafety","necessary biosafety","biosecurity protocols","important information","place","biosecurity conditions","important consequence","type of research","moral arguments","ushered innovation","reduced likelihood of accidents","renewed attention","relevant biological questions","mammalian transmissible","pathogenic avian influenza virus","benefit analysis","uncertainty of risk","requirements","strains","greater safety","pathogenesis","experimentation","source","function","variety of reasons","gain","vaccine production","decade","view","essay"],"language":"en"},

Our results showed that treatment with glycyrrhizin significantly reduced PRRSV proliferation and PRRSV-encoded protein expression in a dose-dependent manner.

Furthermore, we were able to exclude a direct inhibitory action of glycyrrhizin on PRRSV particles.

When free cysteines are found on the surface of proteins, they are often involved in catalytic residues, as in cysteine proteases, P-loop phosphatases, etc. Additionally, a unique property of cysteines is that their side-chain volume is different from all other amino acids. This study is focused on the discrimination between structural versus active free cysteines based on a local environment analysis which does not appear to have been attempted previously. We have demonstrated the corresponding structural positions associated with free cysteines in their three-dimensional localization environment. We examined protein samples including nine, sequenced, coronavirus proteases and cysteine-rich non-membrane proteins.

Some of these proteins trigger signals to kidnap cell organelles and factors which will form a new macro-structure, the virus factory, that acts as a physical scaffold for viral replication and assembly. We are only beginning to envisage the extraordinary complexity of these interactions, whose characterisation is a clear experimental challenge for which we now have powerful tools. Conventional study of infection kinetics using virology, biochemistry and cell biology methods can be followed by genome-scale screening and global proteomics. These are important new technologies with which we can identify the cell factors used by viruses at different stages in their life cycle. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and electron tomography, together with labelling methods for molecular mapping in situ, show immature viral intermediates, mature virions and recruited cell elements in their natural environment. This chapter describes how these methods are being used to understand the cell biology of viral morphogenesis and suggests what they might achieve in the near future.","publish_time":"2013-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Risco, Cristina; Fern\u00E1ndez de Castro, Isabel","journal":"Structure and Physics of Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bc01219f59c2fd45139b112a5405243d0e8a504.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121607.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell factors","cell biology methods","cell elements","cell organelles","cell biology of viral morphogenesis","viral replication","viral particles","electron microscopy","immature viral intermediates","labelling methods","Viruses","electron tomography","Light microscopy","new macro-structure","proteins trigger signals","important new technologies","virology","situ","mature virions","biochemistry","molecular mapping","different stages","characterisation","Conventional study of infection kinetics","genome-scale screening","virus factory","physical scaffold","interactions","global proteomics","assembly","clear experimental challenge","life cycle","natural environment","extraordinary complexity","activities","cells","powerful tools","near future","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Solar cycles and related changes in the geomagnetic field, variations in water temperature and weather conditions, coast geographical features and human activities have been proposed as possible causes. In December 2009, a pod of seven male sperm whales stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the sixth instance from 1555 in this basin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Complete necropsies were performed on three whales whose bodies were in good condition, carrying out on sampled tissues histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, and screening of veins looking for gas emboli. Furthermore, samples for age determination, genetic studies, gastric content evaluation, stable isotopes and toxicology were taken from all the seven specimens. The animals were part of the same group and determined by genetic and photo-identification to be part of the Mediterranean population. Causes of death did not include biological agents, or the \u201Cgas and fat embolic syndrome\u201D, associated with direct sonar exposure. Environmental pollutant tissue concentrations were relatively high, in particular organochlorinated xenobiotics. Gastric content and morphologic tissue examinations showed a prolonged starvation, which likely caused, at its turn, the mobilization of lipophilic contaminants from the adipose tissue. Chemical compounds subsequently entered the blood circulation and may have impaired immune and nervous functions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A multi-factorial cause underlying this sperm whales\u0027 mass stranding is proposed herein based upon the results of postmortem investigations as well as of the detailed analyses of the geographical and historical background. The seven sperm whales took the same \u201Cwrong way\u201D into the Adriatic Sea, a potentially dangerous trap for Mediterranean sperm whales. Seismic surveys should be also regarded as potential co-factors, even if no evidence of direct impact has been detected.","publish_time":"2011-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzariol, Sandro; Di Guardo, Giovanni; Petrella, Antonio; Marsili, Letizia; Fossi, Cristina M.; Leonzio, Claudio; Zizzo, Nicola; Vizzini, Salvatrice; Gaspari, Stefania; Pavan, Gianni; Podest\u00E0, Michela; Garibaldi, Fulvio; Ferrante, Margherita; Copat, Chiara; Traversa, Donato; Marcer, Federica; Airoldi, Sabina; Frantzis, Alexandros; De Bernaldo Quir\u00F3s, Yara; Cozzi, Bruno; Fern\u00E1ndez, Antonio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c59d82d87d20a5a5ab05c5c19895bda141167d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3097202.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21673789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mediterranean","Mediterranean Sea","Adriatic Sea"],"keyphrases":["Mediterranean sperm whales","male sperm whales","Mass strandings of sperm whales","Mediterranean Sea","sperm whales\u0027 mass stranding","adipose tissue","Adriatic Sea","Mediterranean population","gastric content evaluation","coast geographical features","morphologic tissue examinations","genetic studies","Adriatic coast of Southern Italy","Environmental pollutant tissue concentrations","gas emboli","historical background","possible causes","evidence of direct impact","direct sonar exposure","water temperature","weather conditions","variations","multi-factorial cause","geomagnetic field","bacteriology","human activities","Physeter macrocephalus","dangerous trap","related changes","stable isotopes","age determination","sampled tissues histopathology","blood circulation","parasitology","virology","Complete necropsies","mobilization of lipophilic contaminants","screening of veins","good condition","wrong way","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","SIGNIFICANCE","samples","toxicology","detailed analyses","prolonged starvation","fat embolic syndrome","Solar cycles","particular organochlorinated xenobiotics","potential co-factors","Chemical compounds","nervous functions","turn","CONCLUSIONS","biological agents","group","photo-identification","bodies","pod","unexplained events","results of postmortem investigations","death","Seismic surveys","instance","basin","animals","specimens"],"language":"en"},

The inhibitory activity against other FCV isolates from China was also identified. More importantly, we found that IOP exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against the feline herpesvirus 1, feline influenza virus H3N2 and H5N6, feline panleukopenia virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus that can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in cats.

Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%).

They are compared with their arterivirus cousins, which also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13\u201316kb). Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined. These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes. Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase. Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases. A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3\u2032-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts. The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses. The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.","publish_time":"2006-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Enjuanes, Luis; Ziebuhr, John; Snijder, Eric J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114179.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170206000360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170206000360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large nidoviruses","set of RNA","mechanisms of RNA","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","large genomes","evolution of nidoviruses","largest known RNA genomes","polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity","low fidelity of RNA replication","replicase machinery","monophyletic group of animal RNA viruses","virus particles","virus adaptation","virus-specific accessory genes","genome diversity","genome expansion","smaller genome","order Nidovirales","review","diverse accessory proteins","Replicase gene expression","protein synthesis","specific hosts","ancestors of small","processing enzymes","unique features","conserved structural proteins","nested set of subgenomic RNAs","principal control","composition","ribosomal frameshifting signal","roniviruses","origin","nidovirus genetic plan","chymotrypsin","related coronaviruses","rise","replicative complex","helicase","proximal ORFs","toroviruses","subunits","arterivirus cousins","papain","proteases","acquisition"],"language":"en"},

Other viral etiologies of FVH are rarer. FVH is life-threatening, but the patients are typically otherwise healthy, and normally resistant to other microbes. Only a small minority of infected individuals develop FVH, and this is the key issue to be addressed for this disease. In mice, mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection is the main model for dissecting FVH pathogenesis. Susceptibility to MHV3 differs between genetic backgrounds, with high and low mortality in C57BL6 and A/J mice, respectively. FVH pathogenesis in mice is related to uncontrolled inflammation and fibrinogen deposition. In humans, FVH is typically sporadic, but rare familial forms also exist, suggesting that there may be causal monogenic inborn errors. A recent study reported a single-gene inborn error of human immunity underlying FVH. A patient with autosomal recessive complete IL-18BP deficiency was shown to have FVH following HAV infection. The mechanism probably involves enhanced IL-18- and IFN-\u03B3-dependent killing of hepatocytes by NK and CD8 T cytotoxic cells. Proof-of-principle that FVH can be genetic is important clinically, for the affected patients and their families, and immunologically, for the study of immunity to viruses in the liver. Moreover, the FVH-causing IL18BP genotype suggests that excessive IL-18 immunity may be a general mechanism underlying FVH, perhaps through the enhancement of IFN-\u03B3 immunity.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jouanguy, Emmanuelle","journal":"Hum Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a96d3269dbea1b2507140a7bbb539a5547310e92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285199/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-020-02166-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FVH","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dissecting FVH pathogenesis","viral etiologies of FVH","\u03B3 immunity","study of immunity","hepatitis B virus","mouse hepatitis virus","fulminant viral hepatitis","MHV3","excessive IL","enhanced IL","HAV infection","IFN-\u03B3","J mice","single-gene inborn error of human immunity","autosomal recessive complete IL","genetic backgrounds","enhancement of IFN","rare cases","affected patients","recent study","general mechanism","rare familial forms","causal monogenic inborn errors","NK","dependent killing of hepatocytes","main model","HBV","BP deficiency","CD8 T cytotoxic cells","low mortality","C57BL6","massive hepatocyte necrosis","uncontrolled inflammation","inflammatory infiltrate","small minority of infected individuals","IL18BP genotype","fibrinogen deposition","Susceptibility","viruses","principle","families","key issue","liver","Proof","humans","microbes","disease"],"language":"en"},

In addition, this approach has also helped in establishing the associations of viromes with many diseases. However, unlike the metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA for the detection of bacteria, it is impossible to create universal oligonucleotides to target all known and novel viruses, owing to their genomic diversity and variability. On the other hand, sequencing the entire genome is still expensive and has relatively low sensitivity for such applications. The existing approaches for the design of oligonucleotides for targeted enrichment are usually involved in the development of primers for the PCR-based detection of particular viral species or genera, but not for families or higher taxonomic orders. In this study, we have developed a computational pipeline for designing the oligonucleotides capable of covering a significant number of known viruses within various taxonomic orders, as well as their novel variants. We have subsequently designed a genus-specific oligonucleotide panel for targeted enrichment of viral nucleic acids in biological material and demonstrated the possibility of its application for virus detection in bird samples. We have tested our panel using a number of collected samples and have observed superior efficiency in the detection and identification of viral pathogens. Since a reliable, bioinformatics-based analytical method for the rapid identification of the sequences was crucial, an NGS-based data analysis module was developed in this study, and its functionality in the detection of novel viruses and analysis of virome diversity was demonstrated.","publish_time":"2018-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayginin, Andrey A.; Pimkina, Ekaterina V.; Matsvay, Alina D.; Speranskaya, Anna S.; Safonova, Marina V.; Blinova, Ekaterina A.; Artyushin, Ilya V.; Dedkov, Vladimir G.; Shipulin, German A.; Khafizov, Kamil","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddddc52ff6183d8092a992286fd64acb18cdf2bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6109506.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158979/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3248285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of novel viruses","virus detection","detection of bacteria","identification of viral pathogens","PCR-based detection of particular viral species","various biological samples","new viral pathogens","significant number of known viruses","targeted enrichment of viral nucleic acids","spectrum of viruses prevalent","oligonucleotides capable","design of oligonucleotides","various taxonomic orders","universal oligonucleotides","bird samples","novel variants","study","NGS-based data analysis module","analysis of virome diversity","higher taxonomic orders","biological material","rapid identification","genomic diversity","generation sequencing","genus-specific oligonucleotide panel","analytical method","S rRNA","possibility","technologies","families","sequences","superior efficiency","functionality","computational pipeline","development of primers","entire genome","low sensitivity","bioinformatics","metagenomic studies","existing approaches","associations of viromes","diseases","applications","hand","Advances","variability","addition"],"language":"en"},

Infection of HeLa cells with poliovirus causes hnRNP C to relocalize from the nucleus, where it is normally retained during interphase, to the cytoplasm. We have proposed that in the cytoplasm, the protein isoforms of hnRNP C participate in the recognition of viral specific RNAs by the poliovirus replication proteins and/or in the assembly of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes. In SK-OV-3 cells, which express reduced levels of hnRNP C compared to HeLa cells or 293 cells, the kinetics of poliovirus replication are delayed. hnRNP C is also re-localized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SK-OV-3 cells infected with poliovirus. Increased expression of hnRNP C in SK-OV-3 cells by transient transfection increases the rate of virus production and overall yield over that seen in mock-transfected cells.

Integrated global approaches to improve the health of humans, animals and their shared environments are proving to be in the best interest of many countries.

Indeed, current virus classification is increasingly performed using ever more complex phylogenetic approaches that move researchers closer to a rudimentary understanding of the origin, evolution, relatedness, and diversification of viruses over eons.","publish_time":"2020-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuhn, Jens H.","journal":"Reference Module in Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efb46b27c6a89c6b95641816414da41f172f33fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157452.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338212314; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096338212314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus taxonomy","classification of viruses","current virus classification","taxa","diversification of viruses","number of new viruses","niche subspecialty","significant subspecialty of systematic evolutionary biology","viral genome sequence space","researchers closer","expanded known global virome","rudimentary understanding","development","implementation","biophysical characteristics of virions","origin","complex phylogenetic approaches","standardized nomenclature","relatedness","phenotype","categories","subjective process","generation sequencing methods","field","decades","importance","eons"],"language":"en"},

More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreak. Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahimi, Farid; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi","journal":"Arch Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff8e62b3d4885edefc5e2eaeaef96b7296412a13.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920305257; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920305257?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381375/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probable pandemic of COVID","future COVID","forthcoming COVID","numbers of infected cases","uniform global response","subsequent fast dispersion","suite of global intervention measures","heightened concerns","prevention","immediate quarantine","antiviral drugs","vaccines","genetic evolution","markets","stockpiling","expediting projects","questions","pathogenesis","world","outbreaks","transmission routes","public health","demands scrutinization","initial breakout","rules of customs","SARS-CoV","export","smuggling","borders","China","short period of time","large number of protective facemasks","involved regions","main actions","live-animal trade","regulations","welfare","presumption","epidemic","Wuhan","Abstract","lessons","different countries"],"language":"en"},

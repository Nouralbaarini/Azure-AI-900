The current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has already resulted in high numbers of critically ill patients and deaths in the non-pregnant population, mainly due to respiratory failure. During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract. The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management. In addition to routine measurements of D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID19 as per ISTH guidance, monitoring of APTT and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report. These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vlachodimitropoulou Koumoutsea, Evangelia; Vivanti, Alexandre J; Shehata, Nadine; Benachi, Alexandra; Le Gouez, Agnes; Desconclois, Celine; Whittle, Wendy; Snelgrove, John; Malinowski, Kinga Ann","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal COVID19 infection","COVID19 relationship","severe COVID19 infection","maternal stabilization","pregnancy","SARS-CoV","rapid maternal deterioration","positive pregnant women","ill patients","increased risk","respiratory tract","respiratory failure","increased oxygen consumption","non-pregnant population","peripartum period","physiological adaptive alterations","early organ dysfunction","dimers","immune function","deaths","changes","prothrombin time","routine measurements of D","consideration of delivery","appropriate diagnosis","knowledge","platelet count","edema","pre-emptive admission","reminiscent of HELLP syndrome","APTT","coagulopathy","ISTH guidance","putative link","laboratory derangements","fibrinogen levels","high numbers","addition","management","current pandemic","viral outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received US FDA EUA on March 12, 2020. The comparator was a standardized 3-hour SARS-CoV-2 protocol, consisting of RNA extraction using an automated portable instrument, followed by a two-target RT-PCR, which our laboratory has routinely used since January 2020 (Corman VM et al. EuroSurveill 25 (3):2000045). Cobas and the comparator showed overall agreement of 98.1% and a kappa value of 0.95 on an in-house validation panel consisting of 217 well-characterized retrospective samples. Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall percent agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98. A good correlation (r 2 = 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2 specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed. Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the UTM-RT system. Under the extraordinary circumstances that laboratories are facing worldwide, a safe diagnostic platform switch is feasible in only 48 hours and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic if carefully planned and executed.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poljak, Mario; Korva, Mi\u0161a; Knap Ga\u0161per, Nata\u0161a; Fujs Komlo\u0161, Kristina; Sagadin, Martin; Ur\u0161i\u010D, Tina; Av\u0161i\u010D \u017Dupanc, Tatjana; Petrovec, Miroslav","journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00599-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration","FDA","Roche Molecular Systems","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hour SARS-CoV","commercial SARS-CoV","comparator","qualitative detection of SARS","timely diagnosis of SARS","target test cobas","diagnostic instruments","diagnostic approaches","diagnostic needs","manufacturer-independent evaluation data","US FDA EUA","overall agreement","pandemic","Laboratories","kappa value","safe diagnostic platform switch","nasopharyngeal swab samples","overall percent agreement","target RT-PCR","well-characterized retrospective samples","US Food","extraordinary demand","automated sample","extraordinary circumstances","Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation","automated portable instrument","UTM-RT system","reagents","NJ","tests Emergency Use Authorization","reliable assay","RNA extraction","in-house validation panel","sampling devices","consumables","Roche Molecular Systems","protocol","specific targets","cycle threshold values","Branchburg","Drug Administration","hours","midst","Corman VM","EuroSurveill","good correlation","COVID","laboratory","results","infection"],"language":"en"},

But the reliability, reproducibility, and selectivity of majority of such diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread. In this regard, a selective \u0027naked-eye\u0027 detection of SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable, which can be tested without accessing any advanced instrumental techniques. We herein report the development of a colorimetric assay based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), those when capped with suitably designed thiol modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 minutes from the isolated RNA samples. The thiol modified ASO capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/\u00B5L of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Thus, the current study reports a selective, and visual \u0027naked-eye\u0027 detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moitra, Parikshit; Alafeef, Maha; Dighe, Ketan; Frieman, Matt; Pan, Dipanjan","journal":"ACS nano","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CoV viral RNA","detection of SARS","RNA strand","\u00B5L of RNA","target RNA sequence of SARS","detection of COVID","viral gene","viral load","RNA-DNA hybrid","isolated RNA samples","current spread","limit of detection","naked-eye","positive COVID","current outbreak","current study","ASO capped AuNPs agglomerate","sophisticated instrumental techniques","advanced instrumental techniques","N-gene","presence of MERS","designed thiol","colorimetric assay","selectivity of majority","pandemic coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","ASOs","antisense oligonucleotides","nucleocapsid phosphoprotein","minutes","early representation","causative virus","solution","surface plasmon resonance","large-scale diagnosis","cases","change","gold nanoparticles","requirement","detectable precipitate","reproducibility","diagnostic tests","additional agglomeration","addition of RNaseH","reliability","development","regard","communities"],"language":"en"},

We analyze the effect of diversity on coverage and downstream event detection using simulated data.

In addition, seven data complexity measures are considered for the initial purpose of investigating the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of resampling techniques.

Several variants of the problem have been considered, depending on the fact that the match is exact or approximate and, in this latter case, which edit operations are considered and where are allowed. In this paper we present results on the complexity of the approximate matching problem, where edit operations are symbol substitutions and are allowed only on the graph labels or both on the graph labels and the query string. We introduce a variant of the problem that asks whether there exists a path in a graph that represents a query string with any number of edit operations and we show that is NP-complete, even when labels have length one and in the case the alphabet is binary. Moreover, when it is parameterized by the length of the input string and graph labels have length one, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable and it is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel. The NP-completeness of this problem leads to the inapproximability (within any factor) of the approximate matching when edit operations are allowed only on the graph labels. Moreover, we show that the variants of approximate string matching to graph we consider are not fixed-parameter tractable, when the parameter is the number of edit operations, even for graphs that have distance one from a DAG. The reduction for this latter result allows us to prove the inapproximability of the variant where edit operations can be applied both on the query string and on graph labels.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dondi, Riccardo; Mauri, Giancarlo; Zoppis, Italo","journal":"Language and Automata Theory and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e11d3c75c6aee05701b6efc9551edc25d800e732.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graph labels","operations","query string","approximate matching problem","directed graph","variants of approximate string matching","input string","length","parameter tractable","inapproximability","case","number","NP-completeness","complexity","data mining","different fields","strings","application","computational biology","present results","paper","vertices","factor","symbol substitutions","distance","polynomial kernel","alphabet","graphs","DAG","reduction","path"],"language":"en"},

Bone tissue engineering based on engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with appropriate architecture and osteoconductive activity, alone or functionalized with bioactive factors, have been developed to enhance bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. In this review, we elaborate on the ideal properties of 3D scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis, including biocompatibility, degradability, porosity, and mechanical performance.

Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

Firstly, oil and gas drilling becomes much easier than before. Therefore, it may raise the level of discussions on disputed shelf zones where the deposits are located, especially near to Norway-Russia sea border. Secondly, oil and gas excavation leads to potential threats to fishing by changing natural habitats, which in turn can create serious damage to the economies. We construct a model, which helps to highlight potential disputed territories and analyze preferences of the countries interested in fossil fuels and fish resources. We also compare different scenarios of resource allocation with allocation by current agreement.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demin, Sergey; Shvydun, Sergey","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9197a36b8708c94f84a12d5864e41e8bea12f60e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Barents Sea"],"keyphrases":["oil","potential disputed territories","Barents Sea leads","potential threats","gas excavation","gas drilling","disputed shelf zones","different scenarios of resource allocation","Norway-Russia sea border","countries","situation","preferences","fossil fuels","turn","level of discussions","important consequences","current agreement","global warming","fish resources","natural habitats","serious damage","deposits","economies","result","model"],"language":"en"},

To identify Nash stability in MOGMs, a comprehensive preference matrix with weight parameters on objectives is developed for each DM, along with a unilateral move matrix including preference weights (UMP). Then, considering the subjective uncertainty of DMs, interval numbers are used to represent the degree of uncertainty of preference. Subsequently, Nash equilibria and interval Nash equilibria are developed for MOGMs, and the dependence of these equilibria on weights is shown. To illustrate how MOGM can be applied in practice and provide valuable strategic insights, it is used to investigate a US-China trade dispute model. The stability results suggest potential strategic resolutions of bilateral trade disputes, and how DMs can attain them. The case analysis process suggests that a peaceful settlement of the dispute may be achievable.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Jingjing; Kilgour, D.

Such observation has made many people believe that the low-income countries may be more immune to COVID-19. Theories such as warm climate, weaker strain of the virus, and cross-protection by malaria have been popularly put forward. One such interesting theory is that since the general people of the low- income countries are mostly habituated to dwell in lesser hygienic condition and with lesser medical attention throughout their lifetime; hence, they have naturally acquired better immunity and more resilience against many infective diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sought to investigate the above claim by comparing the case fatality rate (CFR) as well as number of cases per million population versus the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity per capita of different countries. RESULTS: We found that while the number of cases showed a slight decline in the lower-income countries, the CFR was independent of the financial condition of the country. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the theory of better immunity in economically poor countries is a misconception. We suggest that people must come out of these misconceptions and resort to strict home isolation.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Soumya","journal":"Indian J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da49c095dad6a58cfb694ca5cb9385488d187733.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","USA","CFR"],"locations":["India","Africa"],"keyphrases":["poor countries","different countries","low-income countries","lower-income countries","low- income countries","number of cases","CFR","general people","theory of better immunity","COVID","lesser hygienic condition","financial condition","interesting theory","lesser medical attention","purchasing power parity","gross domestic product","slight decline","virus","weaker strain","UK","misconceptions","Italy","population","warm climate","resort","strict home isolation","USA","France","case fatality rate","resilience","great force","Spain","pandemic","India","cross-protection","parts of Africa","claim","Theories","lifetime","infective diseases","malaria","OBJECTIVE","country","MATERIALS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","observation","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In addition to fostering network connectivity and cohesion, cut-points are characterized by other differential features compared to other authors, including a much higher level of productivity and greater participation in leadership positions, higher betweenness values, lower clustering coefficients and higher levels of constraint. The cut-points identified have different characteristics in terms of the connectivity they facilitate between research communities: some cut-points have established weak intercommunity ties in the form of bridges with a single author from a different community; in other cases, they serve as gatekeepers due to their connection with different authors of a community that they link with their own; cut-points may also act as structural folds, that is, actors with an overlapping role between two cohesive communities.

We compared the duodenal tube test (DTT) with hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HS) for their efficiency in detecting bile secretion. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 47 infants who underwent both DTT and HS to diagnose or exclude BA between January 2000 and March 2018. RESULTS BA was diagnosed in 32 of the 47 patients, and 7 of the remaining 15 non-BA patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography. Among the various DTT parameters, the total bile acid in duodenal fluid (DF-TBA)/serum (S) gamma-glutamyl transferase (\u03B3GTP) ratio was found to be the most specific for BA, with sensitivity and specificity of 98.0-100%, respectively. One BA patient in whom cut off values were not met was a premature infant. The sensitivity and specificity of HS were 100-56.3%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the DF-TBA/S-\u03B3GTP parameter was higher than that of HS (98.6% vs. 85.1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The DTT could be more a specific method than HS to detect bile excretion. Thus, the DTT should be incorporated into the multidisciplinary diagnostic approach for the differential diagnosis of BA to prevent unnecessary intraoperative cholangiography in patients who do not have BA.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshii, Daiki; Inomata, Yukihiro; Yamamoto, Hirotoshi; Irie, Tomoaki; Kadohisa, Masashi; Okumura, Kenji; Isono, Kaori; Honda, Masaki; Hayashida, Shintaro; Oya, Yuki; Hibi, Taizo","journal":"Surgery today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02010-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BA","DF-TBA/S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RESULTS BA","non-BA patients","specificity of HS","differential diagnosis of BA","bile secretion","various DTT parameters","total bile acid","DF-TBA","PURPOSE Confirmation of bile excretion","sensitivity","S-\u03B3GTP parameter","unnecessary intraoperative cholangiography","duodenal fluid","specific method","diagnostic accuracy","duodenal tube test","multidisciplinary diagnostic approach","gastrointestinal tract","gamma-glutamyl transferase","serum","hepatobiliary scintigraphy","biliary atresia","retrospective study","efficiency","infants","METHODS","subjects","ratio","values","premature infant","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 24\u00D724 LYSO crystals read out by 8 \u00D7 8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array, however peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poladyan, Harutyun; Bubon, Oleksandr; Teymurazyan, Aram; Senchurov, Sergii; Reznik, Alla","journal":"Physics in medicine and biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab9357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Position Weighted Center of Gravity","Truncated Center of Gravity"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Truncated Center of Gravity","crystal pixels","crystal array","modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique","PET detectors","multiplexed readout","gamma ray detectors","PW-CoG algorithm","calculation of gamma ray interaction position","crystal resolvability metrics","events","multiplexed photosensor readout","Readout signal multiplexing","periphery","edge crystals","used method","non-linear response","PET systems","reconstructed coordinates","proposed method","segmented scintillators","segmented photosensors","scintillation coordinates","edge effect","column multiplexing","LYSO crystals","SiPM array","formation of erroneous lines of response","degradation of spatial resolution","TCoG","result","valley ratios","electronics cost","reduction of image contrast","abovementioned limitations","coordinate reconstruction methods","row","pile-up","simplicity","incorrect assignment","lack of weights","ease of implementation","algorithms","peaks","drawback"],"language":"en"},

We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between different age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children as a result of reopening schools is, on its own, unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases. However, if this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour, for example increased contact rates among parents, it could have a much bigger effect. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the inequity and the greater the degree of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that M[a]ori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, A.; Plank, M.

Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761). Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued \u0027immunity certificates\u0027 if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Using a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy. Findings: We show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months. Interpretation: This study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klement, Eyal; Klement, Alon; Chinitz, David; Harel, Alon; Fattal, Eyal; Klausner, Ziv","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.12.20062687v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["low mortality","CA strategy","low-risk population","entire population","CA program","population subject","mitigation measures","development of herd immunity","overall mortality","uncontrolled scenarios","immunity certificates\u0027","lower mortality rates","public health implications","current alternatives","alternative approach","controlled avalanche","serious health conditions","minimal economic damage","severe economic repercussions","radical suppression measures","lower demand","critical health-care resources","acceptable practice","uncontrolled spread","controlled supervision","probability","rest","order","need","ski resorts","countries","individuals","maximum number of people","small avalanches","comorbidities","ongoing Covid","developed SARS-CoV","antibodies","pandemic","ICUs","study","compartmental model","main goal","years old","Background","effective vaccine","Methods","virus","release","months","Israel","time","option","Interpretation","Findings"],"language":"en"},

When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0=2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine.

Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score \u003E 1 and IC50 value \u003C 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct. Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor.

We recently described the Kuwait Progression Indicator based on laboratory findings, in an initial training cohort derived from the first series of 1096 consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait. The aim of this study was to validate the KPI scoring system in an independent cohort of patients with COVID19. Methodology: Data was collected prospectively for consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait between 24th February till 28th April 2020. Patients were grouped according to the severity of their clinical course as their main outcome, based on clinical and radiological parameters, with ICU admission and death as secondary outcomes. Model discrimination was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) while model calibration was assessed through a calibration plot and measures of slope and calibration in the large (CITL). Results: Of 752 patients not used in model development previously, 414 met the criteria for inclusion in this validation study. The baseline characteristics for these 752 patients were similar to the patients that were included in our validation cohort. The area under the curve was equal to 0.904 (95% CI, between 0.867 to 0.942), indicating good model discrimination. The calibration plot and CITL confirmed reasonably good model calibration.

Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C\u003ET)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis.

This study aimed to investigate the awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 among Bangladeshi medical doctors. Method: This cross sectional, web-based study was conducted with the help of an online questionnaire and sent to the doctors which comprised of a series of questions regarding demographics of the participants, symptoms and incubation period of COVID-19, mode of transmission, measures to prevent transmission, availability of training and personal protective equipment in Bangladeshi hospitals, and attitude of doctors towards the treatment of suspected patients with COVID-19. Results: Of 800 medical doctors, a total 545 completed the survey (response 68.13%). Among the participants, 52.3% were females, 72.8% were below 30 years of age, and majority (52.8%) were working outside the cities in the villages and rural areas. A total of 404 (74.1%) doctors reported the correct incubation period of COVID-19. Majority doctors were aware of the symptoms with mode of transmission of COVID-19, measures to prevent hospital transmission, along with ways of identifying suspected patients with COVID-19. However, more than 90% of the doctors reported of inadequate intensive care unit and ventilator facilities along with extreme scarcity of personal protective equipment in the hospitals. 65.7% doctors prefer avoid working with a COVID-19 patient and more than 50% doctors have expressed that they would send the suspected COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals without providing treatment. Conclusion: The health authorities should take appropriate training measures to increase the awareness of the medical doctors along with providing sufficient amount of personal protective equipment for the medical doctors and supporting staff before deploying them in hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mumu, S.

The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene, a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical, and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a full-length cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy. These studies define a unique prothrombinase gene (HFGL2) and implicate its importance in the pathogenesis of fulminant viral hepatitis.","publish_time":"2000-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levy, Gary A.; Liu, Mingfeng; Ding, Jinwen; Yuwaraj, Shankary; Leibowitz, Julian; Marsden, Philip A.; Ning, Qin; Kovalinka, Ana; Phillips, M.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. Results: 15 international publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. Conclusions: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"radulesco, t.; Lechien, J.

In order to improve the robustness of the radar-based gesture recognition system, the proposed framework extracts a comprehensive hand profile, including range, Doppler, azimuth and elevation, over multiple measurement-cycles and encodes them into a feature cube. Rather than feeding the range-Doppler spectrum sequence into a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected with recurrent neural networks, the proposed framework takes the aforementioned feature cube as input of a shallow CNN for gesture recognition to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a hand activity detection (HAD) algorithm to automatize the detection of gestures in real-time case. The proposed HAD can capture the time-stamp at which a gesture finishes and feeds the hand profile of all the relevant measurement-cycles before this time-stamp into the CNN with low latency. Since the proposed framework is able to detect and classify gestures at limited computational cost, it could be deployed in an edge-computing platform for real-time applications, whose performance is notedly inferior to a state-of-the-art personal computer.

Overall, our SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross-reactivity or false-positive result in non-COVID-19 samples. Further evaluation on larger and multi-centric cohorts is currently underway to establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at point-of-care settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butt, Azeem Mehmood; Siddique, Shafiqa; An, Xiaoping; Tong, Yigang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/478b438a3d890c8a224321781dee4b46e21b9ca1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20056986","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","qualitative detection of SARS","RT-LAMP protocols","dual gene RT-LAMP assay","detection capability","detection protocol","positive cases","Viral RNA","non-COVID","viral genes","false-positive result","associated coronavirus disease","nasopharyngeal swab samples","development of rapid testing protocols","isothermal amplification","need","methodology","clinical practice","subsequent implementation","diagnostic accuracy","point","multi-centric cohorts","reverse transcription loop","cross-reactivity","PCR","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","evaluation","total","global pathogen","ORF1a","aim of present study","minimal resources","timeframe","care settings","purpose","order"],"language":"en"},

We intend to explore the place of lung ultrasound (LU) imagery to assess lung status in those latter patients, with afterthoughts on the interest of it for quick triage of patients. Methods: eChoVid is a multicentric observational study based on routinely collected data, conducted in 3 emergency units of Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris. 107 SDC patients included between 19.03.2020 and 01.04.2020 had both a LU examination (LU) and a chest CT-scanner (CCS). LU consisted in scoring lesions of 8 chest zones, each scored from 0 to 3, defining a severity Global Score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CCS severity score was graded from 0 to 3, according to interstitial pneumonia signs extension. 14 patients had a LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician (NTP). Findings: GS shows good performances to predict CCS severity assessment of Covid19 disease categorized as Normal vs Pathologic, AUC-ROC=0.93, maximal Youden index for GS=1, with 95% sensitivity, 83% specificity. Similar performances were found for CCS categorization Normal or Minimal vs Moderate or Severe, N=90, AUC-ROC= 0.89, maximal Youden index for GS=7, with 86% sensitivity, 78% specificity. Multi-logistic regression model provided a weighted score, relating ultrasound scoring of each chest zone and CT-scanner severity score, with no significant improvement of GS. Good agreement was found between GS assessed by NTP and experts, measured by Bland \u0026 Altman method. Interpretation : GS score brings a simple tool to assess lung damages severity in SDC patients. Compared performance results between NTP and expert physician are very preliminary but opens a path towards adoption beyond the scope of ultrasound experts. LU is a good candidate for triage of SDC patients, especially useful when CT-scanners suffer from availability issues related either to overwhelmed requests or poor health infrastructure.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benchoufi, M.; Bokobza, J.; Anthony Chauvin, A.; Dion, E.; Baranne, M.-L.; Levan, F.; Gautier, M.; Cantin, D.; d Humieres, T.; Gil-Jardine, C.; Benenati, S.; Oberlin, M.; Martinez, M.; Kahn, N.; Vicaut, E.; Bourrier, P.; Diallo, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5159200e64800fb96a96c0427e0e9105d1cfcd3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20069633v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LU"],"organizations":["Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris","SDC","CCS","GS","NTP","Bland \u0026 Altman"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GS score","CCS severity score","triage of SDC patients","CT-scanner severity score","patients management","chest CT-scanner","severity Global Score","quick triage of patients","LU examination","lung damages severity","CCS severity assessment of Covid19 disease","chest X-ray","weighted score","chest zones","signs of clinical severity","significant improvement of GS","NTP","CCS categorization Normal","CT-scanners","good performances","place of lung ultrasound","AUC-ROC","lung status","good candidate","maximal Youden index","expert physician","scope of ultrasound experts","Good agreement","sensitivity","specificity","Normal vs Pathologic","Similar performances","trained physician","scoring lesions","Minimal vs Moderate","interstitial pneumonia signs extension","simple tool","requests","Hopitaux","emergency units of Assistance Publique","adoption","reference","learned societies of radiology emitted guidelines","imagery","Multi-logistic regression model","multicentric observational study","eChoVid","data","pulmonary injury","availability issues","Bland","performance results","poor health infrastructure","Methods","Background","Paris","Interpretation","Findings","Altman method","afterthoughts"],"language":"en"},

We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies. For each condition, we used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the proportional change in number of encounters during the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared with earlier in the same year (January-February 2020), using equivalent periods in 2019 as a control. After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P\u003C0.001) (Table). In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic. Our findings suggest an urgent need for public health messaging to ensure that patients continue to seek care for acute emergencies. In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kazi, D.

Many clinical diagnostic laboratories rely on commercial platforms that provide integrated end-to-end solutions. While this provides established robust pipelines, there is a clear bottleneck in the supply of reagents given the current situation of extraordinary high demand. Some laboratories resort to implementing kit-free handling procedures, but many other small laboratories will not have the capacity to develop those and/or will perform manual handling of their samples. In order to provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection we compared several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), the recently developed RNAdvance Blood (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared different 1-step RT-qPCR Master Mix brands: TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna\u00AE Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB). We used the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommended primers that detect two regions of the viral N gene as well as those that detect the RdRP gene region as per Public Health England (PHE) guidelines (Charite/WHO/PHE). Our data show that the RNA extraction methods provide similar results. Amongst the qPCR reagents tested, TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix and Luna\u00AE Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit proved most sensitive. The N1 and N2 primer-probes provide a more reliable detection than the RdRP-SARSr primer-probe set, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we have implemented a protocol using heat inactivation and demonstrate that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples - potentially making SARS-CoV-2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL-3 facilities.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lista, Maria Jose; Page, Robert; Sertkaya, Helin; Matos, Pedro; Ortiz-Zapater, Elena; Maguire, Thomas J.A.; Poulton, Kate; O\u0027Byrne, Aoife; Bouton, Clement; Dickenson, Ruth E; Ficarelli, Mattia; Howard, Mark; Betancor, Gilberto; Galao, Rui Pedro; Pickering, Suzanne; Signell, Adrian W; Wilson, Harry; Cliff, Penny; Patel, Amita; MacMahon, Eithne; Cunningham, Emma; Agromayor, Monica; Martin-Serrano, Juan; Perucha, Esperanza; Mischo, Hannah E; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Batra, Rahul; Edgeworth, Jonathan; Malim, Michael; Neil, Stuart; Martinez-Nunez, Rocio Teresa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df01fded4c8970b837cf586c5d3a26a4662de15c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.20074351","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA","PCR Biosystems","Centre for Disease Control","CDC","Public Health England"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["qPCR reagents","Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit","Step Master Mix","step RT-qPCR Master Mix brands","QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit","detection of SARS","qPCRBIO Probe","Viral DNA","SARS-CoV","clinical samples","viral N gene","available RNA extraction methods","kit-free handling procedures","Luna","Fast Virus","TaqMan","RdRP-SARSr primer-probe set","supply of reagents","reliable detection","low viral titres","clinical diagnostic laboratories","PHE","small laboratories","laboratories resort","RdRP gene region","nucleic acid detection","worldwide shortage of reagents","manual handling","N2 primer-probes","commercial platforms","Public Health England","QIAgen","guidelines","Mag","ThermoFisher Scientific","current situation of extraordinary high demand","Beckman","PCR Biosystems","sensitivity","clear bottleneck","developed RNAdvance Blood","Disease Control","CDC","primers","integrated end-to-end solutions","Charite","testing portable","multiple workflows","regions","ROX","Omega Bio-tek","similar results","NEB","established robust pipelines","Centre","N1","settings","minimal impact","order","data","heat inactivation","protocol","capacity","facilities"],"language":"en"},

This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis.

There has been lack of clarity on the meaning of reported rates of false positives and false negatives. For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a non-infected person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity permits one to predict the test result given a person\u0027s true infection status. These predictions are not directly relevant to risk assessment or clinical decisions, where one knows a test result and wants to predict whether a person has been infected. Given estimates of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the rate of illness in the population. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of inference on the PPV and NPV of COVID-19 antibody tests given estimates of sensitivity and specificity and credible bounds on prevalence. I explain the methodological problem, show how to estimate bounds on PPV and NPV, and apply the findings to some tests authorized by the FDA.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manski, C.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Y.; Luo, R.; Wang, K.; Zhang, M.; Wang, Z.; Dong, L.; Li, J.; Yao, Y.; Ge, S.; Xu, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8829e65a48d0f8b96d456aff210b72c918ba5287.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.18.20023242v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of kidney impairment","kidney dysfunction","kidney impairment indicators","awareness of kidney impairment","hospital death","proteinuria hematuria","consecutive COVID19 patients","hospitalized COVID","acute kidney injury","prevalence of elevated serum creatinine","AKI","consecutive cohort study of COVID","study period","tertiary teaching hospital","higher risk","elevated urea nitrogen","serum creatinine concentration","Wuhan","blood urea nitrogen","independent risk factor","disease severity","leukocyte count","coronavirus disease","lymphocyte count","laboratory databases","median age","Kaplan-Meier analysis","electronic hospitalization databases","impact of abnormal urine analysis","branches","sex","clinical parameters","Cox proportional hazard regression","Incidence rate","years","adjustment","confounders","Information","major outbreak","Background","Conclusion","quartile range","Results","Method","Clinicians","Association","women","admission"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age [\u2265]75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI\u003E40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation \u003C88% (OR 6.99, 95% CI 4.5-11.0), d-dimer\u003E2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), ferritin \u003E2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) \u003E200 (OR 5.78, 95% CI, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age \u003E65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was SpO2\u003C88, followed by procalcitonin \u003E0.5, troponin \u003C0.1 (protective), age \u003E64 and CRP\u003E200.

Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively.

A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking. METHODS Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays. RESULTS Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples. CONCLUSIONS We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release. We discuss the involvement of critical regulatory pathways.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bryce, C.; Grimes, Z.; Pujadas, E.; Ahuja, S.; Beasley, M.

The virus packaging efficiency of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 (S with C-terminal 18 amino acid truncation) is much higher than VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S. A neutralization assay for antibody screening and serum neutralizing titer quantification was established based on VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpressed BHK21 cell (BHK21-hACE2). The experimental results can be obtained by automatically counting EGFP positive cell number at 12 hours after infection, making the assay convenient and high-throughput. The serum neutralizing titer of COVID-19 convalescent patients measured by VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus assay has a good correlation with live SARS-CoV-2 assay.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route.

The slope $\\alpha$ is different for different states. Following recent work by Notari (arxiv:2003.12417), we then consider the dependency of the $\\alpha$ for different states on the average maximum and minimum temperatures, the average relative humidity and the population density in each state. It turns out that like other countries, the parameter $\\alpha$, which determines the rate of rise of the number of infected individuals, seems to have a weak correlation with the average maximum temperature of the state. In contrast, any significant variation of $\\alpha$ with humidity or minimum temperature seems absent with almost no meaningful correlation. Expectedly, $\\alpha$ increases (slightly) with increase in the population density of the states; however, the degree of correlation here too is negligible. These results seem to barely suggest that a natural cause like a hot summer (larger maximum temperatures) may contribute towards reducing the transmission of the virus, though the role of minimum temperature, humidity and population density remains somewhat obscure from the inferences which may be drawn from presently available data.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Anushree; Kar, Sayan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/070581ea33b711b5ebba229dd98bde74bd0ba548.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["different states","alpha t","number of infected individuals","average maximum temperature","population density","reasonable number of individuals","minimum temperatures","average relative humidity","role of minimum temperature","larger maximum temperatures","weak correlation","virus","meaningful correlation","degree of correlation","available data","hot summer","simple linear function","date","gamma","natural cause","rate of rise","recent work","Notari","arxiv","significant variation","India","Covid","growth","contrast","inferences","period","countries","parameter","increases","slope","countrywide lockdown","transmission","dependency","results"],"language":"en"},

There is a paucity of data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. In this paper, we sought to provide an epidemiologic description of patients who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Vietnam. Methods. Data were abstracted from the wikipedia\u0027s COVID-19 information resource and Johns Hopkins University Dashboard. Demographic data and treatment status were obtained for each patient in each day. The coverage period was from 23/1/2020 to 10/4/2020. Descriptive analyses of incident cases were stratified by gender and age group. The estimation of the reproduction ratio was done with a bootstrap method using the R statistical environment. Results. During the coverage period, Vietnam has recorded 257 cases of COVID-19. Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%).

Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition amongst COVID-19 patients. Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is common in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. It is unknown whether RAAS inhibition with ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can be harmful or beneficial. Methods: Within Hackensack Meridian Health network, the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey, we performed a retrospective, multicenter, convenience sampling study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were manually abstracted. Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression were performed. Results: Among 3017 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1584 (52.5%) carried a diagnosis of hypertension. In the discharged or deceased cohort, the overall mortality was significantly increased at 35% vs 13% among COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, when adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was greatly diminished, with a reduction in odds-ratio by over half; and completely disappeared when adjusted for other major covariates. The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses. RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (p=0.001). Conclusions: While our results are limited by the retrospective nature of our study and by potential confounders, our data argue against a harmful effect of RAAS inhibition and support the HFSA/AHA/ACC joint statement recommending continuing ACE1 and ARB therapy in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ip, Andrew; Parikh, Kaushal; Parrillo, Joseph E; Mathura, Shivam; Hansen, Eric; Sawczuk, Ihor S; Goldberg, Stuart L","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08a6f5df95eb61c18d74705cbb6cee88e28c7310.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20077388v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFSA/AHA/ACC","ARB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hypertensive COVID","hypertensive patients","anti-hypertensive agents","effect of hypertension","convenience sampling study of hospitalized COVID","harmful effect of RAAS inhibition","diagnosis of hypertension","RAAS inhibitor therapy","ACE1 inhibitors","continuing ACE1","ARB therapy","overall mortality","mortality rates","Results","renin-angiotensin","retrospective nature","angiotensin-receptor blockers","common pre-existing condition","largest healthcare provider","Hackensack Meridian Health network","ACC joint statement","inflammation","New Jersey","HFSA","aldosterone system","ensuing cytokine storm","clinical characteristics","treatments","Fishers exact tests","logistic regression","Methods","deceased cohort","data","potential confounders","odds-ratio","Demographics","outcomes","reduction","half","Upregulation","ARBs","comorbidities","elderly","major covariates","unadjusted analyses","Conclusions","Introduction","vs"],"language":"en"},

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Smura, Teemu; Pr\u00E4hauser, Barbara; Windbichler, Katharina; Bl\u00FCmich, Sandra; Ramis, Antonio; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7149b8b4c8a338d95a56a676b3916da200eddc7c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nidoviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland","Spain","Morelia"],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract","python nidoviruses","nidovirus infection","nidovirus genome","nidovirus nucleoprotein","unknown nidoviruses","novel nidovirus species","broad cell","recent years nidoviruses","systemic spread","important respiratory pathogen of reptiles","broad spectrum of tissues","broad spectrum of epithelial","nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species","complexity of viruses","broad spectrum of target cells","alimentary tract","rapid spread","mentioned human viruses","captive python populations","emerged SARS-CoV","organ systems","systemic disease","order of animal","gastrointestinal tropism","MERS-CoV","Switzerland","course of infection","fibrinonecrotic lesions","order nidovirales","variety of lesions","virus isolates","present study","atypical tissue tropism associates","alimentary epithelium","intravascular monocytes","blood monocytes","primary cause of fatal disease","endothelial cells","length genome","observed phenotypes","important zoonotic pathogens","captive snake collections","fatal proliferative pneumonia","relevance of natural animal diseases","inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures","hepatocytes","similar characteristics","post mortem examinations","renal tubules","inflammation","consequence of monocyte","intralesional macrophages","changes","subfamily","pancreatic ducts","Immunohistochemistry","immunofluorescence staining","cases","threat","Analysis of viral genomes","entire body","Spain","high morbidity","mortality","generation","evidence","IMPORTANCE","results","observations"],"language":"en"},

Methods All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications. Results A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%). Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. Conclusions The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities. Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ippolito, Davide; Maino, Cesare; Pecorelli, Anna; Allegranza, Pietro; Cangiotti, Cecilia; Capodaglio, Carlo; Mariani, Ilaria; Giandola, Teresa; Gandola, Davide; Bianco, Ilaria; Ragusi, Maria; Franzesi, Cammillo Talei; Corso, Rocco; Sironi, Sandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95709adc64d45790b14e7bc3120592f2907fac45.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120301761; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120301761?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interstitial opacities","AO opacities","alveolar opacities","glass opacities","X-ray imaging","X-ray findings","Older patients","X-ray images","days","common X-ray pattern","symptoms onset","clinical symptoms","imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray","cut-off","emergency departments","comparison","Emergency setting","SARS-CoV","Lung lesions","peripheral predominance","infection","emergency radiology department","following findings","clinical data","years old","years of experience","RT-PCR positive","time interval","case","laboratory","novel Coronavirus","discrepancy","presence of ground","younger ones","reliable diagnostic tool","Abstract Objectives","Conclusions","groups","consolidations","pleural effusion","Computed tomography","suspicion of complications","total","Methods","radiologists"],"language":"en"},

Data as of April 11, 2020 show that flattening strategy for COVID-19 in both the world and the U.S. is working so well that a significantly effective removal of social distancing (aka unlock) at any time in the next few years, other than after widespread and effective vaccination, will produce a rebound overloading the healthcare system. For the world, by early April flattening was working so well that a world rebound could be projected in 2021 that would exceed in critical demand even the additional million or so ventilators requested by world governments. In the U.S., whose trajectory is somewhat ahead of the world, the projected rebound of a late year unlock is already greater than the current crisis projected peak. Most citizens are tacitly expecting much sooner rather than much later unlocks. Leaving economies locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe, especially for countries that cannot provide substantial economic aid to their citizens. An SIR-type model was used with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities, and an additional simulation of a decision-maker on selected-day partial unlock designed mainly to manage ventilator or other critical resource utilization, to make sure they are neither idle nor over committed. Using certain days of the week, already practiced by some countries, is not a necessary part of the method, but was used in the simulation to give a highly quantified unlock scheme. It also helps restore economic activity. While the model shows total cumulative cases, and therefore deaths, declining initially with flattening, when flattening begins to produce large rebounds the death rate goes back up. Partial unlock to manage critical resources brings the cumulative cases down about 8-12% between now and the second half of 2021, and therefore saves lives with some degree of certainty.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shuler, Robert L; Koukouvitis, Theodore","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b410ba6d11724c4f95574d1bb0e918caea57dfac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20064139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["world rebound","total cases","total cumulative cases","projected rebound","world governments","flattening strategy","critical resource utilization","late intervention","early intervention","economic activity","additional simulation","COVID","critical resources","countries","critical demand","citizens","economic shutdown duration","medical resource utilization","substantial economic aid","late year","effective vaccination","death rate","long time","selected-day partial","SIR-type model","loop caseload management method","effective removal of social distancing","clear parameters suitable","decision-maker","significant scenario variation","herd immunity threshold","public information","groups","balance","containment","deaths","predictive capabilities","stability","usefulness","current crisis","human","week","large rebounds","catastrophe","ventilators","certain days","paper","economies","years","healthcare system","degree of certainty","scheme","sooner","trajectory","Data","half"],"language":"en"},

We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes based on the above study to optimise the heat-treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed the published results, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used virus transport media (VTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, emphasising the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most adapted reagents to be used depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, although the method works, with very consistent Ct values and an excellent sensitivity when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method, it is critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvez, R.

Some report possible curative effects, others do not. In order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic, we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough (i.e. when viral loads range from 1 to 1,000 copies/mL). Although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported. Moreover, the effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively SARS-Cov-2-infected cells. On the whole, the present study suggests that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window, which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses. These considerations may have implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarino, Andrea; Tarek, Mohammad","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8883f2335e3b638bd3cc9d0b8a5376cbad54d95c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076471v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hydroxychloroquine","theoretical drug response","effects of chloroquine","theoretical drug distribution","effect of chloroquine","SARS-Cov","development of anti-COVID","viral clearance","etiological agent of COVID","trough plasma concentrations","possible scenarios of response","viral load peak","viral loads range","blood concentrations","report possible curative effects","regard","potential antiviral activity","mathematical modelling","combination therapies","lung","subject of intense debate","cell-mediated responses","controversial topic","amplitude","implications","narrow therapeutic window","prevention strategies","light","results","capacity","authors","computer-aided simulations","impact","present study","infected cells","highest tolerated doses","clinical trials","copies","considerations","account","patients","order"],"language":"en"},

Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity.

The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p\u003C0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lou, Bin; Li, Tigndong; Zheng, Shufa; Su, Yingying; Li, Zhiyong; Liu, Wei; Yu, Fei; Ge, Shengxiang; Zou, Qianda; Yuan, Quan; Lin, Sha; Hong, Congming; Yao, Xiangyang; Zhang, Xuejie; Wu, Dinghui; Zhou, Guoliang; Hou, Wangheng; Li, Tingting; Zhang, Yali; Zhang, Shiyin; Fan, Jian; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Chen, Yu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c509c214b517166ebe3dc963e478a9033517a83b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041707","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG antibody","total antibody","IgM","antibody levels","antibody dynamics","infection","diagnosis value of antibody test","SARS-CoV","IgG detection","patients","well-validated antibody tests","sensitivities of Ab","Conclusions Typical acute antibody response","RNA test needs","Background Timely diagnosis of SARS","serology testing","serology characteristics","control of COVID","pathogenic specific diagnosis","detectible serology marker","Serial sera of COVID","seroconversion rate","day post exposure","median seroconversion time","patient cohort study","days post onset","adapted immunity status of patient","clinical management","helpful information","important complementation","public health practice","prerequisite","affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University","China","treatment","early stage of illness","preventive quarantine","Method","highest sensitivity","decline of viral load","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Our results suggest that theaflavin could be the candidate of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor for further study.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lung, Jrhau; Lin, Yu-Shih; Yang, Yao-Hsu; Chou, Yu-Lun; Chang, Geng-He; Tsai, Ming-Shao; Hsu, Cheng-Ming; Yeh, Reming-Albert; Shu, Li-Hsin; Cheng, Yu-Ching; Liu, Hung Te; Wu, Ching-Yuan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b099da4f9383a056bc0c84d45b11622e90ba2214.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["theaflavin","RBD","contact area of SARS","kcal","mol","Val503 of SARS","candidate of SARS","S1 subunit of SARS","lower idock score","FullFitness score","direct contact area","contact modes","ACE2","study","viral entry","entry inhibitor","receptor binding domain","Cys480","host cells","Asn460","Gln493","Asn501","favorable interaction","Arg454","Phe456","additional hydrogen bonds","hydrophobic interactions","estimated \u0394G","COVID","angiotensin","spike protein","important therapeutic target","Outbreak of coronavirus disease","coronaviruses","SwissDock service","enzyme","parts of world","Wuhan","results"],"language":"en"},

The probability density function is log-normal in the number of hospitalizations, which is useful in describing pandemics where the number of hospital- izations is very high. Findings We used this insight and data to make forecasts for states using Monte Carlo methods. Back testing validates our approach, which yields good results about a week into the future.

Abstract COVID-19 is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health challenge. Due to a lack of knowledge about the virus, a significant number of potential targets for using a particular drug have been proposed. Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here. The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome. The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montealegre-G\u00F3mez, Giovanni; Garavito, Edgar; G\u00F3mez-L\u00F3pez, Arley; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Parra-Medina, Rafael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90e219bbd4d94b93e4aebad176149556209ad27a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1699258X20301078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1699258X20301078?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["In the SARS","and the inflammasome","in patients with COVID","test de SARS","lack of knowledge about the virus","The possible mechanisms that colchicine may","cytokine levels as well as the activation of","and arthralgias","Resumen COVID","Abstract COVID","clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis","severe symptoms and three of them died","Five cases with","also reviewed in","crisis de AI","tratamiento de colchicina debido","casos","cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non","significant number of potential targets for using","altered where colchicine","specific symptoms","s\u00EDntomas espec\u00EDficos","reto global","infection different inflammatory pathways","global public health challenge","Their close contacts had mild","particular drug have been proposed","ARDS","prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome","headache","cough without dyspnoea","neutrophils","SDRA","become","regi\u00F3n gl\u00FAtea","s\u00EDndrome de distr\u00E9s respiratorio agudo","biopol\u00EDmeros","activaci\u00F3n de macr\u00F3fagos","objetivos potenciales","historia cl\u00EDnica","artralgias","disnea","alogenosis iatrog\u00E9nica","cefalea","pacientes","Due","resultado positivo","article","newly","n\u00FAmero significativo","contactos cercanos","presented here","niveles de citocinas","neutr\u00F3filos","inflamasoma","salud p\u00FAblica","graves","f\u00E1rmaco","posibles mecanismos","enfermedad de aparici\u00F3n reciente","art\u00EDculo","falta de conocimiento","rutas inflamatorias","infecci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

In patients mechanically ventilated with advance airways cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuver may be simplified by keeping the ventilator on. This work assessed the response of a intensive care mechanical ventilator to CPR using a patient manikin ventilated in three conventional modes. Methods: Volume controlled (VCV), pressure controlled (PCV) and pressure regulated volume controlled (PRVC) ventilation were applied in a thorax physical model with or without chest compressions. The mechanical ventilator was set with inspiratory time of 1.0 s, ventilation rate of 10 breaths/minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 1.0, target tidal volume of 600 ml and trigger level of -20 cmH2O. Airway opening pressure and ventilatory flow signals were continuously recorded. . Results: Chest compression resulted in increased airway peak pressure in all ventilation modes (p\u003C0.001), specially with VCV (137% in VCV, 83% in PCV, 80% in PRVC). However, these pressures were limited to levels similar to release valves in manual resuscitators (~60 cmH2O). In pressure controlled modes tidal/minute volumes decreased (PRVC=11%, p=0.027 and PCV=12%, p\u003C0.001), while still within the variability observed during bag-valve-mask ventilation. During VCV, variation in tidal/minute volumes were not significant (p=0.140). Respiratory rates were constant with and without chest compression. Conclusions: A intensive care mechanical ventilator could provide adequate ventilation during compressions in a manikin model while using conventional ventilation modes.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neumamm, L.

Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed many similarities to the human-associated Influenza C virus, including the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.

It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing measures, with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19.We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, Canada, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical distancing (also known as social distancing)has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66-0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures - if sufficiently strong and robustly followed - could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Sean C; Edwards, Andrew M; Yerlanov, Madi; Mulberry, Nicola; Stockdale, Jessica; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca C; Otterstatter, Michael C.; Irvine, Michael A; Janjua, Naveed Z; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20070086v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Columbia"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["intermittent distancing measures","social distancing","Extensive physical distancing measures","projected impact of relaxing distancing measures","prevalence of COVID","strong impact","reported cases","British Columbia","observation model","high prevalence","Bayesian epidemiological model","threshold re-","proportion of individuals","survey data","extent of underestimation","hospitalization","declines","primary intervention","criteria","Canada","wide range","intensive care unit numbers","rapid exponential growth","time","delay","symptom onset","coronavirus disease","attitudes","timing","contact rate","additional uncertainty","changes","reporting","epidemic curve","population","fraction","projections","transmission","contacts"],"language":"en"},

Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 \u00B5M) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Lin; Chopra, Pradeep; Li, Xiuru; Wolfert, Margreet A.; Tompkins, S.

As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsamman, Alsamman M.; Zayed, Hatem","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.080960","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV2 infection","response gene","virogenomic transcriptome of infection","cellular gene response","gene signature","comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection","interaction of cellular targets","H1N1","Ebola","virogenomic signatures","MERS-CoV","IL","viral infections","high interaction activity","severe inflammatory response","global mortality rate","gene modulation of host antiviral responses","AGE-RAGE","valid targets","FOXO1 genes","pathogenic viruses","genetic pathways","global crisis","high significance","recovery rate","different respiratory viruses","time molecular pathways","PPI study sheds light","Malaria","system","Heparin-binding","Rheumatoid arthritis","Influenza","miRNA","FGF1","shares","unique anti-COVID1","Hepatitis B","potential therapy","terms","therapeutic development","key associations","PLA2 inhibitors","SAA2","lives","pandemic","way of life","findings","SERPINB1","work","immune regulation","NRCAM","cytokines","aim"],"language":"en"},

Further, microvascular thrombosis has recently been demonstrated in patients with COVID-19, and has been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of organ injury in this disease. In many of these conditions, microvascular thrombosis is accompanied by inflammation, an association referred to as thromboinflammation. In this review, we discuss endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent thrombosis in the microcirculation, experimental approaches to induce microvascular thrombi, and clinical conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis. A greater understanding of the links between inflammation and thrombosis in the microcirculation is anticipated to provide optimal therapeutic targets for patients with diseases accompanied by microvascular thrombosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bray, Monica A.; Sartain, Sarah A.; Gollamudi, Jahnavi; Rumbaut, Rolando E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b75a8d84675bf1915cf26406721f9909c57e2463.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524420301080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524420301080?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microvascular thrombosis","deep venous thrombosis","microcirculation","microvascular thrombi","patients","clinical conditions","variety of significant human diseases","sickle cell disease","stroke","thrombotic microangiopathy","intravascular coagulation","myocardial infarction","experimental approaches","optimal therapeutic targets","endogenous regulatory mechanisms","links","large vessels","review","pathogenesis of organ injury","greater understanding","research","association","thromboinflammation","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Results Our phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th.

In order to assess the preventive strategy adopted in Algeria, we studied three zones whole Algeria, Blida region, and whole Algeria except Blida, we used as a indicator the basic reproduction number R0, we compared the mean R0-before and R0-after the implementation of the mitigation measures using bivariate analysis, then we used the results we found to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases avoided by these measures, then after, we predicted the peak of the first wave of the epidemic. We note that the decrease in R0 after the preventive measures implementation was statistically significant, p value \u003C 10-4, in the three areas, thus, the preventive strategy in Algeria has been effective in its entirety. Our projection revealed that 15613 cases of COVID-19 were avoided in 14 days, from April 6, to April 19, 2020, in the whole country, and 1747 cases were prevented in Blida during the same period. We estimate that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic in Algeria will be reached with herd immunity of 15.93% as of November 2020, however, at least 56% of people with protective immunity would be needed to be sufficient to avoid a second wave. The used method to carry out the evaluation has given us a good overview, but, R0 is not the only factor to consider when estimating the burden of the epidemic, to do that, the number of daily admissions to intensive care units and hospitalizations remain good indicators. In order to better the epidemic control in Algeria, it is possible to act on contact efficacy rate by adding an instruction to wear medical mask by ordinary population outside, this measure has been reported to be effective in some countries. To conclude, it is good to keep in mind that a new way of life based on good hygiene habits and social distancing must therefore be in place and adopted by the population for at least several months, otherwise the demand for health care will exceed the availability.

Abstract Although the \u2018panic\u2019 word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder \u2013 i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities \u2013 are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javelot, H; Weiner, L","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2949f6241cbffdf7c74b46f69e349f0d585d65de.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300956; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300956?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aggravation of panic disorder","tel trouble et","trouble panique dans","en consid\u00E9ration","panique associ\u00E9 \u00E0","trouble panique qualifi\u00E9","COVID","increased risk of panic disorder onset","aggravation of panic attacks","ou situations","obsessive-compulsive disorder","encore en cas","diarrh\u00E9es et","pand\u00E9mie en cours","en pr\u00E9sentent d\u00E9j\u00E0","trouble anxieux g\u00E9n\u00E9ralis\u00E9","psychotropes \u00E0 risque","projections g\u00E9n\u00E9ralistes en","generalized anxiety disorder","notamment en lien avec","ou vomissements","patients anxieux","risk of onset","doivent inciter \u00E0 certaines pr\u00E9cautions en mati\u00E8re","ou encore l\u2019hydroxyzine","\u00E0 s\u2019interroger sur","trouble obsessionnel compulsif","\u00E0 vis\u00E9e anxiolytique","pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et","prominent respiratory symptoms","trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cit\u00E9 et l\u2019\u00E9vocation","post-traumatic stress disorder","pand\u00E9mie li\u00E9e au SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","stress post-traumatique et","citalopram et l\u2019escitalopram","coronavirus disease","nature \u00E0 resituer l\u2019importance","L\u2019hypokali\u00E9mie est associ\u00E9e \u00E0","ou \u00EAtre intensifi\u00E9 chez","risk of hypokalemia","risk of increase","current epidemic","troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait g\u00E9n\u00E9rer ou aggraver","il convient donc \u00E9galement d\u2019\u00EAtre prudent en mati\u00E8re","donn\u00E9es concr\u00E8tes concernent \u00E0 ce stage davantage","notamment chez","fear conditioning","anxiety disorders","current situation","studies","hypervigilance","people","que quelques \u00E9valuations s\u2019int\u00E9ressent au cadre nosographie","Bien que d\u2019une l\u00E9gitimit\u00E9 clinique encore d\u00E9battue","specific at-risk situations","fear response conditioning","case of salbutamol prescription","risque accru","comme avec","prescriptions m\u00E9dicamenteuses","d\u00E9j\u00E0 fourni","interoceptive sensations","psychiatric disorders","interoceptive signals","D\u2019\u00E9ventuelles situations co-morbides entre","antid\u00E9presseurs indiqu\u00E9s dans","Ces donn\u00E9es sont","abnormal breathing patterns attributable","pointe","torsade","traitements","respiratoire","surconsommation","PTSD","OCD","litt\u00E9rature","source potentielle","pandemic","subtype","sources d\u2019hypokali\u00E9mie","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 L\u2019\u00E9tat","maintenance factors","consequence","l\u2019infection","scientific literature","supplante largement","poor illness prognosis","GAD","abnormalities","instance","diarrhea","vomiting","word","comorbidity","dyspnea","treatment of panic disorder","diagnosis","increased risk of torsade","caution","current pandemic","hydroxyzine","specific psychotropic drugs","antidepressants citalopram","line treatments","escitalopram","anxiety reduction","Hypokalemia","impact","importance","results"],"language":"en"},

Methods This is a prospective, observational, epidemiological study in strict adherence to the STROBE guidelines.

Results An analysis of the 1,298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions. The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only. Moreover, a trend towards decline in emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by fewer trauma, but partly attributed to a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid haemorrhage.

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84.9% had performed [\u2265]1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed [\u2265]1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seale, H.; Heywood, A.

The WHO and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were characterized. Results: A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia, and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Sha; Fu, Xiaoyu; Song, Yang; Li, Min; Pan, Pin-hua; Tang, Tao; Zhang, Chunhu; Jiang, Tiejian; Tan, Deming; Fan, Xuegong; Sha, Xinping; Ma, Jingdong; Huang, Yan; Li, Shaling; Zheng, Yixiang; Qian, Zhaoxin; Xiong, Zeng; Xiao, Lizhi; Long, Huibao; Chen, Jianghai; Ouyang, Yi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17de28ebcf5e84031aec3acd10e45e62bc14f594.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051763","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prolonged SARS-CoV","dynamic viral shedding","longest viral shedding","prolonged interval of viral shedding","poor recovery groups","management of patients","Conclusions Patients","delayed intermittent viral shedding","lung lesion evolutions","hypoproteinemia","hyperlipemia","prognosis of severe COVID","serological characteristics of SARS","odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions","clinical characteristics","chest","IgM positive","Older age","total","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","confirmed coronavirus disease","corticosteroid usage","Disease Control","corticosteroid therapy","predicative factors","risk factors","interim clinical guidance","infection","pro-inflammatory response","Prevention","CDC","virologic","consolidation","days","United States Center","elevated levels of IL","proinflammatory responses","Background","tomography","potential relationships","limited data","symptom onset","pandemic","substantial morbidity","mortality","ferritin","addition","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P \u003C 0.001; 0.43 [\u2264] d [\u2264] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (\u002B15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period.

We used Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM) clustering algorithm to develop web-network of confirmed cases to identified clusters of community transmission. Results: Out of 1192 confirmed cases, 90.60% were symptomatic and 9.39% were asymptomatic. The prevalence of COVID19 in males was 56.29% and 43.20 % in females.

Planners need forecasts of the most likely trajectory in the coming weeks and will want to plan for the higher values in the range of those forecasts. To date, forecasts of what is most likely to occur in the weeks ahead are not available for states in the USA or for all countries in the EEA. Methods: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from local and national government websites and WHO. Data on hospital capacity and utilisation and observed COVID-19 utilisation data from select locations were obtained from publicly available sources and direct contributions of data from select local governments. We develop a mixed effects non-linear regression framework to estimate the trajectory of the cumulative and daily death rate as a function of the implementation of social distancing measures, supported by additional evidence from mobile phone data. An extended mixture model was used in data rich settings to capture asymmetric daily death patterns. Health service needs were forecast using a micro-simulation model that estimates hospital admissions, ICU admissions, length of stay, and ventilator need using available data on clinical practices in COVID-19 patients. We assume that those jurisdictions that have not implemented school closures, non-essential business closures, and stay at home orders will do so within twenty-one days. Findings: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand in the USA from COVID-19 at the estimated peak of the epidemic (the end of the second week of April) is predicted to be 9,079 (95% UI 253-61,937) total beds and 9,356 (3,526-29,714) ICU beds. At the peak of the epidemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 16,545 (8,083-41,991). The corresponding numbers for EEA countries are 120,080 (119,183-121,107), 32,291 (32,157-32,425) and 28,973 (28,868-29,085) at a peak of April 6. The date of peak daily deaths varies from March 30 through May 12 by state in the USA and March 27 through May 4 by country in the EEA. We estimate that through the end of July, there will be 60,308 (34,063-140,381) deaths from COVID-19 in the USA and 143,088 (101,131-253,163) deaths in the EEA. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 0.3 per million between May 4 and June 29 by state in the USA and between May 4 and July 13 by country in the EEA. Timing of the peak need for hospital resource requirements varies considerably across states in the USA and across regions of Europe. Interpretation: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the USA and EEA to manage, especially for ICU care and ventilator use. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasising the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Christopher JL","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074732v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Economic Area","USA","EEA","ICU"],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["USA","non-COVID","available data","confirmed COVID","hospital capacity","utilisation data","peak need","EEA countries","date of peak daily deaths","epidemic","estimated peak","hospital admissions","system capacity","data rich settings","hospital systems","direct contributions of data","mobile phone data","hospital system overload","estimated excess demand","large number of deaths","forecasts","licensed capacity","ICU admissions","implementation of social distancing measures","ventilator use","ICU beds","hospital resource requirements","current capacity of hospitals","enactment of social distancing measures","United States","daily death rate","available sources","likely trajectory","health system resources","ICU care","coming weeks","locations","country","estimates","asymmetric daily death patterns","school closures","non-essential business closures","local governments","implementation of strategies","length of stay","total beds","micro-simulation model","extended mixture model","Health service needs","average annual occupancy rates","additional evidence","function","clinical practices","European Economic Area","services","mixed effects non-linear regression framework","national government websites","gap","study","home orders","range","development","patients","corresponding numbers","surge","Timing","higher values","regions of Europe","Interpretation","Summary Background","jurisdictions","importance","enforcing","Findings","Planners","Methods","maintenance","days","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deasy, Jacob; Rocheteau, Emma; Kohler, Katharina; Stubbs, Daniel J.; Barbiero, Pietro; Li\u00F2, Pietro; Ercole, Ari","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bd626c6e2bf333c14247fa3e4781bf8764caf3c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039057","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","National Health Service"],"locations":["England","London","North East"],"keyphrases":["forecast model","surge ICU capacity","regional ICU capacity","East of England","ICU beds","case data","ICU occupancy","surge capacity","robust epidemiological data","plausible epidemiological data","North East","additional capacity","real-time COVID","time of modelling","terms of model specification","agile short-range forecast","accurate short-range forecast","National Health Service commissioning regions","North West","South West","uncertainties","ill COVID","modelling assumptions","national service reconfiguration","current exponential growth","likely impact of current diagnoses","absolute patients","variable growth","ongoing real-time surveillance","high quality local patient","reduction","Yorkshire","intensive care unit","admission","Midlands","London","unprecedented strain","urgent need","early prospective phase","Monte Carlo approach","cancellation of elective activity","forecasts","policy decision makers","weeks","todo","parts","literature available","inevitable lag","day horizon","challenging decisions","preparations","pandemic","attempt","work","cases","Strategies","thing","world","Theses measures","basis","days","future"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, they can be contagious to highly vulnerable individuals seeking health care. This study aims at estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and associated factors in HCW from a large referral hospital in Barcelona, Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 in the world. Methods: From 28 March to 9 April 2020, we recruited a random sample of 578 HCW from the human resources database of Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. We collected a nasopharyngeal swab for direct SARS-CoV-2 detection through real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), as well as blood for plasma antibody quantification. IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were measured by Luminex. The cumulative prevalence of infection (past or current) was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and/or antibody seropositivity. Results: Of the 578 total participants, 39 (6.7%, 95% CI: 4.8-9.1) had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 by rRT-PCR, 14 (2.4%, 95% CI: 1.4-4.3) had a positive rRT-PCR at recruitment, and 54 (9.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.0) were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA against SARS-CoV-2. Of the 54 seropositive HCW, 21 (38.9%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, although 10 of them (47.6%) reported past COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.2% (65/578, 95% CI: 8.9-14.1). Among those with evidence of past or current infection, 40.0% (26/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 46.2% (12/26) had history of COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The odds of being seropositive was higher in participants who reported any COVID-19 symptom (OR: 8.84, 95% CI: 4.41-17.73). IgM levels positively correlated with age (rho=0.36, p-value=0.031) and were higher in participants with more than 10 days since onset of symptoms (p-value=0.022), and IgA levels were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects (p-value=0.041). Conclusions: The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among HCW was lower than expected. Thus, being a high-risk population, we anticipate these estimates to be an upper limit to the seroprevalence of the general population. Forty per cent of those with past or present infection had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, which calls for active periodic rRT-PCR testing among all HCW to minimize potential risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Basteiro, A.

Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex - a homolog of the F1 ATPase motor - within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the \u2018locked\u2019 ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a \u2018free\u2019 excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: \u03C9max \u2248 9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: Pmax \u2248 42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: Gstall \u2248 3 kBT/rad. Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously \u2018grinding\u2019 through the resistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucera, Jiri; Terentjev, Eugene M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fb17e4d2ec9aae70087b85e6805ae8cb5c50bd7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.978379","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FliJ filament","FliI6-FliJ complex","flagellar export apparatus","flagellar export channel","flagellar proteins","function of FliI6","ground state","kBT","state model","excited state","FliI6 stator","stall torque","F1 ATPase motor","unfolding","states","FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations","role of rotational molecular motors","studies of linear molecular motors","rotational diffusion","transport channel","opposite stall force","external counter torque conditions","order","ATP synthase class","homolog","asymmetric torsional potential","maximal power output","Pmax","key features","flagellin subunits","average angular velocity","modes of action","\u03C9max","energy barrier","resistance","metabolism of cells","transitions","rps","Gstall","Michaelis-Menten kinetics","resistive environment","useful work","cases"],"language":"en"},

The possibility of virus transmission from patients with COVID-19 to medical staff is thus of primary concern. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could also be conceivable to act as a potent source of ongoing transmission.

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don\u2019t have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it, so, numerous research studies are needed to find potential.

Abstract Viruses play a significant role in serious infections in adults and sometimes lead to the need for hospitalization and admission to intensive care units, especially in cases of severe respiratory distress or encephalopathy. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses, syncytial respiratory virus, herpes viruses and adenovirures are the most frequent causes of these severe infections. A review of the literature has been performed in order to update the epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapeutic approach of viral infections affecting immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is mainly a bacterial disease, although the potential role of viruses as pathogens or copathogens in VAP is under discussion. Therefore, a brief review of the potential pathogenic role of viruses in VAP has also been performed.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDaz, A.; Zaragoza, R.; Granada, R.; Salavert, M.","journal":"Medicina Intensiva","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31105078a2953217223699d09c6a80d0f5edfdf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210569111000106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210569111000106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Las infecciones por virus influenza y parainfluenza","los virus como pat\u00F3genos en estas infecciones est\u00E1 en debate","herpes viruses","parainfluenza viruses","infecciones virales en pacientes inmunocompetentes","especialmente en casos","infecciones graves en los pacientes adultos","potential role of viruses","su papel etiopatog\u00E9nico en","virus sincitial respiratorio","herpes virus y adenovirus son","infecciones bacterianas","syncytial respiratory virus","Abstract Viruses","VAP","que en algunas ocasiones llegan","Resumen Los virus tienen","potential pathogenic role of viruses","severe infections","adulto y encefalitis","necesitar hospitalizaci\u00F3n e ingreso en unidades","neumon\u00EDa asociada","literatura pormenorizada y actualizada","intensive care units","significant role","serious infections","que se hace una breve revisi\u00F3n","manifestaciones cl\u00EDnicas y aproximaci\u00F3n terap\u00E9utica","papel importante dentro","Por otro lado","Se ha realizado una revisi\u00F3n","ventilaci\u00F3n mec\u00E1nica tiene como etiolog\u00EDa m\u00E1s frecuente","distr\u00E9s respiratorio","que m\u00E1s frecuentemente causan estos cuadros","therapeutic approach of viral infections","cases of severe respiratory distress","frequent causes","brief review","frequent nosocomial infection","patog\u00E9nesis","cuidados intensivos","epidemiolog\u00EDa","s\u00EDndrome","recientemente","si bien","pathogenesis","adenovirures","high morbidity","hospitalization","admission","adults","copathogens","immunocompetent patients","epidemiology","need","encephalopathy","order","mortality rate","ventilator-associated pneumonia","bacterial disease","literature","discussion"],"language":"en"},

Second, the simplicity of modelling the interactions between the individuals, which may not be the case when using differential equations. We propose to use freely available population density maps to simulate the infection spread in the human population on the scale of an individual country or a city. We explore the effect of social distancing and show that it can reduce the outbreak when applied before or during peak time, but it can also inflict the second wave when relaxed after the peak. This can be explained by a large proportion of susceptible individuals, even in the large cities, after the first wave.

Methods: We prospectively recruited health-care workers from our hospital between April 10 and April 20, 2020. We collected serum samples from these participants and evaluated quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Five (5.4%), 15 (16.3%) and 72 (78.3%) participants showed positive, borderline and negative results of the serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody, respectively. We found mean titer of the antibody levels of all, positive group, borderline group and negative group were clearly distinguished. Participants belonging to otolaryngology ward and/or having a history of seasonal common cold symptoms had significantly higher titer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody (p=0.046, p=0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Five (5.4%) and 15 (16.3%) participants showed positive and borderline SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody during COVID-19 peri-pandemic period. These rates were much higher than the rates expected from situation reports of the government. Higher rates of positive and borderline antibody suggested that COVID-19 had already spread at early stage of pandemic in the southern part of Kyoto city.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujita, K.; Kada, S.; Kanai, O.; Hata, H.; Odagaki, T.; Satoh-Asahara, N.; Tagami, T.; Yasoda, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37a6fb78381262b706ad347d759ddbf94484dfdc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20098962v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG antibody","borderline antibody","borderline SARS-CoV","serum SARS-CoV","antibody levels","COVID","participants","quantitative SARS-CoV","borderline group","positive group","higher titer of SARS","Higher rates of positive","health-care workers","peri-pandemic period","mental health","negative group","Pandemic of coronavirus disease","regional health care resource","serum samples","negative results","early stage of pandemic","serum severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","incidence rate","mean titer","case fatality rate","epidemiological data of prevalence","multidisciplinary approach","economic activity","history of seasonal common cold symptoms","patients physical","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","heavy burden","situation reports","world","Background","hospital","Kyoto city","otolaryngology ward","government","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

This commentary introduces innovative screening tests that are currently used in South Korea for COVID-19, e.g., Drive-Through and Walk-Through tests, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Sangchun; Han, Chul; Lee, Jisook; Kim, Sang-Il; Kim, In Byung","journal":"Clinical and experimental emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.15441/ceem.20.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease"],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["virus screening tests","South Korea","aggressive screening tests","innovative screening tests","Walk-Through tests","outbreaks","confirmed cases of COVID","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","presumed infection","accurate data reporting","quarantine inspection data transparency","number of Corona Virus Disease","SARS","public health lessons","triage clinics","deployment of rapid","healthcare staffs","MERS","emergency departments","related deaths","individual provinces","countries","high incidence rates","total","Drive","commentary","disadvantages","methods","patients","sharp increase"],"language":"en"},

In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. METHODS In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ \u002B standard treatment). CONCLUSION This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plaze, Marion; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-C\u00E9cile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chr\u00E9tien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Rapha\u00EBl","journal":"L\u0027Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPZ","ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["CPZ","anti-SARS-CoV","anti-COVID","anti-MERS-CoV","patients","ongoing COVID","antiviral activity","contagiousness of SARS","standard treatment","infection severity","lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID","unfavorable course of COVID","psychotropic drugs","repurposing strategy","rapid strategy","virulent forms","antiviral properties","GHU PARIS Psychiatrie","phase","Neuroscience","high biodistribution","respiratory support","therapeutic trial","Sainte Anne Hospital","experimental steps","excellent tolerance profile","need","inhibition of clathrin","prophylactic action","saliva","lungs","single blind","France","pandemic","molecule","precious time","alternative","ICU care","ReCoVery study","pilot","context","mediated endocytosis","OBJECTIVES","therapy","studies","phenothiazine derivative","METHODS","brain","clinical staff","Chlorpromazine","effects","purpose","infections","observation","CONCLUSION","individuals"],"language":"en"},

All maternity hospitals were informed to provide a protected labor and delivery room for nontransferable patients in advanced labor. A pre-triage based on temperature and 14 other items was developed in order to screen suspected patients in all hospitals to be tested with nasopharyngeal swabs. Obstetric outpatient facilities were instructed to maintain scheduled pregnancy screening as per Italian guidelines, and to provide pre-triage screening and surgical masks for personnel and patients for pre-triage-negative patients.

Much more serious than SARS-CoV in 2002, the current SARS-CoV-2 infection has been spreading to more than 213 countries, areas or territories and causing more than two million cases up to date (April 17, 2020). Unfortunately, no vaccine and specific anti-coronavirus drugs are available at present time. Current clinical treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and reverse organ failure. Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies.

A rapid review.","doi":"10.3399/bjgpopen20x101094","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32398343","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND There are no established effective treatments for COVID-19. While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN \u0026 SETTING A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin","journal":"BJGP open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20x101094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of azithromycin","safety of azithromycin","effectiveness of azithromycin","use of azithromycin","treatment of COVID","context of COVID","EPPI COVID","hydroxychloroquine","studies","adverse events profile of azithromycin","anti-SARS-CoV","patients","limited evidence","context of clinical trials","candidate treatment","Well-conducted clinical trials","conflicting results","rapid review","established effective treatments","superior viral clearance","high risk of bias","MedRxiv","Map","possible synergy","GoogleScholar","TRIP","BACKGROUND","PubMed","small trial","METHOD Electronic searches","bacterial super-infection","DESIGN","literature","comparator group","novel drugs","inclusion","area","CONCLUSION","pre-prints"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 5 infants, who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology in Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital from 31(st) January to 25(th) February 2020, were collected. Bedsides pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. Results: Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation. The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case. The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the same time. Conclusions: The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation. The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than that of chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, X Y; Tao, X W; Zeng, L K; Wang, W Q; Li, G","journal":"Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200228-00154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","pulmonary ultrasonography","diagnosis of pulmonary edema","pulmonary interstitial syndrome","application of pulmonary ultrasound","sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound","small range of pulmonary consolidation","chest CT","chest X-ray","admission","pulmonary edema of different severity","abnormal pleural line","small-range consolidation","small strip","fusion of B","hospitalization","discharge","time","main clinical manifestations","alveolar interstitial syndrome","diagnosis of neonatal COVID","Bedsides pulmondary ultrasound","clinical data","main changes","patchy high-density shadow","obvious parenchymal infiltration","neonates","gastrointestinal symptoms","ground glass change","Department of Neonatology","Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital","retrospective study","pneumonia","improvement","re-examination of ultrosound","monitoring","evaluation","disease","Methods","infants","Conclusions","days","male","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

AIMS This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19. RESULTS Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality. Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction. In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels. With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients. Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice. CONCLUSION While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aghagoli, Ghazal; Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Soliman, Luke B; Sellke, Frank W","journal":"Journal of cardiac surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","cardiac effects of COVID","cardiac implications of COVID","cardiac surgery","cardiac involvement","cardiac pathophysiology","cardiac presentations","studies","insights","pre-existing cardiovascular disease","existing body of literature","better clinical outcomes","greater frequency","myocardial protection","evidence of acute myocardial injury","acute pericarditis","English literature","poor outcomes","greater rates of mortality","novel coronavirus disease","study of cardiovascular diseases","actionable clinical practice","emerging body of research","BACKGROUND Respiratory complications","intensive care unit settings","increased serum troponin","dearth of data","SARS-CoV","cohesive understanding","clear guidelines","papers","informed treatment","surgical interventions","levels","information","MATERIALS","METHODS","ventricular dysfunction","regard","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","review"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the latencies of vibration-induced reflexes in individuals with and without spinal cord injury (SCI), and to compare these latencies to identify differences in reflex circuitries. SETTING A tertiary rehabilitation center in Istanbul. METHODS Seventeen individuals with chronic SCI (SCI group) and 23 participants without SCI (Control group) were included in this study. Latency of tonic vibration reflex (TVR) and whole-body vibration-induced muscular reflex (WBV-IMR) of the left soleus muscle was tested for estimating the reflex origins. The local tendon vibration was applied at six different vibration frequencies (50, 85, 140, 185, 235, and 265 Hz), each lasting for 15 s with 3-s rest intervals. The WBV was applied at six different vibration frequencies (35, 37, 39, 41, 43, and 45 Hz), each lasting for 15 s with 3-s rest intervals. RESULTS Mean (SD) TVR latency was 39.7 (5.3) ms in the SCI group and 35.9 (2.7) ms in the Control group with a mean (95% CI) difference of -3.8 (-6.7 to -0.9) ms. Mean (SD) WBV-IMR latency was 45.8 (7.4) ms in the SCI group and 43.3 (3.0) ms in the Control group with a mean (95% CI) difference of -2.5 (-6.5 to 1.4) ms. There were significant differences between TVR latency and WBV-IMR latency in both the groups (mean (95% CI) difference; -6.2 (-9.3 to -3.0) ms, p = 0.0001 for the SCI group and -7.4 (-9.3 to -5.6) ms, p = 0.011 for Control group).

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public-health crisis including more than 3.1 million cases and 224,000 deaths as of May 1, 2020. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jun; Babka, April M; Kearney, Brian J; Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Kuhn, Jens H; Zeng, Xiankun","journal":"JCI insight","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.139042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHC","ISH"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["respective SARS-CoV","positive-sense SARS-CoV","negative-sense SARS-CoV","molecular detection of SARS","mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein","suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody","COVID","IHC","assays","multiplex fluorescence ISH","cross detection","available reagents","immunofluorescence assay","FFPE section","dual staining assay","cause of human coronavirus disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","NP","infected formalin fixed paraffin","mFISH","humans","immunohistochemistry","proteins","replicative intermediate","pathogenesis studies","evaluation","antigen","viral replication","cell pellets","situ hybridization","identification","RNAscope","IFA","animal models","public-health crisis","cases","Wuhan","China","deaths"],"language":"en"},

We also compared whether the methods identify the optimal arterial blood pressure (ABPopt) and lower limit of autoregulation (LLA). 68 piglets were randomized to cardiac arrest or sham procedure with continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler, NIRS and ICP. The arterial blood pressure (ABP) was gradually reduced until it dropped to below the LLA. Several autoregulation indices were calculated using correlation and wavelet methods, including the pressure reactivity index (PRx and wPRx), cerebral oximetry index (COx and wCOx), and hemoglobin volume index (HVx and wHVx). Wavelet methodology had less index variability with smaller standard deviations. Both wavelet and correlation methods distinguished functional autoregulation (ABP above LLA) from dysfunctional autoregulation (ABP below the LLA). Both wavelet and correlation methods also identified ABPopt with high agreement. Thus, wavelet methodology using NIRS may offer an accurate vasoreactivity monitoring method with reduced signal noise after pediatric cardiac arrest.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiuyun; Hu, Xiao; Brady, Ken M; Koehler, Raymond; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek; Donnelly, Joseph; Lee, Jennifer K","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62435-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wavelet methods","index variability","pressure reactivity index","correlation methods","Wavelet methodology","LLA","autoregulation indices","cerebral oximetry index","intracranial pressure","optimal arterial blood pressure","NIRS","high index time-variability","dysfunctional autoregulation","Existing cerebrovascular blood pressure autoregulation metrics","pediatric cardiac arrest","hemoglobin volume index","lower limit of autoregulation","used correlation indices","continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow","reduced signal noise","ABPopt","ICP","accurate vasoreactivity monitoring method","high agreement","wCOx","wPRx","laser Doppler","sham procedure","infrared spectroscopy","clinical care","smaller standard deviations","wHVx","piglets"],"language":"en"},

In turn, universal precautions rely on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). During the SARS-CoV2 outbreak many healthcare workers across the globe have been reluctant to provide patient care because crucial PPE components are in short supply. The lack of such equipment during the pandemic was not a result of careful resource allocation decisions in the global north, where the short supply could be explained through their high cost. Instead, they were the result of democratically elected governments prioritising low tax regimes over an adequate resourcing of their healthcare delivery systems.

We herein present a single-center experience regarding a one-stage surgical strategy, including hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Over a 4-year period, 123 patients underwent peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation and 23 patients (19%) had concomitant abdominal wall hernias and were enrolled in this monocentric prospective study. Data collection included recurrent and new-onset hernias, surgical site infection, 1-year and 2-year catheter survival. RESULTS In 23 patients, 27 hernia repairs combined with peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation were performed. Median age was 52 years (range, 30-85 years) and 18/23 (78%) patients were male. There were no recurrent hernias and no early surgical site infections. Daily flushing was regularly started on the 1st to 3rd postoperative day. Five patients (22%) developed hernias on other anatomical sites, which required hernia repair and perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 28-87 months), 96% of all implanted catheters were still working. CONCLUSION Hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation are associated with no recurrent hernias, an early start of peritoneal dialysis, a very low postoperative morbidity and very high 1-year and 2-year catheter survival.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horvath, P; K\u00F6nigsrainer, A; M\u00FChlbacher, T; Thiel, K; Thiel, C","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02086-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PATIENTS","simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation","perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis","early start of peritoneal dialysis","dialysis method","recurrent hernias","year catheter survival","year period","concomitant abdominal wall hernias","CONCLUSION Hernia repair","new-onset hernias","hernia repairs","BACKGROUND Occurrence of abdominal wall hernias","early surgical site infections","range","years","months","stage surgical strategy","treatment discontinuation","median follow-up","Median age","postoperative day","low postoperative morbidity","failure","pivotal role","exclusion","anatomical sites","Data collection","single-center experience","METHODS","monocentric prospective study","RESULTS","Daily flushing","implanted catheters","male"],"language":"en"},

Accessing respite care services for children with an ASD can often be a daunting and exhaustive process, with parents sometimes forced to access acute hospital services as an initial point of contact for respite care or in a crisis situation. To gain an in-depth understanding of accessing respite care for children with an ASD, from the perspectives of parents, a systematic review of the evidence on parent\u0027s experiences and views of respite care for children with an ASD at the acute and primary interface was undertaken. METHODS Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO were systematically searched. Studies identified as relevant based on predetermined eligibility criteria were selected for inclusion. The search strategy also targeted unpublished studies and grey literature. Qualitative data and qualitative components of mixed method studies that represented the experiences of parents accessing respite care for children with an ASD were eligible for inclusion. A meta-aggregative approach was used during data synthesis. RESULTS Database searching elicited 430 records of which 291 studies remained after removal of duplicates. These 291 studies were screened for title and abstract by two reviewers resulting in 31 studies to be screened at full text and assessed for eligibility. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and a further additional study also met the inclusion criteria during a manual search. As a result, 7 studies were selected for the review as set out in Fig. 1. CONCLUSION In the absence of appropriate services and defined pathways to support services such as respite care, overwhelmed parents and community providers of mental health resources may not be in a position to meet the specific needs of children with an ASD and their families which may be contributing to a direct increase in hospitalizations. This systematic review identified a number of barriers to respite care, of which the findings can be used to inform future service development and further research. Knowledge of parental experiences in caring for a child with an ASD is vital in addressing the need and type of respite care required for children with an ASD.

The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to evaluate the impact of receiving a TS for cancer survivors when compared to receiving standard care and to identify knowledge gaps to inform future research. METHODS A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature was undertaken from August 2018 to October 2018. Studies were included if participants (cancer survivors) were over 18 years of age and had received a TS, and if outcomes for TS could be separated from other survivorship interventions. The McMaster Critical Appraisal Tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. A narrative synthesis of the study outcomes was then conducted. RESULTS Seven studies (one prospective cohort and six cross-sectional studies) met the inclusion criteria. The impact of TS was assessed using widely varied outcomes in these studies. Overall, receipt of a TS was related to greater patient understanding and perception of the quality of care provided. However, caution is required when interpreting these results due to methodological limitations. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review found that TS may have a positive impact on patient understandings about and perceptions of cancer care. However, more robust research including perspectives of cancer survivors is required.

With this Letter, we would like to give a testimony of our experience and give some advices to bridge the training gap.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Luca, Pietro; Colacurcio, Vito; De Bonis, Egidio; Petrosino, Michele; Bisogno, Antonella; Troisi, Donato; Calvanese, Matteo; Marra, Pasquale","journal":"Ear, nose, \u0026 throat journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320926291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Throat"],"organizations":["Healthcare System","Neck Department","University Hospitals"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deadly disease","coronavirus disease","residency training","training gap","Nose","Neck Department clinical","University Hospitals","Throat","residents","surgical activity","country","entire Italian Healthcare System","Ear","Head","physicians","uncertain position","high risk","advices","COVID","unprecedented condition","century","experience","trainees","situation","pandemic","testimony"],"language":"en"},

Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work \u0026 Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with \u0022negative effects\u0022. Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=116752).","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sundstrup, Emil; Seeberg, Karina Glies Vincents; Bengtsen, Elizabeth; Andersen, Lars Louis","journal":"Journal of occupational rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09879-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICO","MSD"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["strong evidence","evidence synthesis","workplace ergonomics","moderate evidence","limited evidence","multifaceted workplace interventions","effectiveness of workplace interventions","demanding work","Results Level of evidence","multifaceted interventions","non-specific MSD","positive effect of workplace strength training","measure of MSD","musculoskeletal pain","systematic search","group of workers","benefit of participatory ergonomics","musculoskeletal disorders","beneficial effect","symptoms","quality assessment","scientific literature","adult workers","review process","discomfort","Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752","positive effect of physical exercise","bibliographical search","non-RCTs","interventional domains","intervention domains","Relevant stakeholders","general conclusions","comparison group","medium quality studies","assessment of study relevance","Web of Science Core Collection","randomized controlled trials","PubMed","care","bibliographic databases","Canada","employees","MSDs","English articles","Health","Toronto","Institute","participants","prevalence","guidelines","PICO strategy","stress management","practical recommendations","current practices","negative effects","Methods","regard"],"language":"en"},

Clusters of severe respiratory disease are challenging to investigate, especially in resource-limited settings, and disease etiology often is not well understood. In 2014, endorsed by the Group of Seven (G7),* the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established to help build country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.\u2020 GHSA is a multinational, multisectoral collaboration to support countries towards full implementation of the World Health Organization\u0027s International Health Regulations (IHR).\u00A7 Initially, 11 technical areas for collaborator participation were identified to meet GHSA goals. CDC developed the Detection and Response to Respiratory Events (DaRRE) strategy in 2014 to enhance country capacity to identify and control respiratory disease outbreaks. DaRRE initiatives support the four of 11 GHSA technical areas that CDC focuses on: surveillance, laboratory capacity, emergency operations, and workforce development.\u00B6 In 2016, Kenya was selected to pilot DaRRE because of its existing respiratory disease surveillance and laboratory platforms and well-developed Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) (2). During 2016-2020, Kenya\u0027s DaRRE partners (CDC, the Kenya Ministry of Health [MoH], and Kenya\u0027s county public health officials) conceptualized, planned, and implemented key components of DaRRE. Activities were selected based on existing capacity and determined by the Kenya MoH and included 1) expansion of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance sites; 2) piloting of community event-based surveillance; 3) expansion of laboratory diagnostic capacity; 4) training of public health practitioners in detection, investigation, and response to respiratory threats; and 5) improvement of response capacity by the national emergency operations center (EOC). Progress on DaRRE activity implementation was assessed throughout the process. This pilot in Kenya demonstrated that DaRRE can support IHR requirements and can capitalize on a country\u0027s existing resources by tailoring tools to improve public health preparedness based on countries\u0027 needs.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Idubor, Osatohamwen I; Kobayashi, Miwako; Ndegwa, Linus; Okeyo, Mary; Galgalo, Tura; Kalani, Rosalia; Githii, Susan; Hunsperger, Elizabeth; Balajee, Arunmozhi; Verani, Jennifer R; da Gloria Carvalho, Maria; Winchell, Jonas; Van Beneden, Chris A; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Makayotto, Lyndah; Chaves, Sandra S","journal":"MMWR.

A 26-year-old man presented with traumatic injury from a wide, blunt wound of the right forearm caused by broken glass, with soft tissue loss, complete transection of the radial and ulnar arteries, and a large median nerve gap. The patient underwent debridement and subsequent surgery with a microsurgical free radial fasciocutaneous flap to provide a direct blood supply to the hand; the cephalic vein within the flap was employed as a venous vascularized chamber to wrap the sural nerve graft and to repair the wide gap (14 cm) in the median nerve. During the postoperative period, the patient followed an intensive rehabilitation program and was monitored for functional performance over 5 years of follow-up. Our assessment demonstrated skin tropism and sufficient muscle power to act against strong resistance (M5) in the muscles previously affected by paralysis, as well as a good localization of stimuli in the median nerve region and an imperfect recovery of two-point discrimination (S3\u002B).

Most of the reported cases focused specifically on the maternal outcomes and possible vertical transmission, but less attention has been paid to fetus as a patient in such pregnancies. The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported. Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate. Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high.

METHODS A pixel-based analysis of pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis. RESULTS From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure. INTERPRETATION In this large multi-centre study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure may be useful in clinical practice to predict haemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. This article is protected by copyright.

Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He took the second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course.

Despite their beneficial and ubiquitous use during surgery, delayed or partial recovery from NMBAs, referred to as residual neuromuscular block (rNMB), is a common clinical problem. While it is well accepted that the antagonist sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced NMB regardless of depth of block, the occurrence of rNMB for routinely used combinations of NMBAs with sugammadex or neostigmine has not yet been quantified or evaluated systematically. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to quantify and compare the incidence of rNMB [defined as train-of-four ratio (TOFR) \u003C0.9] in patients with moderate and deep neuromuscular block. Methods recommended by Cochrane Collaboration and PRISMA group were followed. RESULTS A total of 35 RCTs were identified, of which 20 contributed to the meta-analysis. For moderate block, rNMB incidence at 2 min after sugammadex administration was 19.2% (95% CI 0.0-57.8; 122 patients) and declined to 2.8% (95% CI 0.0-16.7; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 0.05% to 2.8%. In contrast, rNMB incidence at 2 min after neostigmine administration was 100% (95% CI 89.9-100; 182 patients) and was 82% (95% CI 71.4-91.2; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 14 and 32%. For deep block, rNMB incidence following sugammadex was essentially reduced to 1% at 15 min after administration. Residual NMB incidence following neostigmine remained at or above 95% for the first 60 min after administration. CONCLUSIONS Overall, based on evidence from 20 RCTs, our results suggest that the combination of rocuronium or vecuronium plus sugammadex is more effective and more rapid in reversing NMB compared with combinations of rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, or pancuronium plus neostigmine.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raval, Amit D; Uyei, Jennifer; Karabis, Andreas; Bash, Lori D; Brull, Sorin J","journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of rNMB","rNMB incidence","sugammadex administration","neostigmine administration","patients","post administration","occurrence of rNMB","Residual NMB incidence","deep block","moderate block","deep neuromuscular block","residual neuromuscular block","depth of block","antagonist sugammadex","RCTs","combinations of rocuronium","combinations of NMBAs","reversing NMB","reverse rocuronium-induced NMB","combination of rocuronium","REVIEW METHODS","vecuronium","results","timepoints","OBJECTIVES Neuromuscular blocking agents","meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","systematic literature review","airway management","surgery","cisatracurium","optimal surgical conditions","Cochrane Collaboration","ubiquitous use","PRISMA group","partial recovery","field of anesthesiology","evidence","pancuronium","train","common clinical problem","TOFR","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","total"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS From February 17th to April 5th, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among them, 41 patients (39.8%) were admitted to the ICU and 29 (70.7%) required (IMV). The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49/103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI \u226535 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (aOR 5.39; 95% CI:1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05-44.82) or severe obesity (BMI\u226535 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39-71.69).

Our study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \u0026 MEASUREMENTS In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 49 hospitalized patients on maintenance hemodialysis and 52 hospitalized patients without kidney failure (controls) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 at Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed. The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020. RESULTS The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72). All patients were local residents of Wuhan. In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]). Lymphocyte counts were decreased (0.8\u00D7109/L [patients on hemodialysis] versus 0.9\u00D7109/L [controls], P=0.02). Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, P=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, P=0.03). Common complications including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and acute cardiac injury in patients on hemodialysis were significantly higher. Compared with controls, more patients on hemodialysis received noninvasive ventilation (25% versus 6%, P=0.008). As of March 19, 2020, three patients on hemodialysis (6%) were transferred to the intensive care unit and received invasive ventilation. Seven patients on hemodialysis (14%) had died. CONCLUSIONS The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, including fever and cough, were less common in patients on hemodialysis.

Our aim was to compare long-term results of percutaneous sonographically-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with high-powered microwave ablation (MWSA) in treatment of ICC. Methods: Results of 71 ICC patients with 98 nodules treated with RFA (36 patients) or MWSA (35 patients) between January 2008 and June 2018 in 5 Interventional Ultrasound centers of Southern Italy were retrospectively reviewed. Cumulative overall survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and differences with the log-rank test. Eleven possible factors affecting survival were analyzed. Results: Overall survival of the entire series was 88%, 65%, 45% and 34% at 12, 36, 60 and 80 months, respectively. Patients treated with MWSA survived longer than patients treated with RFA (p \u003C 0.005). The MWSA group with ICC nodules \u22643 cm or nodules up to 4 cm survived longer than the RFA group (p \u003C 0.0005). In patients with nodules \u003E4 cm, no significant difference was found. Disease-free survival and progression-free survival were better in the MWSA group compared to the RFA group (p \u003C 0.005). Diameter of nodules and MWSA were independent factors predicting a better survival. No major complications were observed. Conclusions: MWSA is superior to RFA in treating ICC unfit for surgery, achieving better long-term survival in small (\u22643 cm) ICC nodules as well as nodules up to 4 cm of neoplastic tumors and should replace RFA.","publish_time":"2019-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giorgio, Antonio; Gatti, Pietro; Montesarchio, Luca; Santoro, Bruno; Dell\u0027Olio, Andrea; Crucinio, Nicola; Coppola, Carmine; Scarano, Ferdinando; Biase, Fabio De; Cirac\u00EC, Emanuela; Semeraro, Stefano; Giorgio, Valentina","journal":"Journal of clinical and translational hepatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.14218/jcth.2019.00036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31915596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFA","MWSA","Interventional Ultrasound","ICC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICC nodules","ICC patients","RFA group","MWSA group","better survival","treatment of ICC","Disease-free survival","better long-term survival","Diameter of nodules","progression-free survival","Cumulative overall survival curves","percutaneous thermal ablation","alternative treatment","treatment of choice","surgery","long-term results of percutaneous sonographically-guided radiofrequency ablation","high-powered microwave ablation","independent factors","possible factors","differences","intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","Kaplan-Meyer method","Interventional Ultrasound centers of Southern Italy","log-rank test","entire series","resection","Conclusions","Methods","neoplastic tumors","aim","significant difference","major complications","Background","months"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated the safety, humoral response and viral shedding in horses inoculated with a commercially available modified-live bovine coronavirus (BCoV) vaccine. Twelve healthy adult horses were vaccinated twice, 3 weeks apart, either orally, intranasally or intrarectally. Two healthy unvaccinated horses served as sentinel controls. Following each vaccine administration, horses were monitored daily for physical abnormalities whilst the onset and duration of BCoV shedding was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in nasal secretions and faeces. Whole blood was collected every 3 weeks to determine BCoV-specific antibody response. With the exception of transient and self-limiting changes in faecal character observed in seven vaccinated and one control horse, no additional abnormal clinical findings were found in the study horses. Following the first and second vaccine administration, two and one horse, respectively, tested qPCR-positive for BCoV in nasal secretions 1-day post intranasal vaccination. No vaccinated horses tested qPCR-positive for BCoV in faeces following each vaccine administration. One of the two horses that shed BCoV seroconverted to BCoV after the first vaccine administration and an additional two vaccinated horses (oral and intrarectal) seroconverted to BCoV after the second vaccine administration.

However, the methodology for PIIC preoperative risk assessment remains unestablished. We aimed to develop a preoperative risk model for postgastrectomy PIIC. METHODS We collected 183,936 patients\u0027 data on distal or total gastrectomy performed in 2013-2016 for gastric cancer from the Japanese National Clinical Database and divided into development (2013-2015; n = 140,558) and validation (2016; n = 43,378) cohort. The primary outcome was the incidence of PIIC. The risk model for PIIC was developed using 18 preoperative factors: age, sex, body mass index, activities of daily living, 12 comorbidity types, gastric cancer stage, and surgical procedure in the development cohort. Secondarily, we developed another model based on the new scoring system for clinical use using selected factors. RESULTS The overall incidence of PIIC was 4.7%, including 2.6%, 1.7%, and 1.3% in anastomotic leakage, pancreatic fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess, respectively. Among the 18 preoperative factors, male [odds ratio, (OR) 1.92], obesity (OR, 1.52-1.96), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 1.55), steroid use (OR, 1.83), and total gastrectomy (OR, 1.89) strongly correlated with PIIC incidence. The entire model using the 18 factors had good discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort. We selected eight relevant factors to create a simple scoring system, using which we categorized the patients into three risk groups, which showed good calibration.

The study objective was to assess the safety and clinical outcomes of robotic mitral valve surgery in the first 100 cases performed in our center. METHODS We reviewed the first 100 patients who underwent robotic primary mitral valve repair, including concomitant procedures, from April 2018 to August 2019. The cause of mitral valve disease was degenerative (n = 94), endocarditis (n = 2), functional (n = 2), and other (n = 2). RESULTS There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Mitral valve repair was completed in all patients. Only one patient required conversion to full sternotomy due to left ventricular apex bleeding. In echocardiography performed before hospital discharge, the mitral regurgitation was graded as none or trivial in 94 patients (94%) and mild in 4 (4%). Only two patients required surgical re-intervention due to postoperative hemolysis with moderate mitral regurgitation. For patients who underwent the mitral valve procedure alone, the median times of the total operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping, and console usage were 185, 112, 71, and 60 min, respectively. The learning curve showed that the operation time decreased slightly during the first ten cases and then plateaued at a mean of approximately 180 min. CONCLUSIONS Robotically assisted mitral valve repair was feasible, safe, and therapeutically effective in the first 100 cases, with a minimal learning curve. The robotically assisted approach provides a high-quality surgical view and tremorless suture/cut handling, which will contribute to further development of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakuta, Takashi; Fukushima, Satsuki; Shimahara, Yusuke; Yajima, Shin; Tadokoro, Naoki; Minami, Kimito; Kobayashi, Junjiro; Fujita, Tomoyuki","journal":"General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-020-01317-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32072433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["mitral valve procedure","invasive mitral valve surgery","robotic primary mitral valve repair","cause of mitral valve disease","patients","moderate mitral regurgitation","clinical outcomes of robotic mitral valve surgery","cases","assisted approach","minimal learning curve","total operation","operation time","hospital discharge","study objective","high-quality surgical view","surgical re-intervention","postoperative hemolysis","aortic clamping","cardiopulmonary bypass","safety","median times","sternotomy","tremorless suture","concomitant procedures","development","CONCLUSIONS","console usage","ventricular apex bleeding","handling","conversion","day mortality","echocardiography","mean","Japan","endocarditis","RESULTS","center","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

While frameworks for developing guidelines express the need for those potentially affected by guideline recommendations to be involved in their development, there is a lack of consensus on how this should be done in practice. Further, there is a lack of guidance on how to equitably and meaningfully engage multiple stakeholders. We aim to develop guidance for the meaningful and equitable engagement of multiple stakeholders in guideline development and implementation. METHODS This will be a multi-stage project. The first stage is to conduct a series of four systematic reviews. These will (1) describe existing guidance and methods for stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation, (2) characterize barriers and facilitators to stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation, (3) explore the impact of stakeholder engagement on guideline development and implementation, and (4) identify issues related to conflicts of interest when engaging multiple stakeholders in guideline development and implementation. DISCUSSION We will collaborate with our multiple and diverse stakeholders to develop guidance for multi-stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation. We will use the results of the systematic reviews to develop a candidate list of draft guidance recommendations and will seek broad feedback on the draft guidance via an online survey of guideline developers and external stakeholders. An invited group of representatives from all stakeholder groups will discuss the results of the survey at a consensus meeting which will inform the development of the final guidance papers. Our overall goal is to improve the development of guidelines through meaningful and equitable multi-stakeholder engagement, and subsequently to improve health outcomes and reduce inequities in health.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petkovic, Jennifer; Riddle, Alison; Akl, Elie A; Khabsa, Joanne; Lytvyn, Lyubov; Atwere, Pearl; Campbell, Pauline; Chalkidou, Kalipso; Chang, Stephanie M; Crowe, Sally; Dans, Leonila; Jardali, Fadi El; Ghersi, Davina; Graham, Ian D; Grant, Sean; Greer-Smith, Regina; Guise, Jeanne-Marie; Hazlewood, Glen; Jull, Janet; Katikireddi, S Vittal; Langlois, Etienne V; Lyddiatt, Anne; Maxwell, Lara; Morley, Richard; Mustafa, Reem A; Nonino, Francesco; Pardo, Jordi Pardo; Pollock, Alex; Pottie, Kevin; Riva, John; Sch\u00FCnemann, Holger; Simeon, Rosiane; Smith, Maureen; Stein, Airton T; Synnot, Anneliese; Tufte, Janice; White, Howard; Welch, Vivian; Concannon, Thomas W; Tugwell, Peter","journal":"Systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-1272-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implementation","development of guidelines","guideline recommendations","necessary component of guideline development","impact of stakeholder engagement","BACKGROUND Stakeholder engagement","equitable multi-stakeholder engagement","equitable engagement of multiple stakeholders","lack of guidance","stakeholder groups","existing guidance","online survey of guideline developers","external stakeholders","diverse stakeholders","final guidance papers","candidate list of draft guidance recommendations","METHODS","multi-stage project","systematic reviews","results","lack of consensus","health outcomes","consensus meeting","broad feedback","facilitators","barriers","invited group of representatives","inequities","series","need","conflicts","frameworks","overall goal","issues","DISCUSSION","practice"],"language":"en"},

ADAMTS1, the most fully characterized ADAMTS, plays conflicting roles in different cancer types; however, the role of ADAMTS1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. Herein, we found that ADAMTS1 is highly expressed in RCC tissues compared to normal renal tissues, and its expression was correlated with an advanced stage and a poor prognosis of RCC patients. In vitro, we observed higher expression of ADAMTS1 in metastatic (m)RCC cells compared to primary cells, and manipulation of ADAMTS1 expression affected cell invasion and clonogenicity. Results from protease array showed that ADAMTS1 is modulated by melatonin through mechanisms independent of the MT1 receptor in mRCC cells, and overexpression of ADAMTS1 relieved the invasion/clonogenicity and growth/metastasis inhibition imposed by melatonin treatment in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model. The human microRNA (miR) OneArray showed that miR-181d and miR-let-7f were induced by melatonin and respectively targeted the 3\u0027-UTR and non-3\u0027UTR of ADAMTS1 to suppress its expression and mRCC invasive ability. Clinically, RCC patients with high levels of miR-181d or miR-let-7f and a low level of ADAMTS1 had the most favorable prognoses. In addition, ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of ADAMTS1 can also be triggered by melatonin. Together, our study indicates that ADAMTS1 may be a useful biomarker for predicting RCC progression. The novel convergence between melatonin and ADAMTS1 post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation provides new insights into the role of melatonin-induced molecular regulation in suppressing RCC progression.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Yu-Ching; Lin, Yung-Wei; Chu, Chih-Ying; Yang, Yi-Chieh; Yang, Shun-Fa; Liu, Yu-Fan; Hsiao, Michael; Lee, Wei-Jiunn; Chien, Ming-Hsien","journal":"Journal of pineal research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of ADAMTS1","UTR of ADAMTS1","overexpression of ADAMTS1","manipulation of ADAMTS1 expression","higher expression of ADAMTS1","ADAMTS1 post-transcriptional","low level of ADAMTS1","RCC tissues","RCC progression","role of melatonin","proteasome-mediated degradation of ADAMTS1","melatonin treatment","poor prognosis of RCC patients","mRCC cells","high levels of miR","cell invasion","primary cells","clonogenicity","post-translational regulation","renal cell carcinoma","normal renal tissues","molecular regulation","cancer development","characterized ADAMTS","different cancer types","mRCC invasive ability","new insights","conflicting roles","MT1 receptor","metastasis inhibition","thrombospondin motifs","family","mechanisms independent","growth","OneArray","tissue remodeling events","advanced stage","novel convergence","ubiquitin","metalloprotease","useful biomarker","disintegrin","addition","orthotopic xenograft model","human microRNA","Results","protease array","favorable prognoses","study"],"language":"en"},

The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chieffo, Alaide; Stefanini, Giulio G; Price, Susanna; Barbato, Emanuele; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Karam, Nicole; Moreno, Ra\u00FAl; Buchanan, Gill Louise; Gilard, Martine; Halvorsen, Sigrun; Huber, Kurt; James, Stefan; Neumann, Franz-Josef; M\u00F6llmann, Helge; Roffi, Marco; Tavazzi, Guido; Ferr\u00E9, Josepa Mauri; Windecker, Stephan; Dudek, Dariusz; Baumbach, Andreas","journal":"EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4244/eijy20m05_01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions","Acute Cardiovascular Care Association","ACS"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Acute Cardiovascular Care Association","standard care","number of patients","intensive care treatment","acute cardiac care specialists","management algorithms","emergency interventions","treatment algorithms","healthcare workers","suspected COVID","unprecedented challenge","pandemic","infection","invasive management of acute coronary syndrome","European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions","hospital reorganization of emergency rooms","protection of healthcare providers","non-ST-segment elevation ACS","cardiac units","re-organization of ACS networks","hospital admission","invasive procedures","coronavirus disease","panel of interventional cardiologists","multiple European countries","reorganization of catheterization laboratories","examples","EAPCI","health systems","need","measures","risk","ACVC","conditions","redistribution of hub","evidence-based protocols","life","context","worst affected areas","experience","Various clinical scenarios","guidance","Modified diagnostic","hospitals","position statements","transmission","addition","end"],"language":"en"},

We report our experience with protocols and methods to standardize these visits to maximize the benefit and efficiency of the virtual orthopaedic examination. At the time of scheduling, patients are asked to prepare for their virtual visit and are given a checklist. In addition to confirming audiovisual capabilities prior to the visit, patients are given specific instructions on camera positioning, body positioning, setting, and attire to improve the efficiency of the visit. During the examination, digital tools can be utilized as needed. In the setting of outpatient injury evaluations, a systematic virtual examination can aid in triaging and managing common musculoskeletal conditions. With the rapid incorporation of telehealth visits, as well as the unknown future with regard to the pandemic, the utilization and capabilities of telemedicine will continue to expand.

Although elective surgical procedures are being cancelled in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, acute craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma will continue to occur and will need to be appropriately managed. Surgical procedures involving the nasal, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa carry a high risk of transmission due to aerosolization of the virus which is known to be in high concentration in these areas. Intraoperative exposure to high viral loads through aerosolization carries a very high risk of transmission, and the severity of the disease contracted in this manner is worse than that transmitted through regular community transmission. This places surgeons operating in the CMF region at particularly high risk during the pandemic. There is currently a paucity of information to delineate the best practice for the management of acute CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a clear protocol describing optimal screening, timing of intervention and choice of personal protective equipment, is needed. The authors have proposed an algorithm for management of CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that urgent and emergent CMF injuries are addressed appropriately while optimizing the safety of surgeons and other healthcare providers. The algorithm is based on available evidence at the time of writing. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and more evidence and better testing becomes available, the algorithm should be modified accordingly.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeSerres, Joshua J; Al-Shaqsi, Sultan Z; Antonyshyn, Oleh M; Fialkov, Jeffrey A","journal":"The Journal of craniofacial surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000006654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","pandemic","high risk of transmission","management of CMF trauma","management of acute CMF trauma","CMF region","high concentration","algorithm","Coronavirus disease","high viral loads","emergent CMF injuries","aerosolization","available evidence","infectious disease","regular community transmission","elective surgical procedures","acute craniomaxillofacial","safety of surgeons","places surgeons","severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus","timing of intervention","optimal screening","pharyngeal mucosa","clear protocol","nasal","best practice","choice of personal protective equipment","Intraoperative exposure","better testing","healthcare providers","time of writing","parts","world","severity","paucity of information","manner","areas","authors"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, the number of cases increased exponentially until a lockdown was implemented to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, Germany has a high capability for coronavirus lab testing and more than 30,000 ICU beds. These capabilities and the lockdown turned out to be an advantage to combat the pandemic and to prevent a health-system overload. AIM The aim was to predict the plateau day of SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths. RESULTS The effect on the viral spread of the German measures taken and the impact on the peak of new infection cases is shown. By normalizing daily case numbers, the plateau day of the current outbreak in Germany could be calculated to be reached at April 12, 2020 (day 103 of 2020). CONCLUSION Normalized case number curves are helpful to predict the time point at which no further new infections will occur. Upon reaching the plateau day during a lockdown phase, a residual time-period of about 2-3 weeks can be utilized to prepare a safe unlocking period. As can be learned from Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan there must be strict rules to keep the risk of infection low. Those include social distancing, face mask wearing in combination with digital contact tracing and serosurveillance studies. Following those rules, a safe dance around the infection curve allows to keep the population at a reduced infection rate.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, F; Krieger, V; Hufert, F T; K\u00FCpper, J-H","journal":"Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3233/ch-209004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Germany","South Korea","Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["plateau day of SARS","lockdown phase","infection curve","pandemic Germany","peak of new infection cases","reduced infection rate","risk of infection low","spread of SARS","new infections","number of cases","aim","residual time-period","safe unlocking period","early phase","time point","viral spread","German measures","strict rules","safe dance","CONCLUSION Normalized case number curves","daily case numbers","efficient containment measures","combination","digital contact tracing","face mask","coronavirus lab testing","Taiwan","high capability","population","impact","South Korea","serosurveillance studies","COVID","current outbreak","Asian countries","social distancing","ICU beds","health-system overload","effect","BACKGROUND","deaths","advantage","weeks","capabilities"],"language":"en"},

Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course. In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases. Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels \u2265 140 mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay. Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P \u003C 0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P \u003C 0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P \u003C 0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P \u003C 0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marfella, Raffaele; Paolisso, Pasquale; Sardu, Celestino; Bergamaschi, Luca; D\u2019Angelo, Emanuela Concetta; Barbieri, Michelangela; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Messina, Vincenzo; Maggi, Paolo; Coppola, Nicola; Pizzi, Carmine; Biffi, Mauro; Viale, Pierluigi; Gali\u00E9, Nazzareno; Paolisso, Giuseppe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0c040179aeccbb845778952ddb9132d982cd7e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620300823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620300823?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli","TCZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyperglycaemic patients","vs patients","positive patients","hyperglycaemic vs normoglycaemic patients","outcomes of diabetes patients","non-diabetic patients","effects of TCZ","TCZ administration","higher IL","optimal Covid","severe Covid","plasma levels","ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects","blood glucose levels","risk of severe outcomes","admission","Cox regression model","infectious disease departments","risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis","University of Bologna","infectious diseases","glucose homoeostasis","University Vanvitelli of Napoli","optimal control of glycaemia","adverse disease course","San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital","loss of significance","infection management","Italy","receptors","pneumonia","interleukin","hyperglycaemia","therapy","patient subset","evidence","cytokine release","fact","Abstract Tocilizumab","spite","note","data"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we performed a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from ten patients in Shaoxing, a mid-sized city outside of the epicenter Hubei province, China, during the early stage of the outbreak (late January to early February, 2020). We obtained viral genomes with \u003E 99% coverage and a mean depth of 296X demonstrating that viral genomic analysis is feasible via metagenomics sequencing directly on nasopharyngeal samples with SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Ct values less than 28. We found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to Hubei shared the exact same virus with patients from Wuhan, Taiwan, Belgium and Australia, highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe. The virus from another cluster of husband and wife without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak. We also found 70% patients in this study had the S genotype, consistent with an early study showing a higher prevalence of S genotype out of Hubei than that inside Hubei. We calculated an average mutation rate of 1.37x10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year, which is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Our findings add to the growing knowledge of the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that are important for guiding outbreak containment and vaccine development. The moderate mutation rate of this virus also lends hope that development of an effective, long-lasting vaccine may be possible.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jinkun; Hilt, Evann; Wu, Huan; Jiang, ZhuoJing; Zhang, QinChao; Wang, JiLing; Wang, Yifang; Li, Fan; Li, Ziqin; Tang, JiaLiang; Yang, Shangxin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20058560v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Belgium","Australia"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","patients","genomic analysis of SARS","early study","genomic characteristics of SARS","viral genomic analysis","epicenter Hubei province","travel history","vaccine development","early stage","viral genomes","average mutation rate","guiding outbreak containment","SNPs vs average","moderate mutation rate","novel coronavirus","higher prevalence of S genotype","long-lasting vaccine","cluster of husband","mid-sized city","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","metagenomics sequencing","37x10","Wuhan","nasopharyngeal samples","site","sick contact","China","Taiwan","Shaoxing","confirmed case","growing knowledge","Real-time PCR Ct values","year","nucleotide substitution","Australia","Belgium","coverage","wife","hope","mutations","mean depth","ongoing COVID","dynamic nature","cause","pandemic","findings","coronaviruses","globe"],"language":"en"},

A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794--22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526--265,113], respectively.

We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In particular, transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization respectively prevented 33,719 and 90,072 people from getting infected in the nine-day time period right after its implementation.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hongzhe; Zhao, Xiaohang; Yin, Kexin; Yan, Yiren; Qian, Wei; Chen, Bintong; Fang, Xiao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5a9b7001b506c4c7acceb2810ec2fe1cfa70c0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["true number of infections","Wuhan lockdown","epidemiological parameters","true numbers of infections","static estimate","effective reproduction number","spread of COVID","outbreak sizes","method","key challenge","common approach","exported cases","day-to-day official numbers","large scale hospitalization","transportation suspension","major government interventions","day time period","implementation","effects","comprehensive retrospection","maximum","disease","discrepancy","people","city"],"language":"en"},

Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis. Conclusions: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levin, M.; Chen, M.

Lack of universal testing and death underreporting make between-country comparisons difficult. The country-level determinants of COVID-19 mortality are unknown. Objective: Derive a measure of COVID-related death rates that is comparable across countries and identify its country-level predictors. Methods: An ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting \u003E25 COVID-related deaths until May 1, 2020 were included. The outcome was the mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential predictors assessed were most recently published Demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita; environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-April)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health systems parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population and international arrivals). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data. Results: Thirty-one countries were included. Of all country-level predictors included in the multivariable model, only total number of international arrivals was significantly associated with the mean death rate: Beta 0.3798 (95% Confidence Interval 0.2414, 0.5182), P \u003C0.001. Conclusion: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Stopping international travel, particularly from affected areas, may be the most effective strategy to control COVID outbreak and prevent related deaths.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pana, T.

Customarily, this feature has been treated somewhat superficially in phylogenetic analyses, often as a single \u0027defining\u0027 character of a chondrichthyan clade. TCC is actually a complex hard tissue with numerous distinctive attributes, but its utility as a character complex for phylogenetic analysis has not yet been optimized. In this paper, we attempt to improve this situation by presenting new terminology for certain aspects of tesseral architecture, including single-monolayered, multiple-monolayered, polylayered and voussoir tesserae; new histological data, including thin sections of TCC in several Paleozoic taxa; and new proposals for ways in which various characters and states (many of which are defined here for the first time) could be applied in future phylogenetic analyses of chondrichthyan fishes. We conclude that many, but not all of the unique attributes of modern TCC were evolved by the Early Devonian (ca 400 MY). The globular calcified cartilage reported in Silurian sinacanthids, and the so-called \u0027sub-tessellated\u0027 perichondral biomineralization (with irregular and ill-defined geometries of a layer or layers of calcified cartilage blocks) of certain extinct \u0027acanthodians\u0027 (e.g., Climatius, Ischnacanthus, Cheiracanthus) could represent evolutionary precursors of TCC, which seems to characterize only part of the chondrichthyan total group. We hypothesize that heavily biomineralized \u0027layer-cake\u0027 TCC in certain Paleozoic chondrichthyans perhaps served a dual physiological role, as a phosphate sink and in providing increased skeletal density in very large (7\u002B m) Devonian-Permian marine sharks such as ctenacanths, and as an adaptation to calcium-deficient environments among Permo-Carboniferous non-marine sharks such as xenacanths. By contrast, the equivalent tissue in modern elasmobranchs probably serves only to reinforce regions of cartilage (mostly in the jaws) subjected to high loading. We also note that much of the variation observed in tesseral architecture (including localized remodeling), ultrastructure and histology in modern and extinct chondrichthyans is confined to the perichondrally-facing cap zone (where Type-1 collagen matrix predominates in modern TCC), whereas the main body of the tessera (where Type-2 collagen matrix predominates) exhibits comparatively little evidence of remodeling and histological or structural variation.

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, Dan; Huang, Ying; Mart\u00EDn-de-Carpi, Javier; Aloi, Marina; Focht, Gili; Kang, Ben; Zhou, Ying; Sanchez, Cesar; Kappelman, Michael D; Uhlig, Holm H; Pujol-Muncunill, Gemma; Ledder, Oren; Lionetti, Paolo; Dias, Jorge Amil; Ruemmele, Frank M; Russell, Richard K","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD","Porto","PIBD"],"locations":["South Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["PIBD children","PIBD patients","current IBD treatment","PIBD authors","current practice of PIBD treatment","paediatric IBD","major PIBD centres","severe IBD course","Standard IBD treatments","pandemic","Porto group members","biologic treatment","era of COVID","guidance points","China","South-Korea","South Korea","electronic reporting system of children","provisional guidance","biologics","group of ESPGHAN","survey","milder SARS-CoV","current coronavirus disease","mild infection","hand","face-to-face appointments","risk","epidemic areas","inflammatory bowel diseases","clinicians","CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data","METHODS","hospitalization","global experience","INTRODUCTION","present","immunomodulators","concerns","management","outbreak","RESULTS","consensus rate","remote consultations","cases","exacerbation"],"language":"en"},

Similar decision limits for septic pneumonia are recommended for dogs but have not yet been evaluated for other organ systems. The aim of the retrospective study was to investigate the prevalence and evaluate dogs with CRP concentrations \u003E 100 mg/l regarding the underlying etiology, the affected organ system and the prognostic significance. RESULTS Prevalence of CRP \u003E 100 mg/l was investigated in dogs presented between 2014 and 2015 and was 12%. For evaluation of etiology and organ systems, dogs with CRP \u003E 100 mg/l presented between 2014 and 2016 were enrolled. Dogs were classified into 4 main disease categories, i.e. inflammatory, neoplastic, tissue damage or \u0022diverse\u0022. Diseases were assigned to the affected organ system. If an organ classification was not possible, dogs were classified as \u0022multiple\u0022. 147 dogs with CRP 101-368 mg/l were included and classified into disease categories: 86/147 (59%) with inflammatory etiology (among these, 23/86 non-infectious, 44/86 infectious (33/44 bacterial), 19/86 inflammation non-classifiable), 31/147 (21%) tissue damage, 17/147 (12%) neoplastic (all malignant) and 13/147 (9%) diverse diseases. The affected organ systems included 57/147 (39%) multiple, 30/147 (20%) trauma, 21/147 (14%) gastrointestinal tract, 10/147 (7%) musculoskeletal system, 8/147 (5%) respiratory tract, 7/147 (5%) urinary/reproductive tract, 6/147 (4%) skin/subcutis/ear, 6/147 (4%) central/peripheral nervous system and 2/147 (1%) heart. The disease group (p = 0.081) or organ system (p = 0.17) did not have an impact on CRP. Based on CRP, a detection of bacterial infection was not possible. The prognostic significance was investigated by determining the 3-months survival and hospitalization rate in a subgroup with known outcome. The 3-months survival rate was 46/73 (63%) while the majority 66/73 (90%) of patients was hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS CRP concentrations \u003E 100 mg/l are occasionally seen in a clinic population. They indicate a severe systemic disease of various etiologies with guarded prognosis. Extremely high CRP concentrations do not allow a conclusion of the underlying etiology or an identification of bacterial inflammation.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hindenberg, Sarah; Bauer, Natali; Moritz, Andreas","journal":"BMC veterinary research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02367-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dogs","high CRP concentrations","CONCLUSIONS CRP concentrations","affected organ systems","organ classification","RESULTS Prevalence of CRP","underlying etiology","inflammatory etiology","musculoskeletal system","evaluation of etiology","disease group","detection of bacterial infection","indicators of bacterial infection","identification of bacterial inflammation","main disease categories","peripheral nervous system","months survival rate","tissue damage","prognostic significance","diverse diseases","reproductive tract","gastrointestinal tract","respiratory tract","multiple","severe systemic disease of various etiologies","hospitalization rate","C-reactive protein","subgroup","septic pneumonia","guarded prognosis","human medicine","Similar decision limits","need of antibiotic treatment","known outcome","retrospective study","BACKGROUND","skin","subcutis","aim","clinic population","impact","trauma","heart","majority","patients"],"language":"en"},

Corresponding median CRP was 193 mg/L, 7.9 mg/L (P \u003C0.0001) and \u003C6 mg/L (P 0.0001). Radiological improvement was noted in 44% of patients by Day 7 and 68% by Day 14. Nine patients (36%) were discharged alive from ICU and three (12%) died. The proportion of patients on invasive ventilation declined from (84%) at the time of tocilizumab initiation to 60% on Day 7 (P 0.031) and 28% on Day 14 (P 0.001). The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event. However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy. CONCLUSION In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements. Given the study\u0027s limitations, the results require assessment in adequately powered randomized controlled trials. This article is protected by copyright.

Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses, however viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality. Here we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. MATERIALS AND METHODS Stock SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units. Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells. A total of five (n=5) plasma and three (n=3) platelet products were evaluated in this study. RESULTS In both experiments the measured titer of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The mean log reductions in the viral titers were \u22653.40 and \u22654.53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively. CONCLUSION Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keil, Shawn D; Ragan, Izabela; Yonemura, Susan; Hartson, Lindsay; Dart, Nicole K; Bowen, Richard","journal":"Vox sanguinis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UV light","transmitted SARS-CoV","plasma units","platelet units","pandemic virus SARS-CoV","METHODS Stock SARS-CoV","measured titer of SARS","infectious titers of SARS","efficacy of riboflavin","CONCLUSION Riboflavin","platelet products","platelets units","coronavirus family","Coronavirus infections","blood safety","limit of detection","viral titers","Vero cells","causative agent of coronavirus disease","blood product quality","OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus","respiratory illnesses","viral RNA","theoretical risk of transfusion","potential low-risk threat","PRT","System","Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology","BACKGROUND","pathogens noninfectious","treatment","serum","mean log reductions","humans","MATERIALS","plaque assay","COVID","tissue culture","process","infected patients","RESULTS","member","study","data","Coronaviruses","total"],"language":"en"},

Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu TM database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau ( \u03C4) using the formula t= \u03C4/2 u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Wen-Bin; Tang, Guang-Da; Zhang, Li; Corlett, Richard T","journal":"Zoological research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","human transmissions of SARS","complete genomes of SARS","date of population expansion","viral genomes","ancestral haplotypes","haplotypes H13","recent expansion","early expansion","non-synonymous substitutions","specific directions of human","potential population size changes","outside China","expansion parameter tau","study","potential sources","bat-RaTG13","virus adaptation","outbreak of COVID","international infected cases","reported bat coronavirus genome","evolution","phylogenomic analyses","GISAID EpiFlu TM database","later H1","codons","H38","outgroup","phyloepidemiologic approaches","formula t","substitution sites","intermediate haplotype H3","total","samples","coding-regions","HCoV","Wuhan","people","world","nCoV","months","combinations","groups"],"language":"en"},

Perfluorobutane-contrast enhanced US (pCEUS) is a promising tool that may allow for targeting of tumours that are otherwise imperceptible on greyscale US. Although pCEUS has been reported to be effective, the literature has been limited outside of Japan and South Korea. We aimed to provide data that supports the use of pCEUS in thermal ablation of sonographically occult liver tumours. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of 35 consecutive patients who underwent pCEUS-guided ablation of 48 liver tumours with a median size of 1.2 cm. Periprocedural, one-month post-treatment, and relevant follow-up imaging studies were reviewed. Electronic records were also obtained, with long-term follow-up data of 12-28 months being available for 32 patients. RESULTS 36 (75%) of tumours that were imperceptible on greyscale US became visible with pCEUS. Overall, complete tumour ablation at one month was 89%. 1 (3%) patient developed a major complication following treatment, while 6 (17%) had minor post-treatment complaints. The local tumour progression rate was 17% with a median time of 14 months. CONCLUSION pCEUS has a role in US-guided thermal ablation of liver tumours, offering a high technical success rate that is comparable to reported data. Additional benefits may include improved procedural time and freedom from ionising radiation.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Haiyuan; Ong, Yi-Ting; Gogna, Apoorva; Venkatanarasimha, Nanda; Sanamandra, Sarat Kumar; Leong, Sum; Irani, Farah Gillan; Lo, Richard Hoau Gong; Too, Chow Wei","journal":"Singapore medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["pCEUS-guided ablation","thermal ablation of liver tumours","treatment of small liver tumours","use of pCEUS","greyscale US","CONCLUSION pCEUS","thermal ablation of sonographically occult liver tumours","complete tumour ablation","month post-treatment","treatment complaints","median time","Perfluorobutane-contrast enhanced US","long-term follow-up data","months","consecutive patients","median size","local tumour progression rate","improved procedural time","high technical success rate","relevant follow-up imaging studies","freedom","Periprocedural","retrospective single-centre study","role","ionising radiation","Additional benefits","Japan","major complication","INTRODUCTION Image","ultrasonography","promising tool","South Korea","literature","METHODS","Electronic records","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bachelet, Vivienne C","journal":"Medwave","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.03.7891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PubMed/MEDLINE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Diagnostic testing","current testing","laboratory diagnostic tests","current diagnostic methods","clinical utility","testing community","suspect cases","search strategies","detection","COVID","quick search","health outcomes","MEDLINE","proportion of false negatives","studies","epidemiological surveillance","rapid viral diagnosis","specificity","sensitivity","impact","pandemic","proper knowledge","SARS-CoV","disease","large parts","accuracy","death","PubMed","test characteristics","review","world","battle","eligible articles","population","national efforts","limitations","papers"],"language":"en"},

Containment measures were approved soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the Veneto region, Italy. METHODS A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the actual outbreak behaviour. RESULTS The comparison between the observed and predicted hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19 hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78 hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81). CONCLUSIONS The containment strategies seem to have positively impacted the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Veneto.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gregori, Dario; Azzolina, Danila; Lanera, Corrado; Prosepe, Ilaria; Destro, Nicolas; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Berchialla, Paola","journal":"Journal of epidemiology and community health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Veneto"],"locations":["Veneto"],"keyphrases":["epidemic outbreak","epidemic growth","epidemic speed","outbreak progression","onset of containment measures","epidemic curve","containment strategies","total COVID","Veneto region","weeks","actual outbreak behaviour","BACKGROUND Veneto","detected changepoint","expected number of hospitalisations","generalised additive model","Bayesian changepoint analysis","piecewise polynomial model","estimated daily slowdown effect","quadratic growth","changing speed","predicted hospitalisation curves","projection","comparison","period","METHODS","GAM","look","Italy","Italian regions","impact","data","CONCLUSIONS","present study","time interval","estimates","day","CI"],"language":"en"},

However, it was not investigated among patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to investigate the impact of CRP/albumin ratio on intra-hospital mortality in patients with ICH. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on 379 ICH patients admitted between 02/2008 and 12/2017. Blood samples were drawn upon admission and the patients\u0027 demographic, medical, and radiological data were collected. The identification of the independent prognostic factors for intra-hospital mortality was calculated using binary logistic regression and COX regression analysis. RESULTS Multivariate regression analysis shows that higher CRP/albumin ratio (odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.193-2.317, p = 0.003) upon admission is an independent predictor of intra-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that an increase of 1 in the CRP/albumin ratio was associated with a 15.3% increase in the risk of intra-hospital mortality (hazard ratio = 1.153, 95% CI = 1.005-1.322, p = 0.42). Furthermore, a CRP/albumin ratio cut-off value greater than 1.22 was associated with increased intra-hospital mortality (Youden\u0027s Index = 0.19, sensitivity = 28.8, specificity = 89.9, p = 0.007).

METHODS We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol. The whole blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma with or without prior heat inactivation, or only the separated plasma was heat inactivated. Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 \u2103 for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol. The plasma standard and quality control samples were inactivated in an identical manner and tested with LC-MS/MS along with the treated samples. RESULTS The optimized method showed a high imprecision (with mean intra- and inter-day imprecisions of 3.59% and 2.81%, respectively) and a high accuracy (mean 97.37%) for detecting voriconazole in the inactivated samples at different concentration levels. Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%). The measured voriconazole concentrations in inactivated whole blood, inactivated plasma and the samples without inactivation all showed good linear correlations with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation at 56 \u2103 for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Boxin; Liu, Sijia; Liu, Yuan; Li, Guofeng; Zhang, Qing","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivated samples","treated samples","inactivated plasma","clinical blood samples","LC-MS","effect of heat inactivation","prior heat inactivation","CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation","quality control samples","voriconazole-treated patients","measured voriconazole concentrations","high mean recovery","ethanol sample preparation","based voriconazole concentration measurement","therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole","plasma standard","separated plasma","heparinized tubes","high imprecision","acetonitrile","minimal mean matrix effect","high accuracy","results of therapeuticdrug monitoring","different concentration levels","liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry","good linear correlations","TDM","correlation coefficients","effects","ongoing COVID","inter-day imprecisions","identical manner","optimized method","protein precipitation","surface","METHODS","pandemic","OBJECTIVE","SARS-CoV"],"language":"en"},

Methods One hundred patients aged \u003E65 years were randomly allocated into either the PEEP5 or the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) group (PEEPEIT). Each group underwent volume-controlled ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) with the PEEP either fixed at 5 cmH2O or set at an individualized EIT setting. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The secondary endpoints included the driving pressure, and dynamic respiratory system compliance (Cdyn). Other outcomes, such as the mean airway pressure (Pmean), mean arterial pressure (MAP), lung complications and the length of hospital stay were explored. Results The optimal PEEP set by EIT was significantly higher (range from 9-13 cmH2O) than the fixed PEEP. PaO2/FiO2 was 47 mmHg higher (95% CI: 7-86 mmHg; P=0.021), Cdyn was 4.3 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 2.1-6.7 cmH2O; P\u003C0.001), and the driving pressure was 3.7 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 2.2-5.1 mmH2O; P\u003C0.001) at 0.5 h during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. At 1 h during OLV, PaO2/FiO2 was 93 mmHg higher (95% CI: 58-128 mmHg; P\u003C0.001), Cdyn was 4.4 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 1.9-6.9 mL/cmH2O; P=0.001), and the driving pressure was 4.9 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 3.8-6.1 cmH2O; P\u003C0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. PaO2/FiO2 was 107 mmHg higher (95% CI: 56-158 mmHg; P\u003C0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group during double-lung ventilation at the end of surgery.

It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit (ICU) colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Hui Ching; Hughes, Thomas; Bozlu, Murat; Kad\u0131o\u011Flu, Ate\u015F; Somani, Bhaskar K","journal":"Turkish journal of urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5152/tud.2020.20119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","respiratory distress","respiratory system","Coronavirus disease","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","healthcare systems","unwell patients","infectious disease","management of COVID","Laboratory diagnosis","urologists","CT scan of patients","severe impact","urological practice","Reallocation of staff","essential services","surgical procedures","critical procedures","junior medical staff","usual scope of practice","diarrhea","education opportunities","chest XR","fever","intensive care unit","overwhelming number","nausea","training","dyspnea","cough","specialist service","ICU","extreme pressures","fatigue","myalgia","colleagues","cancellations","wards","equipment","long-term implications","oxygenation","pneumonia","symptoms","SARS-CoV","unprecedented effect","consequence","urology","Radiological changes","pandemic","challenges","emergency","guidance","ventilation","influence","outpatient face-to-face clinics"],"language":"en"},

Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population.

This virus is known to cause severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to difficulty breathing requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit management. PATIENT CONCERNS A 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented as a transfer to our hospital facility with worsening fevers, cough, and respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS Chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates worse at the lung bases and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result. INTERVENTIONS She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody. She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability. OUTCOMES She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family\u0027s wishes and passed away. LESSONS With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems. While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections. The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Douedi, Steven; Miskoff, Jeffrey","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384516/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative COVID","positive result","acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe bilateral pneumonia","intensive care unit management","comfort care","bilateral infiltrates worse","non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus","hospital facility","previous hospital","mortality rate","global pandemic","healthcare facilities","confirmed cases","healthcare systems","bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent","DIAGNOSIS Chest X-rays","global health burden","loading dose of remdesivir","growing death rate","RATIONALE Novel coronavirus","high dose intravenous ascorbic acid","hydroxychloroquine","lung bases","CT scan","worsening fevers","mechanical ventilation","cough","requirement of vasopressors","anti-interleukin","day","cure","major hit","ARDS","organ failure","additional pressure","SARS-CoV","year-old female","history of hypertension","course","vaccine trials","transfer","difficulty","medications","institution","approved medication regimen","hemodynamic stability","alarming increase","wide-range","beta-coronaviridae family","hyperlipidemia","monoclonal antibody","LESSONS","family\u0027s wishes","infections","PATIENT","companies","symptoms","testing","OUTCOMES","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes. Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls. Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management. Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garg, Satish K; Rodbard, David; Hirsch, Irl B; Forlenza, Gregory P","journal":"Diabetes technology \u0026 therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2020.0161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dexcom Clarity"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of telemedicine","management of patients","onset T1D patients","new-onset diabetes education","adult patients","management of new","ongoing diabetes education","new-onset T1D training","pediatric patient","high-risk patients","insulin dosage management","person patient education","management of type","adult subject","insulin pump","effectiveness of use","present case reports","digital medicine","pandemic","interpretive summary reports","multiple daily insulin injections","current COVID","ambulatory glucose profiles","continuous glucose monitoring","available analysis software","Glooko","Dexcom Clarity","Internet","Zoom","efficacy","efficiency","cost-effectiveness of medical care","important approaches","access","people","feasibility","effective approach","combination of e-mail","cases","telephone calls","Conclusions","incentive","day","applications","expansion","families","family","Background","Methods","aspects","Results","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Many studies revealed that laryngeal mask airway (LMA) might reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. However, little is known about the use of a flexible reinforced LMA (FLMA) in thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of FLMA compared with ETT on postoperative sore throat. METHODS In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, ninety-six patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomly divided into ETT group and FLMA group. All the included patients received total intravenous anesthesia (with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium) and controlled mechanical ventilation during the surgery. Cuff pressure of ETT and FLMA were strictly controlled. Incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, numbness and hoarseness at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Incidence and severity of buckling during extubation and the hemodynamic profile during intubation were also recorded and compared. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was significantly lower in FLMA group than those in ETT group at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, as well as the severity of sore throat. Compared to ETT group, there was a significantly lower incidence of buckling during extubation and less fluctuation of HR and BP at 1 min and 3 min after intubation in FLMA group. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing thyroid surgery with FLMA had less postoperative laryngopharyngeal symptoms when compared with ETT. The use of FLMA also achieved less buckling during extubation and better hemodynamic profiles during intubation.

We evaluated the concordance between the Roche Diagnostics cobas\u00AE 6800 SARS-CoV-2 Test and a laboratory- developed Real-Time RT-PCR test (LDT) based on a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples submitted to the Clinical Laboratories of the Mount Sinai Health System. 1006 Nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from persons under investigation were tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine clinical care using the cobas SARS-CoV2 test with subsequent evaluation by the LDT. Cycle threshold values were analyzed and interpreted as either positive (\u0027Detected\u0027 or \u0027Presumptive Positive\u0027), negative (\u0027Not Detected\u0027), inconclusive, or invalid. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. The cobas SARS-CoV2 test reported 706 positives and 300 negatives. The LDT reported 640 positives, 323 negatives, 34 inconclusive, and 9 invalids. When excluding inconclusive and invalid results, the overall percent agreement between the two platforms was 95.8%. Cohen\u0027s kappa coefficient (\u03BA) was 0.904 (95 % CI 0.875-0.933), suggesting almost perfect agreement between both platforms. An overall discordance rate of 4.2% between the two systems may reflect differences in primer sequences, assay limit of detection, or other factors, highlighting the importance of comparing the performance of different testing platforms.

This study investigated postoperative micronutrient trends in the follow-up of patients following a minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) for cancer. Patients were included if they had at least one postoperative evaluation of iron, ferritin, vitamins B1, B6, B12, D, folate or methylmalonic acid. Data were available in 83 of 95 patients. Of these, 78.3% (65/83) had at least one and 37.3% (31/83) had more than one micronutrient deficiency at a median of 6.1 months (interquartile range (IQR) 5.4-7.5) of follow-up. Similar to the results found in previous studies, most common deficiencies identified were: iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In addition, folate deficiency and anemia were detected in a substantial amount of patients in this cohort. At 24.8 months (IQR 19.4-33.1) of follow-up, micronutrient deficiencies were still common, however, most deficiencies normalized following supplementation on indication. In conclusion, patients undergoing a MIE are at risk of developing micronutrient deficiencies as early as 6 up to 24 months after surgery and should therefore be routinely checked and supplemented when needed.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janssen, Henricus J B; Fransen, Laura F C; Ponten, Jeroen E H; Nieuwenhuijzen, Grard A P; Luyer, Misha D P","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12030778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["follow-up of patients","development of micronutrient deficiencies","common deficiencies","micronutrient deficiency","risk of developing micronutrient deficiencies","months","postoperative micronutrient trends","vitamin B12","folate deficiency","MIE","IQR","postoperative evaluation of iron","following supplementation","resectable esophageal cancer","survival rates","ferritin","B6","vitamins B1","addition","median","previous studies","invasive esophagectomy","anemia","past decades","interquartile range","gastric conduit","methylmalonic acid","results","indication","study","sequelae","cohort","conclusion","Data","surgery"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS Ultimately, 164 patients were analyzed. Portal or splenic VT was significantly correlated with age \u003C 65 years old, benign tumor, laparoscopic surgery, preservation of the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and left gastric vein (LGV), preservation of the IMV only, no drainage vein, length of the residual splenic vein (RSV) \u2265 26 mm, vessel dissection with a linear stapler, and intra-abdominal abscess (all P \u003C 0.05). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis indicated that the length of the RSV (odds ratio [OR]: 9.15, P = 0.03) was an independent predictive factor for portal VT and that the length of the RSV (OR: 37.9, P \u003C 0.01), vessel dissection with a linear stapler (OR: 6.49, P = 0.03), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR: 23.0, P = 0.02) were independent predictive factors for splenic VT.

While community mental health nurses (CMHN) might be well-placed to support people with SMI in averting relapse, no systematic reviews have examined this association. AIM To review the evidence from studies reporting an association between CMHN exposure and hospitalisation of persons living with SMI (a proxy for relapse). METHODS Searches were undertaken in ten bibliographic databases and two clinical trial registries. We included studies of patients with SMI, where CMHN was the exposure, and the outcome was relapse (i.e. readmission to a psychiatric inpatient facility). Quality assessment of included studies was completed using two risk-of-bias measures. RESULTS Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were rated as being of low-moderate methodological quality. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that community mental health nursing reduced the risk of admission to psychiatric inpatient facilities. CONCLUSIONS The review found no evidence that CMHN was associated with higher or lower odds of admission to psychiatric inpatient facilities among patients with SMI. The findings of the review point to a need for further research to investigate the impact of CMHN exposure and relapse in people with SMI.

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted. The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terpos, Evangelos; Engelhardt, Monika; Cook, Gordon; Gay, Francesca; Mateos, Maria-Victoria; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; van de Donk, Niels W C J; Avet-Loiseau, Herv\u00E9; Hajek, Roman; Vangsted, Annette Juul; Ludwig, Heinz; Zweegman, Sonja; Moreau, Philippe; Einsele, Hermann; Boccadoro, Mario; San Miguel, Jesus; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Sonneveld, Pieter","journal":"Leukemia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-020-0876-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Myeloma Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standard risk patients","frail patients","standard risk relapsed patients","severe COVID","international COVID","symptomatic COVID","anti-myeloma treatment","patient risk","standard risk disease","treatment individualization","myeloma emergencies","delay of treatment","early diagnosis of COVID","increased risk","Treatment initiation","multiple myeloma","new treatment line","European Myeloma Network","myeloma-related events","order","SARS-CoV","response","positive PCR test","continuous surveillance","PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab","aggressive relapses","Patient education","Oral agent-based regimens","extended induction","de-intensified regimens","slow biochemical relapses","low tumor burden","social distancing measures","dexamethasone","bortezomib","personal hygiene","expert consensus statement","ASCT","cell apheresis","telemedicine","end organ damage","immunocompromised state","associated complications","appropriate adaptations","therapeutic decisions","hospital admission","older age","transplantation","ward","drug interactions","daratumumab","carfilzomib","local communities","cancer registries","conduction of clinical trials","current circumstances","comorbidities","community","need","polypharmacy","participation","countries","recovery","Watchful waiting","infections","day quarantine","pandemic","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

This systematic review examines the current state of evidence for ketamine use in children with treatment-resistant mood disorders. We conducted a search utilizing two electronic databases for English-language studies investigating the therapeutic effects and side effect profile of ketamine in youth \u2264 19 years of age with a diagnosis of a treatment-resistant mood disorder. Analysis included subjects with treatment-resistant depression with and without psychotic features and with bipolar disorder. Primary outcome measures included the following scales: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Children\u0027s Depression Rating Scale, Children\u0027s Depression Rating Scale Revised, Child Bipolar Questionnaire, Overt Aggression Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Four published studies were identified that investigated therapeutic ketamine use in youth for the primary purpose of treating a treatment-resistant psychiatric disorder. Three additional studies that did not meet eligibility criteria were identified and discussed.

{"cord_uid":"on3h9f9f","sha":null,"source_x":"Medline","title":"Usefulness of Parasternal Intercostal Muscle Ultrasound during Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation.","doi":"10.1097/aln.0000000000003191","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32084029","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND The assessment of diaphragm function with diaphragm ultrasound seems to bring important clinical information to describe diaphragm work and weakness. When the diaphragm is weak, extradiaphragmatic muscles may play an important role, but whether ultrasound can also assess their activity and function is unknown. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility of measuring the thickening of the parasternal intercostal and investigate the responsiveness of this muscle to assisted ventilation; and (2) evaluate whether a combined evaluation of the parasternal and the diaphragm could predict failure of a spontaneous breathing trial. METHODS First, an exploratory evaluation of the parasternal in 23 healthy subjects. Second, the responsiveness of parasternal to several pressure support levels were studied in 16 patients. Last, parasternal activity was compared in presence or absence of diaphragm dysfunction (assessed by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and ultrasound) and in case of success/failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in 54 patients. RESULTS The parasternal was easily accessible in all patients. The interobserver reproducibility was good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89). There was a progressive decrease in parasternal muscle thickening fraction with increasing levels of pressure support (Spearman \u03C1 = -0.61 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.44]; P \u003C 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between parasternal muscle thickening fraction and the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm (Spearman \u03C1 = -0.79 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.66]; P \u003C 0.0001). The parasternal muscle thickening fraction was higher in patients with diaphragm dysfunction: 17% (10 to 25) versus 5% (3 to 8), P \u003C 0.0001. The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm thickening fraction and the parasternal thickening fraction similarly predicted failure or the spontaneous breathing trial. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound assessment of the parasternal intercostal muscle is feasible in the intensive care unit and provides novel information regarding the respiratory capacity load balance. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Ultrasound can be used to assess work (i.e., function) and weakness of the diaphragm. This can be helpful in predicting difficulty in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.Patients who have weakness of the diaphragm may compensate with parasternal muscle activity. However, the feasibility of measuring parasternal intercostal muscle thickening with ultrasound and the ability of these measures to be combined with ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in order to predict ability to wean from mechanical ventilation has not been well explored. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW Parasternal intercostal muscle thickness can be measured with ultrasound with good interobserver reproducibility.Parasternal intercostal muscle thickening was responsive to the level of ventilator assistance and significantly higher (i.e., increased) in mechanically ventilated patients with diaphragm dysfunction.The pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm-thickening fraction, and the parasternal intercostal muscle-thickening fraction were all significantly associated with failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in mechanically ventilated patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dres, Martin; Dub\u00E9, Bruno-Pierre; Goligher, Ewan; Vorona, Stefannie; Demiri, Suela; Morawiec, Elise; Mayaux, Julien; Brochard, Laurent; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre","journal":"Anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diaphragm ultrasound","parasternal thickening fraction","diaphragm-thickening fraction","parasternal muscle thickening fraction","parasternal intercostal muscle thickening","parasternal intercostal muscle-thickening fraction","parasternal muscle activity","parasternal activity","responsiveness of parasternal","diaphragm work","assessment of diaphragm function","NEW Parasternal intercostal muscle thickness","absence of diaphragm dysfunction","ultrasound evaluation","ventilated patients","weaning patients","spontaneous breathing trial","CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound assessment","pressure support levels","weakness","increasing levels of pressure support","predicted failure","mechanical ventilation","combined evaluation","good interobserver reproducibility","ability","Spearman \u03C1","exploratory evaluation","feasibility","respiratory capacity load balance","important clinical information","novel information","inverse correlation","important role","intraclass correlation coefficient","intensive care unit","predicting difficulty","magnetic stimulation","extradiaphragmatic muscles","presence","level of ventilator assistance","progressive decrease","phrenic nerves","case of success","measures","order","BACKGROUND","healthy subjects","METHODS","ARTICLE","TOPIC","study"],"language":"en"},

Design, Setting, and Participants This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Results Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P \u003C .001).

Conclusions and Relevance In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Xiaoquan; Wang, Minghuan; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Li; Ran, Lusen; Chen, Daiqi; Zhang, Han; Shang, Ke; Xia, Chen; Wang, Shaokang; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Wei","journal":"JAMA network open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.9666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437575/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["line HCWs","clinical characteristics of HCWs","potential infection","higher infection rate","high infection risk","prevalence of subclinical infection","COVID","line physicians","line nurses younger","asymptomatic staff","years","medical staff","coronavirus disease","nonsevere disease","Tongji Hospital","Measures Exposure","asymptomatic population","incident rate ratio","total","early stage of disease outbreak","health care settings","Rapid identification of staff","main routes of exposure","observation of previous viral disease epidemics","single-center case series","demographic information","radiologic information","Importance Health care workers","Main Outcomes","indexed patients","environmental surfaces","fever clinics","electronic medical records","possible prevention measures","Participants","routine screening","median","Samples","Wuhan","infections","wards","interquartile range","Conclusions","Relevance","China","laboratory","research","Objectives","structured questionnaire","Design","common symptoms","Contact","myalgia","fatigue","sore throat","muscle ache","women","Exposures","colleagues","community","Results","Data","cough"],"language":"en"},

Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPFs) occurred in 39 (60.9%) cases, and most were biochemical leak POPF (29 cases, 45.3%); only 10 (15.6%) cases were grade B/C (8 cases were Grade B and 2 cases were Grade C treated with digital subtraction angiography). Bile leakage occurred in 2 (3.1%) patients. One (1.5%) patient had a gastric fistula, and 3 (4.7%) developed postoperative delayed gastric emptying categorized as International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) Grade A. Three (4.7%) patients were readmitted for postoperative bleeding, and 2 (3.1%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION Hybrid PD with laparoscopic and robot surgery is safe and feasible. OT can be reduced by switching from the laparoscopic approach to the robotic procedure at the appropriate timepoint.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Da-Bin; Zhao, Zhi-Ming; Xu, Yong; Liu, Rong","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07557-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery","CONCLUSION Hybrid PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","range","robotic surgery","robot surgery","invasive surgery","malignant cases","Grade C","grade B","CONCLUSION Hybrid PD","hybrid procedure","laparoscopic approach","days","International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery","laparoscopic route","robotic procedure","robotic approach","postoperative bleeding","relevant postoperative pancreatic fistulas","average length of postoperative stay","postoperative delayed gastric emptying","length of hospital","estimated blood loss","mean OTs","gastric fistula","mean number of lymph nodes","secondary endpoints","complications","operative time","gastrojejunostomy","hepaticojejunostomy","ISGPS","specimen resection","digital subtraction angiography","primary endpoint","EBL","surgeon","POPFs","experiences","biochemical leak POPF","pancreatojejunostomy","BACKGROUND","appropriate timepoint","indication","METHODS","electrical medical records","single institution","pancreatoduodenectomy","Bile leakage","aim","data"],"language":"en"},

Policy measures adopted to slow the transmission of disease are decreasing the demand for imaging independent of COVID-19. Hospital preparations to expand crisis capacity are further diminishing the amount of appropriate medical imaging that can be safely performed. While economic recessions generally tend to result in decreased health care expenditures, radiology groups have never experienced an economic shock that is simultaneously exacerbated by the need to restrict the availability of imaging. Outpatient heavy practices will feel the biggest impact of these changes, but all imaging volumes will decrease. Anecdotal experience suggests that radiology practices should anticipate 50%-70% decreases in imaging volume that will last a minimum of 3-4 months, depending on the location of practice and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region. The CARES Act provides multiple means of direct and indirect aid to healthcare providers and small businesses. The final allocation of this funding is not yet clear, and it is likely that additional congressional action will be necessary to stabilize health care markets. Administrators and practice leaders need to be proactive with practice modifications and financial maneuvers that can position them to emerge from this pandemic in the most viable economic position.

METHODS This is a retrospective case series study. Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020. RESULTS Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p\u003C0.001). Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively. There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash. While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases. Rheumatic patients presented with similar radiological features of ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease showed massive fibrous stripes and crazy-paving signs at an early stage. Five rheumatic cases used hydroxychloroquine before the diagnosis of COVID-19 and none progressed to critically ill stage.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020. Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years. Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded. Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement. Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. RESULTS. Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%). Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs. There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children. Eleven of 30 patients (37%) underwent follow-up chest CT, with 10 of 11 examinations (91%) showing no change, raising questions about the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSION. The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steinberger, Sharon; Lin, Bin; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Gao, Yuantong; Xie, Zongyu; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Mei, Xueyan; Little, Brent P","journal":"AJR.

Studies published on any date containing primary data comparing surgical facemasks and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and studies underpinning government PPE guidance, were included. Appraisal was performed using CASP checklists. Results were synthesised by comparison of findings and appraisals. RESULTS In all three laboratory studies of 14 different respirators and 12 surgical facemasks, respirators were significantly more effective than facemasks in protection factors, reduction factors, filter penetrations, and total inspiratory leakages at differing particle sizes, mean inspiratory flows, and breathing rates. Tests included live viruses and inert particles on dummies and humans. In six clinical studies, 6,502 participants, there was no consistent definition of \u0022exposure\u0022 to determine the efficacy of RPE. It is difficult to define \u0022safe\u0022. The only statistically significant result found continuous use of respirators more effective in clinical respiratory illness compared to targeted use or surgical facemask. CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of evidence on the comparison of FRSMs and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and poor-quality evidence in other contexts. Indirectness results in extrapolation of non-SARS-CoV-2 specific data to guide UK Government PPE guidance. The appropriateness of this is unknown given the uncertainty over the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 1. The evidence base for UK Government PPE guidelines is not based on SARS-CoV-2 and requires generalisation from low-quality evidence of other pathogens/particles. 2. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of RPE specific to SARS-CoV-2. 3. HMG\u0027s PPE guidelines are underpinned by the assumption of droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, the introduced method learns to generate graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future.

Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7% and 86.3% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3%) had at least one left-heart and/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0% (IQR 58.0-69.0%), with most (44,86.3%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3% vs. 23.1%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3% vs. 17.9%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF. Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction was associated with disease severity and increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, H.; Zhu, M.; Du, J.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, W.; Zhang, W.; Jiang, H.; Qiao, Z.; Gu, Z.; Li, F.; Pu, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7f6fa007b32ff0e6fc2d40f36ad7de1f33cf82c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20095885v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","LVEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction","heart echocardiographic abnormality","echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities","cardiac biomarkers","cardiac involvement","functional cardiac changes","Typical cardiac abnormality","confirmed COVID","preserved LVEF","serial echocardiographic study","functional features of cardiac impairments","non-survivors","high-sensitivity cardiac troponin","increased mortality","log-rank test","RV enlargement","disease severity","coronavirus disease","pulmonary hypertension","study period","serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations","pulmonary artery systolic pressure","similar survival curves","hs-cTnI","Kaplan-Meier analysis","ventricular ejection fraction","adverse impact","overall median","intensive care unit","CONCLUSIONS","brain natriuretic peptide","Increasing attention","Elevations of levels","scarce information","BACKGROUND","ventricle","total","RESULTS","cardiovascular comorbidities","METHODS","IQR","Outcomes"],"language":"en"},

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The peak is expected by March 29th at national level.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"DISTANTE, COSIMO; PISCITELLI, PRISCO; MIANI, ALESSANDRO","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24f659a804a2a2b86d91d4f7a652f530e0d78e06.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Emilia Romagna"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Lombardy","Whuan","Southern Regions","Calabria"],"keyphrases":["value of R0","R0 value","Lombardy","infection","Southern Regions","Southern Italian regions","Northern Regions","infected person","highest value","month period","exponential growth rate","Italy","epidemics","peak","average number of people","compartment model","day assessment","exponential fit","Northern ones","heavy burden of Covid","basic reproduction number","SEIR","Tuscany","Emilia Romagna","Veneto","Marche","outbreak progression","Piedmont","spreading","Apulia","better estimation","Secondary Measures","models","single observations","Lazio","account","agreements of values","entire time series","Chinese city of Whuan","Basilicata","Calabria","Abruzzo","methods","Campania region","Sicily","pandemic","Setting","national level","Molise","data","Objective","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

IU has been reliably associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it remains unclear whether IU would be related to disrupted extinction to other arousing stimuli that are not threatening (i.e., rewarding). We addressed this question by conducting a reward associative learning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). Throughout the associative learning task, we recorded valence ratings (i.e. liking), skin conductance response (SCR) (i.e. sweating), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward and neutral cues. During acquisition training with partial reward reinforcement, higher IU was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity to neutral compared to reward cues. IU was not related to valence ratings or SCR\u2019s during the acquisition or extinction training phases. These preliminary results suggest that IU-related deficits during extinction may be limited to situations with threat. The findings further our conceptual understanding of IU\u2019s role in the associative learning and extinction of reward, and in relation to the processing of threat and reward more generally.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morriss, Jayne; Biagi, Nicolo; Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Andreatta, Marta","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.101212","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extinction of reward","disrupted extinction","reward cues","extinction training phases","disrupted threat extinction","reward associative learning task","higher IU","IU-related deficits","acquisition training","partial reward reinforcement","valence ratings","neutral cues","processing of threat","greater corrugator supercilii activity","uncertainty anxiety-provoking","self-reported intolerance of uncertainty","brow muscle indicative","positive affect","conceptual understanding of IU\u2019s role","SCR\u2019s","relation","preliminary results","skin conductance response","findings","arousing stimuli","question","Individuals","situations"],"language":"en"},

Using Twitter data, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets. We analyzed a total of 259,529 unique tweets containing \u0022coronavirus\u0022 from 115,485 unique users between January 23, 2020 and March 24, 2020 that were identified by the Twitter API as English and U.S.-based.

Tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the U.S. from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. In January and February, facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, which were among the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the \u0022implementation\u0022 and \u0022negative emotions\u0022 facets of social distancing largely dominated in combination with topics of \u0022social disruption\u0022 and \u0022adaptation\u0022, albeit to a lesser degree. Social distancing can be defined in terms of facets that respond and represent certain moments and events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising COVID-19 case counts. For example, in February, Miami, FL had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March which corresponded with the rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. This suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, J.; Grady, C.; Feliciano, J.

One of the hallmark signatures of rapidly exerted, reactive motor inhibition is the non-selective suppression of cortico-spinal excitability (CSE): unexpected sensory stimuli lead to a suppression of CSE across the entire motor system, even in muscles that are inactive. Theories suggest that this reflects a fast, automatic, and broad engagement of inhibitory control, which facilitates behavioral adaptations to unexpected changes in the sensory environment. However, it is an open question whether such non-selective CSE suppression is truly due to the unexpected nature of the sensory event, or whether it is sufficient for an event to be merely infrequent (but not unexpected). Here, we report data from two experiments in which human subjects experienced both unexpected and expected infrequent events during a simple reaction time task while CSE was measured from a task-unrelated muscle. We found that expected infrequent events can indeed produce non-selective CSE suppression \u2013 but only when they occur during movement initiation. In contrast, unexpected infrequent events produce non-selective CSE suppression even in the absence of movement initiation. Moreover, CSE suppression due to unexpected events occurs at shorter latencies compared to expected infrequent events. These findings demonstrate that unexpectedness and stimulus infrequency have qualitatively different suppressive effects on the motor system. They also have key implications for studies that seek to disentangle neural and psychological processes related to motor inhibition and stimulus detection.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iacullo, Carly; Diesburg, Darcy A.; Wessel, Jan R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8dc2ccafca31670fe9da359436e6c33b99a9cc4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.008789","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suppression of CSE","unexpected events","unexpected infrequent events","non-selective CSE suppression","unexpected changes","unexpected nature","non-selective suppression of cortico","unexpected sensory stimuli","environmental events","reactive motor inhibition","entire motor system","sensory event","sensory environment","key control mechanism","absence of movement initiation","stimulus infrequency","stimulus detection","key implications","task-unrelated muscle","broad engagement of inhibitory control","simple reaction time task","spinal excitability","different suppressive effects","behavioral adaptations","shorter latencies","psychological processes","open question","unexpectedness","humans","actions","muscles","human subjects","contrast","hallmark signatures","experiments","studies","findings","response","data","Theories"],"language":"en"},

Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19.

While the analogous event in China appears to be rather under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of the evolution. Italy at present is playing a major role in understanding transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th - March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework we analyze the possible event of a secondary infection after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side the contact rate must obviously kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter \u03B4_I connected with the time t_I=1/\u03B4_I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy this time must fall under 12-8 hours in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover we show how the same parameter plays an even more relevant role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Traini, Marco Claudio; Caponi, Carla; Ferrari, Riccardo; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c9c599cd6c2232e1b77400be0f2b90d4b772030.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055392","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Italy","effectiveness of control measures","different control measures","possible event","long time","use of time","time t","early stage evolution data","possible secondary infection event","stringent measures","control strategies","isolation measures","parameter \u03B4","effects","SARS-CoV","contact rate","analogous event","longer term evolution","complementary parameter","quarantined class","quarantined models","observation data","new infections","transition rate","major role","western countries","relevant role","dependent contact","reproduction number","western social context","effective daily reproduction ratio","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","understanding transmission dynamics","symptomatic infected individuals","faster confirmation","introduction of detection technologies","rates","simplified scenarios compatible","certain minimum levels","thanks","moment","outbreaks","modern developed country","interpretation","order","Background","significant variations","present","China","hours","Methods","confirmed cases","conditions","framework","epidemic","diagnostic tests","case numbers","Outcomes"],"language":"en"},

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and Platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3\u002B Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and Platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in Platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with Platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and Platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and Platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy. Therefore, our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johri, S.; Jain, D.; Gupta, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20081182v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GMZA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Covid","Platelets","older patients","biology of Monocytes","phagocytic cells","aging cells","increased levels of monocytes","T-cells","higher expression of genes","infection","expressing genes","mirror gene expression changes","altered gene expression","age-associated gene expression changes","cell-types","hemodynamic changes","phagocytic route","single-cell sequencing studies","patient survival","cytokine signalling","viral pathogenesis","viral interactome","better patient management","integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data","pro-inflammatory signalling","results present molecular evidence","high fibrin degradation products","prolonged clotting time","D-dimers","recent reports","inflammation","anticoagulation therapy","significant pool","severe respiratory distress","clinical symptoms","reactive role","lung tissues","strong association","GNLY","disturbed morphology","hematopoietic origin","interaction","IL2RG","potential therapeutic targets","GMZA","virus","general enrichment","direction","non-ACE2","coagulopathy","study","FCGRA3"],"language":"en"},

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassanin, Alexandre","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a532af222e48c62311d39dafd94d91796f623d8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.077016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GD/P","Sequence Read Archive"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["P viruses","P genomes","P sequences","P datasets1","human virus","human SARS-CoV","P virus of poor quality","Guangdong","genome assemblies of GD","virus responsible","virus strain","data available","infection of human cells","capable of binding human ACE2 receptor","mitochondrial reads","unexpected reads","Illumina sequencing data","Sunda pangolins","captive pangolins","high levels of missing data","receptor binding domain","annotated sequences","sequencing errors","amino-acid sequence","Guangxi provinces of China","low levels of polymorphism","spike protein","Archive","SRA","previous studies2","Manis javanica","P2S dataset2","contamination","polymorphic nucleotide sites","pandemic","mouse","Covid","GenBank","lineages","characteristic","possibility","species","tiger","coexistence","captivity","absence"],"language":"en"},

This has necessitated the exploration of alternative diagnostic options to alleviate supply chain issues. Aim To establish and validate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Methodology We used a commercial RT-LAMP mastermix from OptiGene Ltd in combination with a primer set designed to detect the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single-tube, single-step fluorescence assay was implemented whereby as little as 1 \u03BCL of universal transport medium (UTM) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab could be used as template, bypassing the requirement for RNA purification. Amplification and detection could be conducted in any thermocycler capable of holding 65\u00B0C for 30 minutes and measure fluorescence in the FAM channel at one-minute intervals. Results Assay evaluation by assessment of 157 clinical specimens previously screened by E-gene RT-qPCR revealed assay sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively. Results were fast, with an average time-to-positive (Tp) for 93 clinical samples of 14 minutes (SD \u00B17 minutes). Using dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into UTM, we also evaluated assay performance against FDA guidelines for implementation of emergency-use diagnostics and established a limit-of-detection of 54 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 per ml (TCID50 mL\u22121), with satisfactory assay sensitivity and specificity. A comparison of 20 clinical specimens between four laboratories showed excellent interlaboratory concordance; performing equally well on three different, commonly used thermocyclers, pointing to the robustness of the assay. Conclusion With a simplified workflow, N1-STOP-LAMP is a powerful, scalable option for specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional resource in the diagnostic armamentarium against COVID-19. 3.

The impacts on mortality are likely to vary, in both magnitude and timing, by age and sex. Our aim was to estimate the total mortality impacts of the pandemic, by sex, age group and week. Methods: We developed an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models that probabilistically estimate the weekly number of deaths that would be expected had the Covid-19 pandemic not occurred. The models account for seasonality of death rates, medium-long-term trends in death rates, the impact of temperature on death rates, association of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s), and the impact of bank holidays. We used data from January 2010 through mid-February 2020 (i.e., week starting 15th February 2020) to estimate the parameters of each model, which was then used to predict the number of deaths for subsequent weeks as estimates of death rates if the pandemic had not occurred. We subtracted these estimates from the actual reported number of deaths to measure the total mortality impact of the pandemic. Results: In the week that began on 21st March, the same week that a national lockdown was put in place, there was a \u003E92% probability that there were more deaths in men and women aged [\u2265]45 years than would occur in the absence of the pandemic; the probability was 100% from the subsequent week. Taken over the entire period from mid-February to 8th May 2020, there were an estimated [~] 49,200 (44,700-53,300) or 43% (37-48) more deaths than would be expected had the pandemic not taken place. 22,900 (19,300-26,100) of these deaths were in females (40% (32-48) higher than if there had not been a pandemic), and 26,300 (23,800-28,700) in males (46% (40-52) higher). The largest number of excess deaths occurred among women aged \u003E85 years (12,400; 9,300-15,300), followed by men aged \u003E85 years (9,600; 7,800-11,300) and 75-84 years (9,000; 7,500-10,300). The cause of death assigned to the majority (37,295) of these excess deaths was Covid-19. There was nonetheless a \u003E99.99% probability that there has been an increase in deaths assigned to other causes in those aged [\u2265]45 years. However, by the 8th of May, the all-cause excess mortality had become virtually equal to deaths assigned to Covid-19, and non-Covid excess deaths had diminished to close to zero, or possibly become negative, in all age-sex groups. Interpretation: The death toll of Covid-19 pandemic, in middle and older ages, is substantially larger than the number of deaths reported as a result of confirmed infection, and was visible in vital statistics when the national lockdown was put in place. When all-cause mortality is considered, the mortality impact of the pandemic on men and women is more similar than when comparing deaths assigned to Covid-19 as underlying cause of death.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kontis, V.; Bennett, J.

Substantial, non-discriminatory limitations have been imposed on air travel to inhibit this spread. As the disease prevalence and incidence will decrease, more specific control measures will be sought so that commercial air travel can continue to operate yet not impose a high threat of COVID-19 resurgence. Methods: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates to analyse the risk posed by 1364 airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. We calculate the risk using a probabilistic approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the R0 of each location, scaled by population density. This exercise is performed globally as well as specifically for two potentially vulnerable locations: Africa and India. Results: We show that globally, many of the airports posing the highest risk are in China and India. An outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa is most likely to originate in a passenger travelling from Europe. On the other hand, the highest risk to India is from domestic travellers. Our results are robust to changes in the underlying epidemiological assumptions. Conclusions: Variation in flight volumes and destinations creates a non-uniform distribution of the risk different airports pose to resurgence of a COVID-19 outbreak. We suggest the method presented here as a tool for the estimation of this risk. Our method can be used to inform efficient allocation of resources, such as tests identifying infected passengers, so that they could be differentially deployed in various locations.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daon, Yair; Thompson, Robin N; Obolski, Uri","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07a6bab4dccb5d0d721b144514da2d1b0f520cee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067496","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","China","Europe","India"],"keyphrases":["highest risk","outbreak of COVID","risk different airports","India","commercial air travel","high threat of COVID","modelled global air travel data","volume of air travelers","resurgence","Africa","spread","Results","population density estimates","vulnerable locations","various locations","non-uniform distribution","destinations","flight volumes","incidence","tests","Variation","R0","non-discriminatory limitations","probabilistic approach","efficient allocation of resources","domestic travellers","specific control measures","Conclusions","Methods","tool","China","hand","underlying epidemiological assumptions","infected passengers","months","disease prevalence","estimation","globe","pandemic","Europe","Background","exercise"],"language":"en"},

Given the high social and economic cost of these viruses, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection. Viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Lysosome delivery is facilitated by non-canonical autophagy pathways that conjugate LC3 to endo-lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal IAV infection of the airways. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yingxue; Zhang, Weijiao; Jefferson, Matthew; Sharma, Parul; Bone, Ben; Kipar, Anja; Coombes, Janine L.; Pearson, Timothy; Man, Angela; Zhekova, Alex; Bao, Yongping; Tripp, Ralph A; Yamauchi, Yohei; Carding, Simon R.; Mayer, Ulrike; Powell, Penny P.; Stewart, James P.; Wileman, Thomas","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02a97ed705da868b047c12ed93697b1ce893f01c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.15.907873","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV infection of lung","lethal IAV infection","fusion of IAV","non-canonical autophagy pathways","virus infection","systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy","lung inflammation","mice","lethal inflammation","lysosome fusion","high mortality","Respiratory viruses","low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV","airway epithelial cells","Lysosome delivery","airways","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","endo-lysosome compartments","epithelial barriers","fulminant pneumonia","pneumonia lead","cytokine amplification","respiratory surfaces","cytokine storm syndrome","analysis","endosomes","LC3","cause pandemic infections","novel innate defence mechanism","extensive viral replication","conditional mouse models","Covid","lungs","linker domains of ATG16L1","protection","reduced activation of interferon signalling","independent of phagocytes","comprehensive understanding","urgent need","WD","economic cost","influenza","SARS-CoV","endocytosis","lysosomes","leukocytes","degradation"],"language":"en"},

There are over 1 million cases around the world with this disease and it continues to raise. Studies on COVID-19 patients have reported high rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among them and patients with CVD had higher mortality rate. Objectives: Since there were controversies between different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to study cardiovascular disease burden among COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Study Selection: Studies reported cardiovascular disease among hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with mortality or ICU admission (primary outcomes) were included into meta-analysis. In addition, all of studies which reported any cardiovascular implication were included for descriptive meta-analysis. Cohort studies, case-control, cross-sectional, case-cohort and case series studies included into the study. Finally, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for primary outcome and 59 studies for descriptive outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two investigators have independently evaluated quality of publications and extracted data from included papers. In case of disagreement a supervisor solved the issue and made the final decision. Quality assessment of studies was done using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using I-squared test and in case of high heterogeneity (\u003E%50) random effect model was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was calculated for Cardiac Troponin I. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. Results: Sixteen papers including 3473 patients entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and fifty-nine papers including 9509 patients for descriptive outcomes. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 15.94, 95% CI 2.31-110.14), hypertension (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.92-2.74), heart Failure (OR: 11.73, 95% CI 5.17-26.60), other cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.17-3.24) and overall CVDs (OR: 3.37, 95% CI 2.06-5.52) were significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Arrhythmia (OR: 22.17, 95%CI 4.47-110.04), acute cardiac injury (OR: 19.83, 95%CI 7.85-50.13), coronary heart disease (OR: 4.19, 95%CI 1.27-13.80), cardiovascular disease (OR: 4.17, 95%CI 2.52-6.88) and hypertension (OR: 2.69, 95%CI 1.55-4.67) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our findings showed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shamshirian, Amir; Heydari, Keyvan; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Abrotan, Saeed; Hessami, Amirhossein","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0be3b02264d5ec556e1d77ec9067e5a7566a5a1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062869","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CVD","Google Scholar","ICU","Data Extraction","Intensive Care Unit"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different studies","descriptive meta-analysis","Cohort studies","monitoring COVID","pandemic of COVID","cardiovascular disease burden","mortality outcome","ICU admission","case series studies","Results of meta-analysis","Proper management of CVD patients","high rate of cardiovascular disease","Meta-analyses","hospitalized adult COVID","Quality assessment of studies","different CVDs","case-cohort","CVD burden","descriptive outcomes","cardiovascular implication","high burden of CVDs","higher mortality rate","case of high heterogeneity","coronary heart disease","case-control","case of disagreement","acute cardiac injury","papers","acute cardiac conditions","primary outcomes","overall CVDs","Cardiac Troponin","Main Outcomes","Data Extraction","Data Sources","Study Selection","hypertension","searched databases","Hand searched","heart Failure","evaluated quality of publications","World Health Organization","Cochrane Library","Embase","investigators","SMD","Web of Science","Standardized Mean Difference","Intensive Care Unit","Scopus","PubMed","controversies","journal websites","inclusion criteria","systematic review","issue","Synthesis","Measures","squared test","findings","Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool","medRxiv pre-print database","Odds Ratio","Google Scholar","supervisor","critical situations","random effect model","final decision","Conclusion","cases","Objectives","addition","Arrhythmia","Importance"],"language":"en"},

Despite being comparable for sounds presented back-to-back, discrimination was better for harmonic than inharmonic stimuli when sounds were separated in time, implicating memory representations unique to harmonic sounds. Patterns of individual differences indicated that listeners use different representations depending on the time delay between sounds, directly comparing the spectra of temporally adjacent sounds, but transitioning to comparing f0s across delays. The need to compress sound into memory appears to determine reliance on f0-based pitch, and may explain its importance in music, in which listeners must extract relationships between notes separated in time.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"McPherson, Malinda J.; McDermott, Josh H.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da07b111d5a2e1f0a6198163201e783f7f656e4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inharmonic sounds","adjacent sounds","discrimination of harmonic","inharmonic spectra","implicating memory representations unique","different representations","listeners","time delay","inharmonic stimuli","need","delays","finite memory resources","f0-based pitch","sound\u2019s pitch","compressed formats","incoming signals","reliance","Patterns of individual differences","Perceptual systems","contrast","importance","relationships","notes","compression","fundamental frequency","music","f0s"],"language":"en"},

We retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93). We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality, either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1 without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17). Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%) patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical outcome (both, P\u003E0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Our findings indicated that limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival and prudent dose within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill patients under certain circumstances.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, X.; Chen, T.; Wang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhang, B.; Li, Y.; Yan, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20056390v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","Addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy","effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment","standard antiviral treatment of patients","elevated mortality risk","day mortality","limited effect of corticosteroid therapy","major mortality-associated variables","efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids","adjustment","COVID","clinical outcome","risk stratification model","non-steroid group","increased corticosteroids dosage","individual propensity score","log-rank test P","adjusted HR","clinical practice","hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage","entire cohort","overall survival","lymphocyte count","SpO2","multivariate logistic regression","potential differences","pairs","coronavirus disease","administration duration","prudent dose","FiO2","effective limits","case-control analysis","replacement","milligram","findings","certain circumstances","ARDS","subgroup analyses","evidence","dyspnea"],"language":"en"},

To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we evaluated the utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to detect microbial pathogens in HCT patients with acute respiratory illnesses. We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent BAL at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and simultaneously assess the host transcriptional response. Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays. mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing. Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis); findings were confirmed by independent PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Relative to patients without infection, patients with infection had increased expression of immunity related genes (p=0.022) and significantly lower diversity of their respiratory microbiome (p=0.017). Compared to conventional diagnostics, mNGS enhanced detection of pathogens in BAL fluid from HCT patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining unbiased microbial pathogen detection with assessment of host gene biomarkers of immune response may hold promise for enhancing the diagnosis of post-HCT respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2017-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langelier, C; Zinter, MS; Kalantar, K; Yanik, GA; Christenson, S; Odonovan, B; White, C; Wilson, M; Sapru, A; Dvorak, CC; Miller, S; Chiu, CY; DeRisi, JL","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d418cdee18b07a0adfb553d43b4a08f7736fa9f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/102798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["LRTI","BAL","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCT patients","respiratory microbes","respiratory microbiome","acute respiratory illnesses","diagnosis of post-HCT respiratory infections","respiratory syncytial virus","BAL fluid","etiology of lower respiratory tract infections","human rhinovirus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","human herpesvirus","microbial pathogens","mNGS enhanced detection of pathogens","conventional diagnostics","unrecognized LRTI pathogens","improved LRTI diagnostics","post-HCT adults ages","standard testing","Current microbiologic diagnostics","Results","host transcriptional response","conventional microbiologic assays","unbiased microbial pathogen detection","generation sequencing","lower diversity","assessment of host gene biomarkers of immune response","S rRNA sequencing","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","increased expression of immunity related genes","Corynebacterium propinquum","years","hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients","findings","independent PCR","cytomegalovirus","bronchoalveolar lavage","Streptococcus mitis","utility of metagenomic","sensitivity","need","University of Michigan","implementation of targeted therapies"],"language":"en"},

It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors, which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise ACE2 levels, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: We evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of 205 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at King\u0027s College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, London, UK with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 7-days of symptom onset. Findings: 53 patients out of 205 patients reached the primary endpoint. Contrary to the hypothesis, treatment with ACE-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease. There was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days in patients on an ACE-inhibitor OR 0.29 (CI 0.10-0.75, p\u003C0.01), adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure). Interpretation: Although a small sample size, we do not see evidence for ACE-inhibitors increasing the short-term severity of COVID-19 disease and patients on treatment with ACE-inhibitors should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness.

The PEDV membrane protein (M) plays crucial roles in viral assembly, viral budding and host immune regulation, most likely by interacting with host cell proteins that have yet to be identified. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) using an M-specific monoclonal antibody, coupled with LC-MS/MS, was employed to identify M protein-interacting proteins in PEDV-infected cells. Three viral proteins (S, E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins were identified as putative M-interacting partners. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to 131 signal pathways and 10 biological processes. In addition, interaction between translation initiation factor 3(eIF3L) and M protein was validated by Co-IP. Down-regulation of eIF3L expression significantly increased viral production, which suggests that eIF3L could be a negative regulator in PEDV replication. This interactome study of the PEDV M protein will serve to clarify its function during viral replication.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ruiyang; Yu, Ruisong; Chen, Bingqing; Si, Fusheng; Wang, Jian; Xie, Chunfang; Men, Chengfang; Dong, Shijuan; Li, Zhen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5de7c2debb0c79f7ed3de6ec40a2cd052d2e381.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113520303643; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520303643?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV M"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","identified host cell proteins","viral replication","PEDV replication","PEDV membrane protein","viral assembly","viral budding","viral production","Co-IP","host immune regulation","PEDV-infected cells","regulation of eIF3L expression","co-immunoprecipitation","severe diarrhea","LC-MS","interactome study","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","ages","crucial roles","ORF3","pigs","translation initiation factor","coronavirus","signal pathways","high fatality rate","addition","interaction","negative regulator","specific monoclonal antibody","Bioinformatic analysis","neonates","biological processes","function","partners"],"language":"en"},

Methods: This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.

A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction (based on the supplier\u0027s label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the supplier\u0027s quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory bodies.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jue, E.; Ismagilov, R.

Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT. In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.

There are currently no therapeutic options for mitigating this disease due to lack of a vaccine and limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology. As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, Xiaohua; Han, Yuling; Yang, Liuliu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Wang, Pengfei; Zhang, Tuo; Xiang, Jenny; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Uhl, Skyler; Huang, Yaoxing; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Wang, Hui; tenOever, Benjamin; Schwartz, Robert E.; Ho, David.

A report from April 29 revealed 1.26 million confirmed cases and 125 928 deaths in Europe. This study proposed a novel deep neural network framework, COVID-19Net, which parallelly combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs). Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied Germany, Italy, and Spain to extract spatiotemporal feature and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net were compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which are commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which were considerably lower than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework can accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as a crucial reference for devising public health strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, C.-J.; Shen, Y.; Kuo, P.-H.; Chen, Y.-H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/035a9b1d0696fe18a8514a49a1c6b353c44f56ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20086538v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNN"],"locations":["March 26","Europe","Spain","Germany"],"keyphrases":["COVID","mean absolute error","mean absolute percentage error","models","square error","CNN-GRU","accumulated number of confirmed cases","Italy","Germany","Spain","proposed framework","convolutional neural network","novel deep neural network framework","European countries","prediction results","used model assessment indices","bidirectional gated recurrent units","crucial reference","severe outbreaks","root","public health strategies","GRUs","study","spatiotemporal feature","deaths","coronavirus disease","pandemic","accuracy","report"],"language":"en"},

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) between hospitals within NHS trusts, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We coarse-grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. Estimates of weekly ICU demand can be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion-to-ICU likelihood estimates, and through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy. The cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases nationally in a single step of the algorithm, leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lacasa, L.; Challen, R.; Brooks-Pollock, E.; Danon, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f39446767099344fae11d3ef9cdf341281933bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.20049239v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units","NHS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU treatment","ICU likelihood estimates","uniform ICU demand","total number of ICU units","Estimates of weekly ICU demand","level of NHS trusts","Intensive Care Units","patients","NHS system","optimisation strategies","access","set of geopositioned trusts","number of cases","algorithm","best load sharing strategy","feasibility of transfer","different cost functions","random search optimisation","optimal re-routing strategies","additional criteria","contagion","flexible allowing","capacity","hospitals","framework","methodology","given trust","nearest neighbors","local health services","epidemiological model","lives","single step","test","resources","ventilators","regular geometric graph","large percentage","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.

Screens were designed such that only guides that decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13-mediated fashion, were valid.

Similar screens were performed for guides against SARS-CoV-2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect.

DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of five focus groups carried out between 1st-4th May 2020 (39-42 days after the official start of the UK lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 22 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of different genders, ages, ethnicities and locations. RESULTS: Participants were split roughly equally in number across three groups: will use the app; will not be using the app; and undecided as to whether they will use the app. Analysis revealed five main themes: (1) Lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4) concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the \u0027greater good\u0027. These themes were found across the sample and the three groups. However, concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those state they will not be using the app and the view that the app is for the \u0027greater good\u0027 was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: We offer four recommendations: (1) To offset the fact that many people may not be accessing, or might be avoiding, news coverage on COVID-19, authorities must communicate to the public via a range of methods including but not limited to: social media ads, postal information, text messaging and other emergency alert systems. (2) Communications should emphasise that the app cannot enable the user to identify which of their contacts has reported COVID-19 symptoms or tested positive. (3) Communication should emphasise collective responsibility (\u0027the greater good\u0027) to promote social norms around use of the app (4) Communication should provide a slogan that maximises clarity of message, for example: \u0027Download the app, protect the NHS, save lives\u0027.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, S.

This pandemic has affected most of the countries in the world because the high global movement of individuals and excessive cost in interventions. Objective: Using demographic data from city of Cali, disease epidemiological information from affected countries and mathematical models, we estimated the rate of initial exponential growth of new cases and the basic reproductive rate for a potential outbreak in city of Cali in Colombia. Materials and methods: We used dynamical models with different modeling assumptions such as use of various types of interventions and/or epidemiological characteristics to compare and contrast the differences between Colombian cities and between Latin American countries. Results: Under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources, we predicted expected number of infected, hospitalized, in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and deaths during this potential COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that on a given day in Cali there may be up to around 73000 cases who might need hospitalization under no intervention. However, this number drastically reduces if we carry out only-isolation intervention (with 16 days of symptomatic infection; [~]13,000 cases) versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days ([~]3500 cases). The peak in Cali will reach in 2-3 months.

Within four months of the first reported cases, more than two and a half million cases were confirmed with over two hundred thousand deaths globally, and many countries had taken extreme measures to stop the spread. In this work, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 103 countries over the period 22 January to 13 April 2020. We utilise a novel stochastic epidemiological model that includes a regulatory mechanism that captures the level of tolerance to rising confirmed cases within the response behaviour. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we identify that the top ten outbreaks as of 31 March are characterised by a high tolerance to rising cases tallies, whereas countries that avoided severe outbreak have a low tolerance. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher identification rate. As of 13 April, almost all countries show declines in transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers. Furthermore, countries approaching recovery also increased their identification rate between 31 March and 13 April. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in undocumented infections dramatically impacts uncertainty in predictions.

With many PCR-based molecular assays, an extraction step is routinely used as part of the protocol. This step can take up a significant amount of time and labor, especially if the extraction is performed manually. Long assay time, partly caused by slow sample preparation steps, has created a large backlog when testing patient samples suspected of COVID-19. Using flu and RSV clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can be performed directly on patient sample material from a nasal swab immersed in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step. We have also used this approach to test for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 reference materials spiked in VTM. Our data, while preliminary, suggest that using a few microliters of these untreated samples still can lead to sensitive test results. If RNA extraction steps can be omitted without significantly affecting clinical sensitivity, the turn-around time of COVID-19 tests and the backlog we currently experience can be reduced drastically. Next, we will confirm our findings using patient samples.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arumugam, Arunkumar; Wong, Season","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/637a3428061da47914f6dabed131e9a523f69851.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.028811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","RSV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patient samples","RNA extraction steps","time of COVID","RT-qPCR assay","Long assay time","VTM","patient sample material","untreated samples","acute SARS-CoV","sensitive test results","molecular assays","slow sample preparation steps","large backlog","clinical sensitivity","direct detection of SARS","RSV clinical specimens","nasal swab","Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","virus transport medium","Emergency Use Authorization","evidence","gold standard","Disease Control","Prevention","CDC","companies","EUA","reference materials","turn","tests","Centers","flu","microliters","approach","infection","labor","experience","findings","data","protocol"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication.

The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020 while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020 was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p\u003C0.001). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tariq, Amna; Lee, Yiseul; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Blumberg, Seth; Yan, Ping; Ma, Stefan; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac1389094394112be7f3017f62c2e1afe362a5c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["local transmission","Singapore","local cases","monitoring transmission","transmission wave","transmission potential of COVID","active case","effective reproduction number","imported cases","active chains of transmission","autochthonous cases","local incidence curve","unique case example","truncation of case counts","need","days","ongoing COVID","overall mean","estimate","available daily case series","distribution of cluster sizes","cluster size distribution","overall R","reporting delays","significant effects of successful containment efforts","sub-exponential growth dynamics","branching process analysis","associated intervention strategies","date of symptoms onset","real time","social distancing","geographic heterogeneity","declining trend","multiple disease clusters","Wilcoxon test","epidemic","trajectory","world","China"],"language":"en"},

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects.

Severe patients progressed rapidly to Critical condition including multi-organ failure and even death. Identification of early predictive factors is urgently necessary to facilitate appropriate intensive care. METHODS We included all patient admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital and treated by the supportive medical team of Beijing Tongren Hospital as of March 20, 2020. Indicators of injuries for multiple organs, including the heart, kidney and liver, and glucose homeostasis were specifically analyzed for predicting primary outcomes (an intensive care unit (ICU) or death). RESULTS The data of 120 patients with a severity equal to or greater than Moderate, discharged or died were extracted. After excluding patients with history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients were included in the final analysis. There were 26 cases with primary outcomes including 16 deaths. Univariable analysis indicated that fasting blood glucose (FBG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), creatine kinase and creatinine were associated with primary outcomes and death. Among patients with primary outcomes, although FBG levels were much higher on admission, they dramatically decreased subsequently, while in deceased patients they increased continuously. Multivariable Cox regression indicated that FBG\u22657mmol/L was the only independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15). Cluster analysis found more proximities of FBG (at the time of admission) with LDH, HDDH or Creatinine (after 2-4 days of hospitalization) (r=0.43, 0.43 and 0.50, respectively, P\u003C0.01 for all). Conclusions Blood glucose is a representative of the clustered indicators of multi-organ injury and earlier predictor for poor outcomes and death in the COVID patients. As it is easy to perform for clinical practices and self-monitoring, glucose testing will be much helpful for predicting poor outcomes to facilitate appropriate intensive care.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jin-Kui; Jin, Jian-Min; Liu, Shi; Bai, Peng; He, Wei; Wu, Fei; Liu, Xiao-Fang; Han, De-Min","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multivariable Cox"],"organizations":["FBG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary outcomes","COVID patients","Severe patients","deceased patients","poor outcomes","appropriate intensive care","FBG levels","glucose testing","proximities of FBG","glucose homeostasis","fasting blood glucose","Conclusions Blood glucose","intensive care unit","LDH","kidney","liver disease","creatinine","Univariable analysis","Cluster analysis","final analysis","multi-organ failure","clustered indicators of multi-organ injury","hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase","lactate dehydrogenase","earlier predictor","chronic heart","independent predictor","Indicators of injuries","Coronavirus Disease","time of admission","Wuhan Union Hospital","supportive medical team of Beijing Tongren Hospital","HBDH","Critical condition","representative","clinical practices","self-monitoring","creatine kinase","multiple organs","severity equal","history of diabetes","Identification of early predictive factors","ICU","Multivariable Cox regression","mmol","HDDH","OBJECTIVE","cases","deaths","days of hospitalization","CI","data","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

COVID19 driven pandemic causes panic, fear and stress among all strata of society. Like all other medical professions, dentists, particularly endodontists, who are highly exposed to aerosols would be exposed to stress. The aim of this study was to assess the (dis)stress among Indian endodontists and the factors that could influence the (dis)stress. Methods: From 8th April to 16th April 2020, we conducted an online survey in closed endodontic social media using snowball sampling technique, collecting basic demographic data, practice setting and relevant data. Psychological stress and perceived distress were collected through COVID-19 Peri-traumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and Perceived stress scale (PSS). Multinomial regression analysis was performed to estimate relative risk rate and P[\u2264]0.05 was considered significant. Results: This study had 586 Indian endodontists completing this survey across India. Of these, 311(53.07%) were males, 325(55%) in the age group of 25-35 years, 64%in urban areas, 13.14% in solo-practice and a fourth of them were residents. Female endodontists had high perceived stress (RRR=2.46,P=0.01) as compared to males, as measured by PSS. Younger endodontists\u003C25 years(RRR=9.75;P=0.002) and 25-35years (RRR=4.60;P=0.004) as compared with \u003E45 years age-group had more distress. Exclusive consultants had RRR= 2.90, P=0.02, for mild-to-moderate distress as compared to normal. Factors driving this phenomenon are considered. Conclusions: During the lock down due to COVID-19, 1-in-2 Indian endodontists had distress, as measured by CPDI and 4-in-5 of them had perceived stress, as indicated by PSS.

The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the fourth month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment.

Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Moraes, Diogo; Paiva, Brunno Vivone Buquete; Cury, Sarah Santiloni; Junior, Jo\u00E3o Pessoa Ara\u00FAjo; da Silva Mori, Marcelo Alves; Carvalho, Robson Francisco","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ceec895af54ccfb9f7a4954a63a96dfcd6b987c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030767","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TRIB3 expression","express SARS-CoV","decreased expression of TRIB3","replication","lung aging","human protein-coding genes","HCoVs nucleocapsid protein","lung senescence","Genotype-Tissue Expression","virus infection","male individuals","COVID","available lung single-cell data","alveolar damage","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","human coronavirus","Old individuals","Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes","alveolar epithelial cells","mitotic cell cycle","older male patients","transcriptional changes","host cellular factors","aged lungs","gene tribbles homolog","respiratory failure","pneumonia","GTEx","induced perturbations","surfactant metabolism","susceptibility","severe cases","receptor ACE2","potential therapy","disease","drugs","elderly","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could profoundly impact the health care system if a subset were to be PCR-positive again with reactivated SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE To characterize a single center COVID-19 cohort with and without recurrence of PCR positivity, and develop an algorithm to identify patients at high risk of retest positivity after discharge to inform health care policy and case management decision-making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 414 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to April 23, 2020. EXPOSURES Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IgM-IgG antibody confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Univariable and multivariable statistical analysis of the clinical, laboratory, radiologic image, medical treatment, and clinical course of admission/quarantine/readmission data to develop an algorithm to predict patients at risk of recurrence of PCR positivity. RESULTS 16.7% (95CI: 13.0%-20.3%) patients retest PCR positive 1 to 3 times after discharge, despite being in strict quarantine. The driving factors in the recurrence prediction model included: age, BMI; lowest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for cholinesterase, fibrinogen, albumin, prealbumin, calcium, eGFR, creatinine; highest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase; the first test results during hospitalization for partial pressure of oxygen, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, blood procalcitonin; and the first test episodic Ct value and the lowest Ct value of the nasopharyngeal swab RT PCR results. Area under the ROC curve is 0.786. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This case series provides clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with recurrent PCR positivity, despite strict quarantine, at a 16.7% rate.

Tests base on IgM/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% \u002B- 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 \u002B- 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 \u002B- 0.007, precision of 0.938 \u002B- 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 \u002B- 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed.

This study examines PCPs\u0027 concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS 216 PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were convenience sampled from three primary care organizations in Singapore. Participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, and a source of risk and concern to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks and the need to care for COVID-19 patients. Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high. PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors.

With a relatively high case fatality ratio and limited testing capacity, the number of confirmed cases reported is suspected to suffer from significant under-reporting. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and assessing the effectiveness of the interventions that have taken place in Iran while accounting for the uncertain level of underreporting is of critical importance. We use a mathematical epidemic model utilizing official confirmed data and estimates of underreporting to understand how transmission in Iran has been changing between February and April 2020. METHODS: We developed a compartmental transmission model to estimate the effective reproduction number and its fluctuations since the beginning of the outbreak in Iran. We associate the variations in the effective reproduction number with a timeline of interventions and national events. The estimation method also accounts for the underreporting due to low case ascertainment by estimating the percentage of symptomatic cases using delay adjusted case fatality ratio based on the distribution of the delay from hospitalization to death. FINDINGS: Our estimates of the effective reproduction number ranged from 0.66 to 1.73 between February and April 2020, with a median of 1.16. We estimate a reduction in the effective reproduction number during this period, from 1.73 (95% CI 1.60-1.87) on 1 March 2020 to 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.70) on 15 April 2020, due to various non-pharmaceutical interventions including school closures, a ban on public gatherings including sports and religious events, and full or partial closure of non-essential businesses. Based on these estimates and given that a near complete containment is no longer feasible, it is likely that the outbreak may continue until the end of the 2020 if the current level of physical distancing and interventions continue and no effective vaccination or therapeutic are developed and made widely available. INTERPRETATION: The series of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the public compliance that took place in Iran are found to be effective in slowing down the speed of the spread of COVID-19 within the studied time period. However, we argue that if the impact of underreporting is overlooked, the estimated transmission and control dynamics could mislead the public health decisions, policy makers, and general public especially in the earlier stages of the outbreak.

With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, and such measures have been adopted in countries around the world, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Worby, Colin J; Chang, Hsiao-Han","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc9b7b99074f28886502d3efc3293366841c55b5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20052696","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of face masks","role of face masks","optimal deployment of face masks","deaths","face mask use","general population","mitigation of transmission","spread of COVID","proportion of available resources","random distribution of masks","mitigation efforts","regional spread","limited protective effect","symptomatic persons","vaccine available","infected cases","epidemic models","various scenarios","range of scenarios","vulnerable healthy persons","total reduction of infections","numerous national healthcare systems","exceeding capacity","balancing provision","closure of non-essential businesses","restrictions","schools","pathogen","recommendations","ongoing novel coronavirus disease","interventions","common asymptomatic carriage","suboptimal strategy","countries","broad agreement","elderly","widespread socioeconomic disruption","world","measures","summary","Prioritizing coverage","peak time","pandemic","tens of thousands","study"],"language":"en"},

As the growth rates {lambda}(t) of tested positive COVID-19 cases have crossed the threshold in many countries, with negative numbers as surrogate for disease transmission deceleration, lockdowns lifting are linked to the behavior of the momentary reproduction numbers r(t), often called R0. Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases - significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the COVID-19 responses, are used as an exercise to estimate the momentary growth rates and reproduction numbers over time in the Basque Country, and the implications of using those concepts to make decisions about easing lockdown and relaxing social distancing measures are discussed. These results are potentially helpful for task forces around the globe which are now struggling to provide real scientific advice for health managers and governments while the lockdown measures are relaxed.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguiar, M.; Van-Dierdonck, J.

Under the R\u0026D Blueprint Plan of Action, the World Health Organization (WHO) has convened a group of experts to agree on standard procedures to rapidly evaluate experimental vaccines during PHEs while maintaining the highest scientific and ethical standards. The Blueprint priority diseases, selected for their likelihood to cause PHEs and the lack of adequate medical countermeasures, were used to frame our methodological discussions. Here, we outline major vaccine study designs to be used in PHEs and summarize high-level recommendations for their use in this setting. We recognize that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the Blueprint priority diseases may be highly uncertain and that the unique characteristics of the vaccines and outbreak settings may affect our study design. To address these challenges, our group underscores the need for novel, flexible, and responsive trial designs. We conclude that assignment to study groups using randomization is a key principle underlying rigorous study design and should be utilized except in exceptional circumstances. Advance planning for vaccine trial designs is critical for rapid and effective response to a PHE and to advance knowledge to address and mitigate future PHEs.

Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA. Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. Conclusions: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Black, M.

Current treatment of COVID-19 is limited and mostly supportive. At present, there is no specific therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we discovered that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin, two FDA-approved drugs for treatment of human diseases, had significant antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, with EC50 values for the reduction of viral RNA at nanomolar concentrations. Both drugs completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at lower drug concentrations than that of remdesivir. The selection indices of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin are 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting wide safety margins. Both drugs were able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as suppress established SARS-CoV-2 infection. The compounds share a porphyrin ring structure. Molecular docking indicates that the compounds may interact with viral receptor ACE2 and could block the cell-cell fusion mediated by ACE2 and viral S protein. Our finding suggests that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin might be potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and also sheds new light on the development of a novel class of small compounds against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Chenjian; Wu, Yang; Guo, Huimin; Zhu, Yuanfei; Xu, Wei; Wang, Yuyan; Sun, Zhiping; Cai, Xia; Li, Yutang; Liu, Jing; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Deng, Qiang; Qu, Di; Xie, Youhua","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e319c13d0cc4b813924eb9f2d278d048b8eb173e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.071290","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of SARS","established SARS-CoV","verteporfin","viral receptor ACE2","reduction of viral RNA","cell-cell fusion","viral S protein","FDA-approved drugs","selection indices of protoporphyrin","novel class of small compounds","cytopathic effect","nanomolar concentrations","significant antiviral effect","treatment of human diseases","lower drug concentrations","Current treatment of COVID","development","numbers of infected people","EC50 values","potential antivirals","regions","specific therapeutics","CPE","new light","deaths","remdesivir","porphyrin ring structure","wide safety margins","countries","present","Molecular docking","finding","study"],"language":"en"},

We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus.

Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19.

We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan.

Actual observations less than forecasts mean successful policy interventions. Figures of Doubling Time, Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate used by authorities are questioned. Elongation of doubling rates is inherent in the model, and worthy of mention only when the time actually exceeds what the model predicts. The popular Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate metrics are shown to be illogical. The study defines two terms Ongoing Fatality Rate (OFR), and Ongoing Recovery Rate (ORR) and determines these currently to be ~9% and ~76% respectively in India. Over time, OFR will decline to the eventual Case Fatality Rate (CFR), while ORR will eventually climb to (1-CFR). There is no statistical basis to assume eventual Indian CFR, and 5.5% CFR at China is used as a proxy. Using these metrics, the current model forecasts by May-end, \u003E150000 Total Infected, [~]5000 Deaths and \u003E85000 Active Cases. There is no pull-back evident in the current model in the foreseeable future, and cases continue to rise at progressively slower rates. Subject to usual caveats, the model is used to forecast till Sep 15. The study argues that Indian hospital infrastructure is reasonably ready to handle Active Cases as predicted for Sept 15: in that sense, the curve is FLAT ENOUGH. However, the curve is NOT flat enough with respect to fatalities: nearly 100000 by Sept 15. Setting an arbitrary limit that Total Deaths must be within 50,000 by Sept 15, the study retrofits a model that shows what the desired growth of Covid19 cases should be. It is seen that overall doubling time of 38 days is required in period June 1 to Sep 15, if deaths are to remain below 50000.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dey, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a31c3e2a8893fa0cefd0f490d0c96903aee162a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20097865v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Case Fatality Rate"],"locations":["India","China"],"keyphrases":["current model forecasts","time-series model","popular Fatality Rate","Ongoing Recovery Rate","Recovery Rate metrics","Active Cases","study","Total Covid cases","terms Ongoing Fatality Rate","eventual Case Fatality Rate","Total Deaths","Number of Total Infected Cases","Figures of Doubling Time","overall doubling time","eventual Indian CFR","desired growth of Covid19 cases","OFR","Elongation of doubling rates","days","ORR","curve","statistical basis","policy initiatives","statistical validity","slower rates","Indian hospital infrastructure","successful policy interventions","end","cautionary discussion of triggers","pandemic","foreseeable future","Actual observations","worthy of mention","respect","degree polynomial","Subject","usual caveats","comparator","arbitrary limit","data","authorities","early phases","models","fatalities","pull","China","objectives","sense","purpose","proxy","period","R2"],"language":"en"},

There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Pulmonary rehabilitation is well placed to deliver a rehabilitation programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post Covid-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-Covid-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post Covid-19 to inform service delivery. Design A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free text comments box allowing for a qualitative analysis. Setting Online survey. Participants British Thoracic Society members and multi-professional clinicians, across specialities were invited to take part. Results 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialities over 6 days. There was overwhelming support for early post discharge from hospital phase of the recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed/ strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%), and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) 92%. At the 6-8-week time point an assessment was considered important, focusing on the assessment of a broad range of possible symptoms and the need to potentially return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free text comments added depth to the survey and the need not to reinvent the wheel rather adapt well established (pulmonary rehabilitation) services to accommodate the needs of the post Covid-19 population.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A.; Blair, Christopher; Weber, Andrew; Barnes, Betsy J.; Egeblad, Mikala; Woods, Robert J.; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0109d1273b2d59a099ab66cdad6939d5e7fcb2e8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059626","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-free DNA","MPO-DNA","hospitalized patients","high levels of NETs","severe COVID","role of NETs","lungs of patients","elevated levels of cell","specific markers of NETs","Cit-H3","elevated levels of blood neutrophils","predictive power of circulating NETs","platelet levels","respiratory failure","absolute neutrophil count","Neutrophil extracellular traps","control neutrophils","sera","acute respiratory distress syndrome","citrullinated histone H3","cytokine release","acute phase reactants","extracellular webs of chromatin","triggered NET release","potential clinical relevance","severe cases of coronavirus disease","C-reactive protein","microbicidal proteins","mechanical ventilation","findings","D-dimer","longitudinal cohorts","worse outcomes","novel therapeutic targets","samples","myeloperoxidase","oxidant enzymes","lactate dehydrogenase","microvascular thrombosis","extent","individuals","inflammation","data","viral pneumonia","Future studies","summary","room air","infections"],"language":"en"},

We consider a SEIR-like epidemic model where that contact and quarantine rates are assumed to depend on the available information and rumors about the disease status in the community. The model is applied to the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy.

We used data from two large nationally representative household surveys, administrative sources, and published studies to estimate the risk of COVID-19 at the district level in India. We employed principal component analysis to create a composite index of the health risk of COVID-19 from demographic and comorbidity indicators such at the proportion of elderly population and rates of diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. We created another principal component index of the socioeconomic and healthcare access risk from COVID-19, based on the standard of living, proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and per capita access to public healthcare in each district. We found that districts in northern, southern and western Indian states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra were at the highest health risk from COVID-19. Many of these districts have already been designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the Indian government because of emergent outbreaks. Districts in eastern and central states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh have higher socioeconomic and healthcare access risk as compared with other areas.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nandi, A.; Balasubramanian, R.; Laxminarayan, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20079749v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Uttar Pradesh"],"locations":["India","Maharashtra","Madhya Pradesh"],"keyphrases":["health risk of COVID","healthcare access risk","highest risk","highest health risk","districts","healthcare infrastructure","public healthcare","principal component index","district level","measures","western Indian states","principal component analysis","Madhya Pradesh","Uttar Pradesh","central states","composite index","Indian government","local level","proportion of elderly population","administrative sources","representative household surveys","Punjab","Bihar","Maharashtra","rates of diabetes","Tamil Nadu","novel coronavirus","hypertension","lockdowns","published studies","disadvantaged groups","Kerala","restrictions","comorbidity indicators","incident cases","hotspots","demographic","populations","SARS-COV","emergent outbreaks","respiratory illnesses","data","standard of living","areas","year","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We applied a simulated two-arm controlled study design to the data on compassionate use of remdesivir as a secondary analysis. Dynamics of risk states and death from COVID-19 patients defined by the six-point disease severity recommended by the WHO R\u0026D and the time to discharge from hospital were used to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care. Results: Stratified by the risk state at enrollment, low-risk patients exhibited the highest efficacy of remdesivir in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state by 67% (relative risk (RR)=0.33,95% CI: 0.30-0.35) and further to death by 55% (RR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.39-0.50). For the medium-risk patients, less but still statistically significant efficacy results were noted in reducing progression to high-risk state by 52% (RR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.45-0.51) and further to death by 40% (RR=0.60, 95% CI:0.54-0.66).

Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19. Objective: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Participants: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported race/ethnicity. Main outcome measures: We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Results: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87). Conclusions: Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Zhou; Li, Xianbin; Li, Houqiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bb89950ec5a06e2b7f69b2a9c4213dda19b1ab0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030858","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SEIR"],"locations":["China","Wuhan City","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["number of infected people","number of infected persons","Wuhan City","case of new coronavirus infection","epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection","virus-infected person","new coronavirus infections","infection dynamics model","number of confirmed diagnoses","new coronaviruses","infection-Removal","traditional model","infection rate","premise","traditional SEIR model","city closure measures","average daily number of contacts","epidemic Prevention","epidemic situation","modified SEIR model","Wuhan Municipal Government","contact transmission","isolation measures","control of infectious diseases","incubation period","level response measures","outbreak","peak","time","results","main routes of transmission","Chinese Spring Festival","universal prevention","public data","changing trend","close contact","global public health security","China","country","basic assumptions","Ebola viruses","established dynamic equations","Matlab","amendments","prediction","susceptibility-exposure","actual evolution","action","parameters","department","appropriate optimization","Hubei Province","classical kinetic system","SARS","huge threat","Respiratory droplets","vital role","differences","conditions","Recommendations","article","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","simulation","significant change","illness","days","mask"],"language":"en"},

In addition to infectious and respiratory disease physicians, many doctors in other medical fields have been infected. Methods We prospectively collected epidemiological data on medical staff members who are working in neurosurgery departments in 107 hospitals in Hubei province through self-reported questionnaires or telephone interviews. Data of medical staff members with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were analysed. The final follow-up date was 1 March 2020. Findings A total of 5,442 neurosurgery department medical staff members were surveyed. One hundred and twenty cases, involving 54 doctors and 66 nurses, were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The overall incidence was 2.2%. These cases were concentrated in 26 centres, 16 of which had admitted a total of 59 patients with COVID-19 complicated by craniocerebral disease. Medical staff members in centres receiving COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of contracting infection than those in centres not receiving COVID-19 patients (relative risk: 19.6; 95% confidence interval: 12.6-30.6). Contact with either COVID-19 patients (62.5%, 75/120) or infected colleagues (30.8%, 37/120) was the most common mode of transmission. About 78.3% (94/120) of the infected cases wore surgical masks, whereas 20.8% (25/120) failed to use protection when exposed to the source of infection. Severe infections were observed in 11.7% (14/120) of the cases, with one death (0.8%, 1/120). All the infected medical staff members had been discharged from the hospital. A total of 1,287 medical staff members were dispatched to participate in the frontline response to COVID-19 under level 2 protection of whom one was infected. Medical staff members who took inadequate protection had a higher risk of contracting infection than those using level 2 protection (relative risk: 36.9; 95% confidence interval: 5.2-263.6). Interpretation Neurosurgical staff members in Hubei province were seriously affected by COVID-19. Level 2 protection and strengthening of protective measures are likely to be effective in preventing medical workers from being infected.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qiangping; Huang, Xing; Bai, Yansen; Wang, Xuan; Wang, Haijun; Hu, Xuebin; Wang, Feng; Wang, Xianke; Chen, Jincao; Chen, Qianxue; Jiang, Xiaobing; Zhao, Hongyang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20064899v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["infected medical staff members","COVID","Data of medical staff members","infected cases","neurosurgery department medical staff members","medical workers","medical fields","Interpretation Neurosurgical staff members","infected colleagues","patients","Hubei province","inadequate protection","relative risk","level","total","centres","higher risk of contracting infection","coronavirus disease","craniocerebral disease","doctors","source of infection","SARS-CoV","confidence interval","respiratory disease physicians","neurosurgery departments","epidemiological data","novel coronavirus","large number of healthcare workers","self-reported questionnaires","hospitals","laboratory","telephone interviews","protective measures","addition","China","Findings","surgical masks","frontline response","final follow-up date","common mode of transmission","Methods","Contact","overall incidence","Severe infections","nurses","death"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (\u003E77%) and considered effective (\u003E90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin Kit; Chan, Ho Hin; Yi, Yuan Yuan; Tang, Arthur; Wei, Wan In; Wong, Yeung Shan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aa49aa2b76ea92b9265ad9d5a9d9ef0ea585b24.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China","New Territories"],"keyphrases":["Community responses","current COVID","respondents","aOR","early phase","good understanding of COVID","high perceived susceptibility","high perceived severity","risk perception","complete responses","anxiety level","trusted information sources","common information sources","psycho-behavioral responses of hosts","perceived efficacy of precautionary measures","actual adoption","Hospital Anxiety","adoption of social","greater adoption","behavioral assessment","disease progression","distancing measures","self-protective measures","epidemic progresses","alert","broadcast","study","newspaper","risk communication strategies","subsequent interventions","survey dissemination","non-pharmaceutical interventions","cross-sectional online survey","outbreak management","female","travel avoidance","district council constituency areas","Depression Scale","addition","personal hygiene practices","major preventive options","Respondent demographics","adjusted odds ratio","China","mechanistic aspects","hours","Analysis","Councilors","Method","official websites reliable","Result","doctors","Background","Hong Kong","Discussion","drivers","New Territories","cases","daily routines"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between LUS findings and chest CT in confirmed (positive RT-PCR) or clinically highly suspicious (dyspnea, fever, myasthenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry cough, ageusia or anosmia) of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of confirmed or clinically highly suspicious COVID-19 patients who were subjected to a chest CT and concurrent LUS exam. An experienced ED physician performed the LUS exam blind to the clinical history and results of the CT scan, which were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus for signs compatible with COVID-19 (bilateral ground-glass opacities in peripheral distribution). Compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, fifty-one patients were consecutively enrolled. The indication for CT was a negative or indeterminate RT-PCR test (49.0%) followed by suspicion of pulmonary embolism (41.2%). Radiological signs compatible with COVID-19 were present in thirty-seven patients (72.5%) on CT scan and forty patients (78.4%) on LUS exam. The presence of LUS findings was correlated with a positive CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 (OR: 13.3, 95%CI: 4.5-39.6, p\u003C0.001) with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 78.6%, positive predictive value of 92.5% and negative of 100.0%. There was no missed diagnosis of COVID-19 with LUS compared to CT in our cohort. The LUS Score had a good correlation with CT total severity score (ICC 0.803, 95% CI 0.60-0.90, p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION: LUS presents similar accuracy compared to chest CT to detect lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"tung chen, y.; Marti de Gracia, M.; DiezTascon, A.; Agudo-Fernandez, S.; Alonso-Gonzalez, R.; Rodriguez Fuertes, P.; Parra-Gordo, L.; Ossaba-Velez, S.; Llamas Fuentes, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2815c95869d32d9ec5d66ac726b59299888d08e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095117v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["LUS","CT","LUS Score"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest CT","LUS Score","patients","Compatible LUS exam","positive CT scan suggestive of COVID","LUS exam blind","concurrent LUS exam","suspicious COVID","presence of LUS findings","CT total severity score","missed diagnosis of COVID","chest X-ray","positive RT-PCR","Computed Tomography scan","Radiological signs compatible","results","positive predictive value","good correlation","lung abnormalities","imaging findings of Coronavirus Disease","indeterminate RT-PCR test","Prospective study","bilateral pattern of B","role of Lung Ultrasonography","experienced ED physician","bilateral ground-glass opacities","myasthenia","lines","gastrointestinal symptoms","irregular pleural line","clinical history","dry cough","ageusia","fever","ICC","anosmia","similar accuracy","subpleural consolidations","peripheral distribution","dyspnea","evidence","consensus","emergency department","main purpose","moment","specificity","radiologists","CONCLUSION","suspicion of pulmonary embolism","OBJECTIVES","sensitivity","METHODS","indication","cohort","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. We further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time; (2) within the United States, the emergence of an endogenous U.S. subtype that is distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is linked instead to subtypes found in Europe; and (3) dynamic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes in different countries around the world over time. Our results demonstrate that utilizing ISMs for genetic subtyping can be an important complement to conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, because ISMs are efficient and compact subtype identifiers, they will be useful for modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools to help enhance containment, therapeutic, and vaccine targeting strategies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made the subtype identification pipeline described in this paper publicly available at https://github.com/EESI/ISM. Author Summary The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 1.3 million confirmed cases worldwide by April 7, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking dynamics of viral pandemics in real-time. Through the beginning of April 2020, researchers obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from nearly 4,000 infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individual\u2019s exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome \u2014 so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or \u201Csubtypes\u201D of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 17 base-long label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \u201CISM.\u201D We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) showing distinct viral subtypes of infections in Europe emanating from Italy to other countries over time, and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is connected to Europe.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Zhengqiao; Sokhansanj, Bahrad A.; Rosen, Gail L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38175edd1856eda40afb863e3acccc6c9c37750.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Informative Subtype"],"locations":["Europe","United States","U.S.","China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["emergence of subtypes","distinct genetic subtypes of infections","subtypes prevalent","genetic sequences of SARS","ISMs of global SARS-CoV","distinct viral subtypes of infections","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","regional distribution of subtypes","Efficient identification of subtypes","viral subtype distribution","pattern of distinct regional subtypes","dynamic emergence of SARS","local subtype","genetic subtyping","sequence data","Informative Subtype Marker","tracking emergence","time","compact subtype identifiers","subtype identification pipeline","label genetic variants","informative of genetic variation","later development of subtypes specific","pandemic virus","robust subtype definition","COVID","sequence basis","available data","different countries","Europe emanating","data-mining","importance of tracking dynamics of viral pandemics","Italy","geographic distribution","genome sequences","outbreak","United States","efficient framework","New York","paper","method results","novel coronavirus responsible","important complement","useful information","different regions","infected individuals","base-long label","temporal dynamics of infectious spread","conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses","ambiguity","noise","individual\u2019s exposure location","earlier transmission","interregional differences","containment","machine learning tools","nucleotide sites","China","application","entropy analysis","Author Summary","sample date","vaccine","Asia","localization","researchers","world","progress","strategies","error correction technique","modeling","example","bases","Major findings","confirmed cases","beginning"],"language":"en"},

In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massonnaud, Cl\u00E9ment; Roux, Jonathan; Cr\u00E9pey, Pascal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f6c9f8b12a63ad5d901e83862ea73cb7f3e3599.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036939","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Europe","France"],"keyphrases":["R0","ICU beds","expansion of French ICU capacities","best case scenario","France","worst case","French healthcare system","reaching date of ICU capacity limits","worst scenario","French metropolitan Region","daily number of COVID","total number of deaths","healthcare resources","total number of infected cases","mild scenario","Regions","national level","regional level","different scenarios","results","outbreak","needs","catchment areas","Bourgogne-Franche","SEIR","model","intensive care units","hospitalizations","drastic social distancing measures","age-structured","Grand-Est","SARS-CoV","massive reorganization","increasing concern","epicenter","Comt\u00E9","dynamics","pandemic","coming wave","referral hospitals","study","impacted country","epidemic","Corse","month","predictions","aim","Europe","patients","analysis"],"language":"en"}]}

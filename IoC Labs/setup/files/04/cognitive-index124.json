Secondly, previously considered noninfectious diseases are identified contagious as a result of new etiological findings. Thirdly, new infectious diseases are incurred by various complicated reasons such as evolution of pathogens. Due to their uncertainty and unpredictability, EIDs could result in high mortality and great impacts on social stability and economic development as people are unable to react immediately and take specific preventive or control measures. Therefore, EIDs have become a major public health problem worldwide. Cases in point are the epidemics of SARS in 2003 and H7N9 avian influenza around 2006, which have eloquently demonstrated their great threats to human health, society, and economy.

Together, both the structural studies on the astrovirus virion and capsid spike domains have revealed similarities to hepatitis E virus, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. The only other structural information on astrovirus is from the high-resolution crystal structure of the protease that is involved in nonstructural polyprotein processing.

This period saw a previously unknown TSE emerge in cattle and then transmit to humans, a scenario which by August 2009 had cost 164 people their lives in the UK and which has resulted in an unknown number of other people incubating variant CJD (vCJD). The economic damage caused by this disease has been considerable. In April 2000, the government estimated that by the end of the 2001/2002 financial year, the total net cost of the BSE crisis to the Exchequer would be \u00A33.7 billion (BSE Inquiry Report, Volume 10: 1). Less quantifiable consequences have also stemmed from this crisis. Chief amongst them has been significant damage to the public\u2019s ability to trust the pronouncements of government on matters of food safety and risk. The scientific community has suffered inestimable damage to its expertise and to its capacity to provide objective, consistent scientific advice to the public. With such serious consequences emanating from the BSE affair, it is incumbent on all those who were involved in this tragic episode to reflect on the events that took place and to consider how things could have been done better. Such a reflective exercise has, of course, been conducted by Lord Phillips and his inquiry team who examined all the events that took place during the BSE epidemic and drew a wide-ranging set of lessons from these events. A reflective purpose is also a central motivation of the current chapter. However, the focus of this reflection \u2013 scientific reasoning in contexts of uncertainty \u2013 is altogether narrower than that undertaken during the public inquiry into BSE. Moreover, the question of reasoning in contexts of uncertainty was omitted from Lord Phillips\u2019 inquiry into BSE and has also been overlooked within the vast literature that has been written on the topic of BSE both before and after this inquiry was conducted.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, Louise","journal":"Rethinking the BSE Crisis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81eb12cb5224e86bcce48e270888728b7381fb0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lord Phillips"],"organizations":["UK","Exchequer","BSE Inquiry Report"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BSE crisis","BSE Inquiry Report","BSE affair","BSE epidemic","topic of BSE","public inquiry","events","inquiry team","scientific reasoning","contexts of uncertainty","scientific community","Lord Phillips","significant damage","inestimable damage","people","public health","economic damage","place","UK","consistent scientific advice","difficult period","pronouncements of government","question of reasoning","unknown number","unknown TSE","serious consequences","reflective purpose","quantifiable consequences","reflective exercise","total net cost","central motivation","financial year","matters of food safety","variant CJD","public\u2019s ability","wide-ranging set of lessons","capacity","objective","reflection","current chapter","risk","cattle","end","vCJD","disease","expertise","focus","Volume","Exchequer","humans","tragic episode","Chief","lives","standard","vast literature","scenario","things"],"language":"en"},

Het tijdperk van delayed degenerativediseases, d.w.z. geen uitschakeling ziekten maar uitstel naar hogere leeftijden (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Daling sterfte hart- en vaatziekten door afname roken, daling serumcholesterol, betere opsporing hypertensie, betere medische zorg. Daling verkeersongevallen door verkeersveiligheid (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Ischemische hartziekte werd van managersziekte een \u0027volksziekte\u0027 (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Terugkeer infectieziekten na 1970 door resistentie micro-organismen tegen antibiotica en nieuwe infectieziekten zoals hiv/aids, SARS (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Levensverwachting Nederlanders neemt toe, maar minder snel dan andere Europese landen (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). In de twintigste eeuw vijf tot acht jaar winst in levensverwachting door verbeteringen gezondheidszorg (o.a. antibiotica, vaccinaties, combinatiechemotherapie, verbeteringen chirurgie) (zie paragraaf 3.2.2). infecties bovenste luchtwegen; nek- en rugklachten; acute urineweginfecties; priv\u00E9ongevallen; contacteczeem. nek- en rugklachten; contacteczeem; artrose; diabetes mellitus; coronaire hartziekten. Kwaliteit van leven: 11% van Nederlanders van 12 jaar en ouder heeft een of meer ernstige functionele beperkingen (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Top-5 aandoeningen met grootste verlies kwaliteit van leven is ander rijtje dan top-5 aandoeningen met hoogste prevalentie. Angststoornissen en depressie staan hoog in rangorde want beperkt sociaal functioneren (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Sterfte belangrijkste indicator volksgezondheid. Sterftegegevens betrouwbaar en registratie over het algemeen volledig (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Door toename levensverwachting is het relatieve belang van sterfte als indicator volksgezondheid verminderd (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Belangrijkste doodsoorzaken Nederland. Mannen: kanker. Vrouwen: hart- en vaatziekten (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Levensverwachting wordt berekend met behulp van overlevingstafel en geboortecohort (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). gezonde levensverwachting; health-adjusted life expectancy; disability-adjusted life years (DALY\u0027s). : Anticonceptie en vruchtbaarheidsproblemen. Geboorteregeling in Nederland nagenoeg perfect. Keerzijde: uitstellen zwangerschappen. Perinatale sterfte en zuigelingensterfte. Sinds jaren tachtig verloopt daling in Nederland minder snel dan bijvoorbeeld Zweden en Finland, door o.a. meerlingzwangerschappen (door ivf), roken, allochtone herkomst zwangeren, verschillen in zorg. Barkerhypothese: groeivertraging foetus heeft langetermijngevolgen voor gezondheid. Foetale programmering: aanpassingen van metabole en endocriene systeem van foetus onder invloed van tekort aan voedingsstoffen zijn schadelijk op latere leven. Ongevallen, su\u00EFcide(poging) en geweld: ongevallen in de priv\u00E9sfeer zorgen voor meeste aantal gewonden en overledenen. Moord en doodslag in Nederland vrij zeldzaam. Alcoholgebruik speelt bij verschillende categorie\u00EBn een rol (zie paragraaf 3.3.3). : Depressie. Prevalentie 5%. Kwetsbaarheid en uitlokkende factoren spelen rol. Schizofrenie. Prevalentie 7 gevallen per 1.000 personen. Openbaart zich vaak op jonge leeftijd, tussen 16 en 24 jaar. Combinatie kwetsbaarheid en omgevingsfactoren. Komt meer voor bij Marokkanen en Surinamers, waarschijnlijk door migratie-ervaringen en/of discriminatie. . Thuisloosheid: vaak oorzaak ernstige psychische problemen. : Ischemische hartziekte. Hoge incidentie komt o.a. door toegenomen welvaart en roken, hoge bloeddruk en hoog serumcholesterol. Beroerte. Een derde toe te schrijven aan verhoogde bloeddruk. Ook verhoogd serumcholesterol, roken, overmatig alcoholgebruik en lichamelijke activiteit. Westerse ziekte en gevolg van modern voedingspatroon (met veel zout). Kanker. Strijd tegen kanker geen succesverhaal. Vroegere opsporing, dus overlevingsverbetering is deels artificieel. Longkanker heeft hoogste sterfte. Huidkanker komt het meest voor. Borstkanker komt na longkanker het meest voor bij vrouwen. Bevolkingsonderzoek leidt tot verbetering opsporing en daling sterfte. : Vergrijzing. Beperkingen: chronische ziekten, mobiliteit, slechthorendheid, dementie. Ontwikkelingen van (gezonde) levensverwachtingen: meningen zijn verdeeld. Evolutiebiologen denken dat bovengrens misschien bereikt is. Euthanasie: vormt uiterste puntje op heel scala aan medische beslissingen rond levenseinde, zoals intensivering pijnbestrijding en palliatieve sedatie. Relatief risico (RR): de verhouding van de incidentie van een ziekte bij personen met en zonder blootstelling aan een bepaalde determinant (zie paragraaf 3.4.1). Populatieattributieve fractie (PAF): de proportie van de totale incidentie van een ziekte binnen de bevolking die toe te schrijven is aan de blootstelling aan een bepaalde determinant (zie paragraaf 3.4.1). Voor de berekening van PAF hoeft de incidentie van de ziekte niet bekend te zijn. Kan met behulp van RR. Voor formules voor berekening RR en PAF, zie paragraaf 3.4.1. : Infectieziekten. Omgekeerde samenhang tussen ernst infectie en besmettelijkheid. Verspreidingswegen. Meldingsplicht bij ziekten als bacillaire dysenterie, kinkhoest, legionellose, malaria en tuberculose. Maag-darminfecties. Voedselvergiftiging komt op grote schaal voor. Hepatitis. A: verspreiding langs fecaal-orale weg. B: via bloed en andere lichaamsvloeistoffen, C: via bloed en veel gezien onder hemofiliepati\u00EBnten. Vectorgebonden infectieziekten: Malaria (importziekte). Ziekte van Lyme (via tekenbeten, wel in Nederland). Klimaatverandering verhoogt risico\u0027s op vectorgebonden infectieziekten. Zo\u00F6nosen: infectieziekten van dier op mens. Creutzfeldt-Jakob, hondsdolheid, ornithose/psittacose, Q-koorts, SARS, vogelgriep. Risico is vermoedelijk toegenomen door verstoring ecosystemen en klimaatverandering. Soa\u0027s: ook in Nederland neemt frequentie toe, vermoedelijk door toename onveilig vrijen. Komt ook door besef dat behandeling hiv/aids is verbeterd. : Omgevingstemperatuur: verhoging sterfte met hittegolven en koude wintermaanden. Vooral bij kwetsbare groepen. Lawaai. Op werk of thuis. Stress en slaapverstoring kan tot hoge bloeddruk leiden. Veel jongvolwassenen gehoorschade door popconcerten. Ultraviolette straling. Veroorzaakt huidkanker. Neemt erg toe laatste jaren door verandering gedrag bevolking en dunner worden ozonlaag. Chemische stoffen. Asbest, metalen, oplosmiddelen. Geen grote bron gezondheidsschade in Nederland. Luchtverontreiniging. \u0027Fijn stof\u0027 zorgt vermoedelijk voor flink aantal extra sterfgevallen, maar nog niet duidelijk waarop dat effect berust. EU-norm wordt in grote delen van Nederland overschreden. Klimaatverandering. Gevolgen grotendeels onbekend. . : Psychosociale stress. Life events en arbeidssituatie kan invloed hebben. Sociale steun heeft gunstig effect op psychosociale stress. Roken. Verhoogd risico hart- en vaatziekten, kanker en COPD. Tabakswet van 2002 is mijlpaal in antirookbeleid. Rokers in Nederland onder 30%. Middenmoter in Europa. Alcohol en drugs. Veel lichamelijke en psychische problemen en oorzaak huiselijk geweld en zinloos geweld. Comazuipen onder jongeren in Nederland probleem. Ecstasygebruik ook hoog. Voeding. Nederlanders eten te vet en te weinig fruit en groenten, wat risico hart- en vaatziekten vergroot. Lichaamsbeweging. Helpt beschermen tegen hart- en vaatziekten, diabetes, depressie, borst- en dikkedarmkanker. Helft van de Nederlanders beweegt te weinig. . Energiebalans en overgewicht. Obesitas in Nederland 11% onder volwassenen en neemt toe. : Genen versus omgeving en gedrag. Genen belangrijk bij gezondheid individuen, niet zozeer bij volksgezondheid. Genen en ziekte. Rol genetische factoren bij ontstaan ziekte varieert sterk. . Belang van preventie. Belangrijk om meer inzicht te krijgen in genetische determinanten van multifactori\u00EBle aandoeningen. Gezondheidsverschillen naar geslacht (zie paragraaf 3.5.1): vrouwen worden ouder maar groter aantal jaren met minder goede gezondheid. Gezondheidsverschillen naar burgerlijke staat (zie paragraaf 3.5.1): gehuwden leven langer. : Arbeidsmarktpositie. Werkenden gezonder dan werklozen en arbeidsongeschikten. Sociaaleconomisch. Mensen met een lagere sociaaleconomische positie zijn vaker ziek. : Regionale verschillen. Verstedelijkte gebieden en aantal regio\u0027s in noordoosten hogere sterfte- en ziektecijfers. Brabant en Limburg hebben achterstand. Urbanisatiegraad. In grote steden sterfte hoger. Komt door veranderde bevolkingssamenstelling (gezonde bewoners vertrekken naar elders), niet door slechte levensomstandigheden.","publish_time":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackenbach,

Bei h\u00F6heren Lebewesen sehen wir dies als selbstverst\u00E4ndlich an und teilen Sie in Fleisch- und Pflanzenfresser ein. Bei niederen Lebewesen bezeichnen wir dies jedoch als pathogene Eigenschaft oder als parasit\u00E4re Lebensweise, wenn wir ihnen als Nahrungsgrundlage dienen. Zur Abwehr der Krankheitserreger entwickelten alle h\u00F6heren Lebewesen ein Immunsystem, um das Fortbestehen der Spezies zu garantieren. Je weiter sich die Lebewesen entwickelt haben, desto h\u00F6her hat sich auch das Immunsystem in einer Coevolution in Konkurrenz zu den Erregern entwickelt. Da das Immunsystem in der Evolution zur Infektionsabwehr entstanden ist, leiten sich seine \u00FCbrigen physiologischen und pathophysiologischen Mechanismen von denen der Infektionsabwehr ab. Die Tumorabwehr entspricht der Abwehr von Viren und die Allergie der Abwehr von \u201Enicht vorhandenen Parasiten\u201C. Damit ist die Infektionsimmunologie der zentrale Punkt der Immunologie.

The first successful cancer treatments were arsenic-based therapies for leukemias, with the first reported application to cancer in the nineteenth century. However, nitrogen mustards are often accredited as the first modern chemotherapy. Originally intended as a chemical warfare agent in World War I, nitrogen mustard was stockpiled by several countries. During World War II, Axis bombers sunk a ship containing large quantities of nitrogen mustard and killed numerous Allied sailors. This observation birthed the hypothesis that nitrogen mustards might prevent the rapid division of cancer cells, one of the few properties of cancer understood at that time. Today, the hallmarks of cancer as recently redefined by Hanahan and Weinberg include several complex and connected cellular properties that allow for this phenotype: resistance to cell death, sustained angiogenesis, limitless ability to replicate, self-sufficiency in growth factor signaling, unresponsiveness to anti-growth factor signaling, genomic instability and mutation, deregulating cellular energetics, evading immune-mediated destruction, oncogenic inflammation, and invasiveness and metastasis. The identification and understanding of these hallmarks is a direct result of our molecular understanding of cancer that has surfaced relatively recently. Each of these hallmarks is determined by a host of molecules that together represent distinct therapeutic opportunities to target molecules that give rise to these defining properties of cancer.","publish_time":"2016-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allen, Joshua E.; El-Deiry, Wafik S.","journal":"The Molecular Basis of Human Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c3b1a325d8894fee4142e09e49f572377d6cddb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Weinberg"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["properties of cancer","hallmarks of cancer","molecular understanding of cancer","successful cancer treatments","nitrogen mustards","rapid division of cancer cells","cellular properties","large quantities of nitrogen mustard","World War","anti-growth factor","cellular energetics","host of molecules","cell death","genomic instability","oncogenic inflammation","sustained angiogenesis","limitless ability","immune-mediated destruction","ship","unresponsiveness","arsenic-based therapies","Axis bombers","leukemias","resistance","self-sufficiency","mutation","phenotype","distinct therapeutic opportunities","direct result","chemical warfare agent","numerous Allied sailors","invasiveness","rise","reported application","metastasis","Weinberg","Ancient Egyptian documents","Hanahan","observation","hypothesis","century","countries","time","efforts","modern chemotherapy","identification"],"language":"en"},

Impaired innate and adaptive immunity, potential anatomical abnormalities resulting from extensive surgical procedures, presences of indwelling medical devices, and increased healthcare exposure put transplant recipients at particularly high risk for respiratory tract disease. Infections of the respiratory tract can be divided into those affecting the paranasal sinuses, the upper airways such as bronchitis and tracheobronchitis, and the lower airways like pneumonia. Each of these clinical syndromes can further be classified based on their chronicity, acute vs. chronic; their setting, community vs. nosocomial; and the etiology such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and rarely parasites. It is also important to realize that such immunologically vulnerable patients are at risk for polymicrobial infection that may present concurrently or in a sequential, consecutive fashion.

In a given population, the levels of perceived risk of infection vary greatly among individuals. The difference in perception could be due to a number of different factors including varying levels of information regarding the pathogen, quality of local healthcare, availability of preventive measures, individual and group usage of heuristics in the decision-making process. First we discuss the rigorous assessment of the risk, then we describe how our brain assesses the risk through the use of heuristics that are still rooted in animal evolution. Then we discuss the impact and the role of mass media and social networks in modulating risk perception. Next, we show how mathematical modelling is challenged by multi-scale epidemiological problems where the risk perception level is coupled with all the other microscopic and macroscopic levels. Finally, we draw future scenarios of personal risk evaluation through self-monitoring devices and personal genomics.

PEDV infection causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration, and high morbidity and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. In this chapter, materials and methods for performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of PEDV antigens in frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are provided. In IHC of frozen tissues where viral antigens are well preserved, the use of specific antibodies labeled with fluorescence dyes provides excellent advantages and convenience, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity of IHC and reduction of operation time. In IHC of FFPE tissues where tissue or cell morphology is well preserved, the use of specific antibodies labeled with enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, also gives rise to significant advantages in defining the correlation of viral antigens with histopathologic lesions. PEDV antigens in frozen tissues are visualized as green staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by fluorescent dyes conjugated with antibodies when activated by exciting light of a specific wavelength under a fluorescence microscope. In FFPE tissues, PEDV antigens are visualized as red staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by the deposition of the substrate chromogen, Fast Red.","publish_time":"2015-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil","journal":"Animal Coronaviruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2552c4941d8e1e349686d7ec0d0b427ecb3ac3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IHC of frozen tissues","IHC of FFPE tissues","detection of PEDV antigens","PEDV infection","use of specific antibodies","correlation of viral antigens","specificity of IHC","cytoplasm of infected cells","fluorescence dyes","specific wavelength","significant advantages","high morbidity","green staining","red staining","high sensitivity","fluorescent dyes","acute diarrhea","excellent advantages","fluorescence microscope","significant economic losses","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","vomiting","North American swine industries","mortality","dehydration","deposition","convenience","cell morphology","previous years","enzymes","seronegative neonatal piglets","methods","immunohistochemistry","reduction of operation time","rise","member","exciting light","histopathologic lesions","paraffin","formalin","alkaline phosphatase","substrate chromogen","genus Alphacoronavirus","materials","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Pulmonary infection is the most common indication for performing chest radiography. Radiological imaging often confirms the diagnosis and allows the evaluation of the location and extent of infection. Chest radiography is the primary imaging procedure and the starting point for the evaluation of all children with acute chest disease. Accurate interpretation of pediatric chest films also requires a basic understanding of the physiologic and anatomic differences among adults, neonates, and infants and their most important differences will be referred. Characterization of pulmonary infiltrates is important, because patterns of abnormality suggest specific organisms and aetiologies. Although providing evidence suggestive of the causative agent, the chest radiograph cannot confirm viral infection, confirm or exclude bacterial etiology. In fact, in infancy, pneumonia usually produces a combination of alterations of the airspace and interstitium. However, some aspects may be useful in distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia. Close attention to CT technique is crucial for imaging evaluation of pneumonia in pediatric patients, namely those with persistent symptoms and/or progressive symptoms despite medical or surgical therapy, or in immunocompromised patients. CT with low radiation dose technique should be carefully performed in these cases. CT examination with IV contrast is very useful for the evaluation of complications of chest infection. Thoracic trauma in children is rare, only 4\u20136 % of children are hospitalized following severe trauma. Only a small number of children with trauma have thoracic injury (14 %), but the injuries tend to be of serious nature. About 25\u201350 % of thoracic trauma cases occur in combination with other trauma locations. Pulmonary contusion and lacerations, tracheobronchial injuries, pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are referred as the main consequences of trauma. The decision for the appropriate use of imaging techniques must consider the specific case under review. Chest radiography should be the initial screening method. The decision to use CT is determined by the nature of the trauma, the clinical circumstances, and the prediction of future revaluation, always taking into account the radiation dose applied to the child.","publish_time":"2014-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santos, Jos\u00E9 Fonseca","journal":"Pediatric Chest Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c6bd01e55c16093ce83d25bfc559672682c4029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121356.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest infection","chest radiography","trauma locations","thoracic trauma cases","severe trauma","imaging evaluation of pneumonia","Acute chest diseases","Pulmonary infection","CT technique","viral infection","main consequences of trauma","Accurate interpretation of pediatric chest films","evaluation of complications","Radiological imaging","bacterial pneumonia","CT examination","extent of infection","primary imaging procedure","pediatric patients","appropriate use of imaging techniques","Pulmonary contusion","small number of children","important differences","bacterial etiology","thoracic injury","decision","low radiation dose technique","Characterization of pulmonary infiltrates","clinical situations","progressive symptoms","tracheobronchial injuries","persistent symptoms","clinical circumstances","anatomic differences","combination of alterations","specific organisms","specific case","immunocompromised patients","traumatic etiology","serious nature","surgical therapy","basic understanding","patterns of abnormality","starting point","adults","esophageal rupture","pneumothorax","causative agent","lacerations","distinguishing","common indication","neonates","account","infants","Close attention","contrast","prediction of future revaluation","initial screening method","evidence suggestive","airspace","aetiologies","infancy","diagnosis","interstitium","review","aspects","fact"],"language":"en"},

The alveolar/capillary units and pneumocytes within the alveoli appear to be particularly sensitive to RT. Hypoxia may be important in the underlying physiology of RT-associated lung injury. The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03B2), plays an important role in the development of RT-induced fibrosis. The histopathological changes observed in the lung after RT are broadly characterized as diffuse alveolar damage. The interaction between pre-treatment PFTs and the risk of symptomatic lung injury is complex. Similarly, the link between changes in PFTs and the development of symptoms is uncertain. The incidence of symptomatic lung injury increases with increase in most dosimetric parameters. The mean lung dose (MLD) and V20 have been the most-often considered parameters. MLD might be a preferable metric since it considers the entire 3D dose distribution. Radiation to the lower lobes appears to be more often associated with clinical symptoms than is radiation to the upper lobes. This might be related to incidental cardiac irradiation. In pre-clinical models, there appears to be a complex interaction between lung and heart irradiation. TGF-\u03B2 has been suggested in several studies to predict for RT-induced lung injury, but the data are still somewhat inconsistent. Oral prednisone (Salinas and Winterbauer 1995), typically 40\u201360 mg daily for 1\u20132 weeks with a slow taper, is usually effective in treating pneumonitis. There are no widely accepted treatments for fibrosis.

The complexity of disease emergencies calls for the identification of often collaborative effective strategies, based on both science and proven practical experience, to reduce future threats. The H(5)N(1) avian influenza crisis has shown how crucial it is to address persistent global threats at the interface between humans, animals and ecosystems which requires (i) to strengthen animal and human health institutions and (ii) build strong partnerships among players who may have different perspectives on some issues and different levels of resources. To address the gaps in the animal health sector, OIE seeks to build member countries\u2019 capacities in policy design and good governance in animal health systems and Veterinary Services. At policy level, the OIE helps its members to enhance their credibility, both at the national and international level, by providing them with efficient tools, such as the strategic planning tools of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, with the objective to attract more commitment and more resources from their decision makers and partners. At good governance level, it provides science-based guidance that supports members in detecting, preventing and managing serious animal disease outbreaks through improved surveillance systems, strengthened laboratory networks and improved legislation. OIE promotes strong partnerships, notably with FAO and WHO, especially with regard to two topics that are getting currently a great attention and that require a strong multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels because of their social, economical and ecological determinants: rabies in humans that still kills more than 50,000 persons every year, mainly in Asia and mostly youngsters, and that is believed to be totally preventable through effective dog vaccination, and antimicrobial resistance that can hinder the effective treatment and recovery of illnesses in both humans and animals. At regional level and in full collaboration with ASEAN and other partners, the OIE Sub-Regional Representation (OIESRR) for Southeast Asia plays a significant role in regional coordination of animal health and emerging infectious disease management in a region that is often considered as a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for emergence. Along the strategic objectives of the OIE Fifth Strategic Plan, the implementation of its activities to achieve the OIE Strategic Objectives is supported by various programmes and projects funded by donors. Its long-standing flagship regional programme, the Southeast Asia and China Foot-and-Mouth Disease (SEACFMD) Campaign which aims at controlling FMD by 2020 through vaccination promotes socio-economical and participatory approaches as well as assessment of the role of wildlife.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouchot, Alexandre; Bordier, Marion","journal":"Socio-Ecological Dimensions of Infectious Diseases in Southeast Asia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f743acddccecbd620dd35789c2df5081be1b5712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121704.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Veterinary Services","Performance of Veterinary Services","FAO","ASEAN","OIE","OIE Fifth Strategic Plan","OIE Strategic Objectives"],"locations":["Asia","Southeast Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["animal health systems","animal health sector","animal origin","regional coordination of animal health","animal diseases","OIE Strategic Objectives","regional level","serious animal disease outbreaks","public health","OIE Sub-Regional Representation","humans","policy level","international level","fast-growing animal protein demand","good governance level","Southeast Asia","Mouth Disease","strong partnerships","human health institutions","strategic planning tools","emerging infectious disease management","effective dog vaccination","effective treatment","different levels of resources","complexity of disease emergencies","members","animals","long-standing flagship regional programme","strong multi-sectoral collaboration","improved surveillance systems","Performance of Veterinary Services","collaborative effective strategies","science-based guidance","policy design","improved legislation","different perspectives","significant role","socio-economical","future threats","role of wildlife","efficient tools","international trade of products","persistent global threats","member countries\u2019 capacities","world","deforestation","laboratory networks","interface","OIESRR","food security","various programmes","antimicrobial resistance","China Foot","PVS","livelihoods","ecological determinants","identification","issues","impact","activities","proven practical experience","participatory approaches","recovery of illnesses","avian influenza crisis","assessment","Campaign","Pathway","rabies","players","implementation","ASEAN","decision makers","projects","donors","commitment","great attention","SEACFMD","FAO","ecosystems","re-emerging","gaps","topics","regard","credibility","persons","year","hotspot","emergence","youngsters"],"language":"en"},

Most of the genes for CLRs are clustered in human chromosome 12 close to the natural killer gene complex. Similar to the killer lectin-like receptors whose genes are clustered in this complex, most of the CLRs induce activating or regulatory signal cascades in response to distinct pathogen- or self-derived components, through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating or inhibitory motif, respectively. In this chapter, some representative CLRs are picked up and their structural features leading to the functional consequences are discussed, especially on the signaling cascades and pathogen interactions, including some impacts on cutaneous pathophysiology.

The robustness of such filters lies in the variety and the quality of the data used to train them. There is, therefore, a need for a tool that automatically generates fake but realistic news. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that automatically generates news headlines. The model is trained with a corpus of existing headlines from different topics. Once trained, the model generates a fake but realistic headline given a seed and a topic. For example, given the seed \u201CKim Jong Un\u201D and the topic \u201CBusiness\u201D, the model generates the headline \u201Ckim jong un says climate change is already making money\u201D. In order to better capture and leverage the syntactic structure of the headlines for the task of synthetic headline generation, we extend the architecture - Contextual Long Short Term Memory, proposed by Ghosh et al. - to also learn a part-of-speech model. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a real corpora of headlines. We compare our proposed approach and its variants using Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units as the building blocks. We evaluate and compare the topical coherence of the generated headlines using a state-of-the-art classifier. We, also, evaluate the quality of the generated headline using a machine translation quality metric and its novelty using a metric we propose for this purpose.

Binding of IFNs to their receptors activates the JAK/STAT signalling pathway with the Janus kinases JAK1, 2 and TYK2 and the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. Depending on the cellular setting, additional STATs (STAT3-6) and additional signalling pathways are activated. The actions of IFNs on infected cells and the surrounding tissue are mediated by the induction of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Since the cloning of the first ISGs, considerable progress has been made in describing antiviral effector proteins and their many modes of action. Effector proteins individually target distinct steps in the viral life cycle, including blocking virus entry, inhibition of viral transcription and translation, modification of viral nucleic acids and proteins and, interference with virus assembly and budding. Novel pathways of viral inhibition are constantly being elucidated and, additionally, unanticipated functions of known antiviral effector proteins are discovered. Herein, we outline IFN-induced antiviral pathways and review recent developments in this fascinating area of research.","publish_time":"2012-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strobl, Birgit; Leitner, Nicole R.; M\u00FCller, Mathias","journal":"Jak-Stat Signaling : From Basics to Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46bc0c7518117059b9dc815550b5c18fcf3f2d09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK/STAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral effector proteins","inhibition of viral transcription","viral infections","antiviral pathways","Novel pathways of viral inhibition","viral life cycle","additional signalling pathways","modification of viral nucleic acids","actions of IFNs","Binding of IFNs","ISGs","STAT signalling pathway","activators of transcription","virus assembly","additional STATs","blocking virus entry","IFN-stimulated genes","translation","TYK2","STAT3","interference","distinct steps","Janus kinases JAK1","recent developments","infected cells","host defence","powerful cytokines","receptors","surrounding tissue","signal transducer","induction","cellular setting","unanticipated functions","fascinating area of research","budding","considerable progress","modes of action","cloning","Interferons","STAT2"],"language":"en"},

Rarely, completely new influenza viruses can emerge in human populations, giving rise to influenza pandemics. Children aged \u003C5 years (especially those \u003C2 years) and those with underlying illness such as cardiac, respiratory and severe neurologic disease have an increased risk of severe outcomes associated with influenza. Pregnant women have an increased risk of severe influenza. Complications may involve the respiratory tract (e.g. otitis media or pneumonia) or, less commonly, other organ systems (e.g. encephalitis or myocarditis). Specific antiviral treatment should be offered as soon as possible for hospitalized children with presumed or confirmed influenza and for influenza of any severity for children at high risk of severe complications of influenza without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Antiviral treatment is usually not warranted for uncomplicated influenza as this is usually self-limiting. Annual influenza vaccination should be offered to all individuals at increased risk for complications of influenza.

In this paper, we introduce the average neighborhood size as a new measure for the degree of being small-world and utilize it to formally define the de-small-world network problem. We also prove the NP-hardness of the general reachable pair cut problem and propose a greedy edge betweenness based approach as the benchmark in selecting the candidate edges for solving our problem. Furthermore, we transform the de-small-world network problem as an OR-AND Boolean function maximization problem, which is also an NP-hardness problem. In addition, we develop a numerical relaxation approach to solve the Boolean function maximization and the de-small-world problem. Also, we introduce the short-betweenness, which measures the edge importance in terms of all short paths with distance no greater than a certain threshold, and utilize it to speed up our numerical relaxation approach. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Ruoming; Sheng, Yelong; Liu, Lin; Chen, Xue-Wen; Phan, NhatHai","journal":"Computational Data and Social Networks","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/009877fd1b9048c67a1df6422986856f62068f51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121964.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121964/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["de-small-world problem","de-small-world network problem","NP-hardness problem","Boolean function maximization problem","numerical relaxation approach","short-betweenness","context of network","greedy edge betweenness","edge importance","short paths","distance","new measure","terms","benchmark","general reachable pair","average neighborhood size","effectiveness","efficiency","degree","experimental evaluation","certain threshold","contact","candidate edges","important strategy","approaches","paper","outbreak","individuals","addition"],"language":"en"},

Phenotypic, developmental, and functional aspects of these cells in steady state and in different diseases are the focus of this review. Recently it has become evident that KC precursors seed the liver already early in fetal development, and the population can be maintained independently from circulating monocytes. However, inflammatory conditions allow rapid differentiation of monocytes into mature cells that are indistinguishable from genuine KC. KC are located in the lumen of sinusoids that receive blood both from the portal vein, carrying nutrients and microbial products from the gut, and from the hepatic artery. This positions KC ideally for their prime function, namely surveillance and clearance of the circulation. As such, they are important in iron recycling by phagocytosing effete erythrocytes, for instance. The immunophenotype of KC, characterized by a wide variety of endocytic receptors, is indicative of this scavenger function. In maintaining homeostasis, KC have an ambivalent response to exogenous triggers. On the one hand, their surveillance function requires alert responses to potentially hazardous substances. On the other hand, continuous exposure of the cells to the trigger-rich content of blood originating from the gut dampens their responsiveness to further stimuli. This ambivalence is also reflected in their diverse roles in disease pathogenesis. For the latter, we sketch the contribution of KC by giving examples of their role in metabolic disease, infections, and liver injury.","publish_time":"2014-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woltman, Andrea M.; Boonstra, Andre; Naito, Makoto; Leenen, Pieter J.

Therefore, the need for alternative solutions is crucial. Thus, short peptide vaccine candidates promise effective answers under such circumstances. Short peptide vaccine candidates are linear T-cell epitopes (antigenic determinants that are recognized by the immune system) that specifically function by binding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles of different ethnicities (including Black, Caucasian, Oriental, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Australian aboriginal, and mixed ethnicities). The population-specific allele-level HLA sequence data in the public IMGT/HLA database contains approximately 12542 nomenclature defined class I (9437) and class II (3105) HLA alleles as of March 2015 present in several ethnic populations. The bottleneck in short peptide vaccine design and development is HLA polymorphism on the one hand and viral diversity on the other hand. Hence, a crucial step in its design and development is HLA allele-specific binding of short antigen peptides. This is usually combinatorial and computationally labor intensive. Mathematical models utilizing structure-defined pockets are currently available for class I and class II HLA-peptide-binding peptides. Frameworks have been developed to design protocols to identify the most feasible short peptide cocktails as vaccine candidates with superantigen properties among known HLA supertypes. This approach is a promising solution to develop new viral vaccines given the current advancement in T-cell immuno-informatics, yet challenging in terms of prediction efficiency and protocol development.","publish_time":"2015-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kangueane, Pandjassarame; Sowmya, Gopichandran; Anupriya, Sadhasivam; Dangeti, Sandeep Raja; Mathura, Venkatrajan S.; Sakharkar, Meena K.","journal":"Global Virology I - Identifying and Investigating Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d727c328f28787cdf5baeccc04fe00062c17869d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HLA-peptide","HLA alleles","short peptide vaccine candidates","HLA polymorphism","Vaccine development","HLA database","short peptide vaccine design","class","HLA allele-specific binding of short antigen peptides","known HLA supertypes","feasible short peptide cocktails","protocol development","binding peptides","population-specific allele-level HLA sequence data","new viral vaccines","viral diseases","viral diversity","hand","alleles of different ethnicities","linear T-cell epitopes","T-cell immuno-informatics","subunit vaccines","mixed ethnicities","crucial step","human leukocyte antigen","structure-defined pockets","current advancement","superantigen properties","Pacific Islander","American Indian","Australian aboriginal","public IMGT","Caucasian","challenge","effective answers","Oriental","antigenic determinants","promising solution","terms of prediction efficiency","Mathematical models","bottleneck","need","alternative solutions","circumstances","protocols","nomenclature","ethnic populations","approach","immune system","Frameworks"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern repertoire expressed at the microbial surface determines the interactions with specific receptors (Fig. 42.1). Secondly, each immune cell type possesses a specific set of pathogen-recognition receptors. Thirdly, changes in the cell-surface distribution of C-type lectins regulate carbohydrate binding by modulating receptor affinity for different ligands. Crosstalk between these receptors results in a network of multimolecular complexes, adding a further level of complexity in pathogen recognition (Cambi and Figdor 2005; Thiel et al. 2006) (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_23). MBL deficiency is genetically determined and predisposes to recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. MBL deficiency has been implicated in susceptibility and course of viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infection. More than 10% of the general population may, depending on definition, be classified as MBL deficient, underlining the redundancy of the immune system. MBL-disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research, which implicates a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes.

Although the immune response is associated with beneficial effects at the site of injury including the elimination of exogenous and endogenous danger molecules as well as the initiation of regenerative processes, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response significantly contributes to posttraumatic complications such as multiple organ failure (MOF) and early death. Besides pre-existing physical conditions, age, gender, and underlying comorbidities, surgical and anesthesiological management after injury is decisive for outcome. Improvements in surgical intensive care have increased number of patients who survive the initial phase after trauma. However, instead of progressing to normal recovery, patients often pass into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). The characterization and management of PICS will require new strategies for direct monitoring and therapeutic intervention into the patient\u2019s immune function.

Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic micro-organisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself. The manipulation of cell cultures from human or primate origin necessitates the use of a type II biosafety cabinet. The scope of this chapter is to highlight aspects relevant for the risk assessment and to summarize the main biosafety recommendations and the recent technological advances allowing a mitigation of the risk for the handling of animal cell cultures.","publish_time":"2014-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herman, Philippe; Pauwels, Katia","journal":"Animal Cell Culture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710171d99a72ecec627a8bdea3a4d2a113b58819.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["manipulation of cell cultures","handling of animal cell cultures","biosafety measures","biosafety concerns","biosafety cabinet","containment measures","thorough risk assessment","main biosafety recommendations","risks","tissue culture","type of manipulation prior","infectious etiologic agent","human health","adventitious contaminants","case evaluation","pathogenic micro-organisms","adventitious contamination","scientific research","recent technological advances","use","primate origin","diagnosis","mitigation","intrinsic properties","better capacity","biotechnological activities","lesser extent","start","aspects relevant","environment","cells","compliance","chapter","unfavourable conditions","hazard","activity","century","beginning","management","steps","development","scope","probability"],"language":"en"},

Large-scale nationwide epidemiological studies have displayed an increased prevalence of both autoimmune diseases and infections among persons with schizophrenia and depression. Autoimmune diseases, and especially the number of infections requiring hospitalization, increase the risk of schizophrenia and depression in a dose\u2013response relationship. Infections are a common exposure and a broad spectrum of infections are associated with schizophrenia and depression. Particularly the autoimmune diseases with a potential presence of brain-reactive antibodies were associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the associations seem to be bidirectional, since the risk of autoimmune diseases and infections is also increased after diagnosis with schizophrenia and depression. The risk of autoimmune diseases was particularly increased in individuals with prior hospital contacts for infections. It has been suggested that inflammation and autoimmunity could be involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of some patients with symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. The psychiatric symptoms can be directly triggered by immune components, such as brain-reactive antibodies and cytokines, or infections reaching the central nervous system (CNS), or be secondary to systemic inflammation indirectly affecting the brain. However, the associations could also be caused by shared genetic factors, other environmental factors, or common etiological components. Nonetheless, autoimmune diseases and infections should be considered by clinicians in the treatment of individuals with psychiatric symptoms, since treatment would probably improve the psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and the survival of the individuals.","publish_time":"2015-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benr\u00F3s, Michael Eriksen; Mortensen, Preben B.","journal":"Immunology and Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d02a6e61165f50c90d0cc8e22bc536c4f82d350d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["depression","risk of autoimmune diseases","number of infections","symptoms of schizophrenia","risk of schizophrenia","psychiatric symptoms","broad spectrum of infections","associations","treatment of individuals","psychiatric disorders","brain-reactive antibodies","increased prevalence","potential presence of brain","common etiological components","environmental factors","common exposure","genetic factors","immune components","systemic inflammation","cytokines","patients","persons","central nervous system","Large-scale nationwide epidemiological studies","CNS","quality of life","prior hospital contacts","dose","hospitalization","etiology","survival","pathogenesis","response relationship","extensive research","immunologic component","clinicians","diagnosis","autoimmunity"],"language":"en"},

It is these leadership roles of corporate communicators that highlight their importance both internally and externally in protecting, maintaining and enhancing the company\u2019s reputation. It also conditions the relationship of corporate communicators with those executives who have primary responsibility for critical programmes, such as investor and government relations, where corporate communicators have a secondary role. It is the task of corporate communicators working as a team with directors and senior managers to formulate and agree a coherent narrative that best represents the company\u2019s activities, aspirations and strategy.

The stress response is normally adaptive and time limited and improves the chances of the individual for survival. The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiologic actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function and the immune system. Cortisol increase the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors which is partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils at sites of inflammation. Cortisol is the most important inhibitor of the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators (inhibits NF-kB and AP-1 by multiple mechanisms) [1].","publish_time":"2014-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marik, Paul Ellis","journal":"Evidence-Based Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8de20e0e2d6a12897a8c24b46951cde12237373f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cortisol effects","release of cortisol","Cortisol levels","graded cortisol response","stress response","stress system","cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function","immune system","degree of stress","cardiovascular function","addition","function of various immune cells","important physiologic actions","positive inotropic effects","central nervous system","transcription of thousands","important inhibitor","multiple mechanisms","potent anti-inflammatory actions","non-transcriptional mechanisms","transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators","number","neutrophils","monocytes","reduction","metabolism","Glasgow Coma Scale","HPA","eosinophils","B lymphocytes","axis","genes","peripheral somatic signals","hypothalamic-pituitary","severity of injury","diversity of cognitive","time limited","chances","catecholamine receptors","adrenal","APACHE score","distinct pathways","synthesis of catecholamines","activation","sites of inflammation","individual","survival","body","type of surgery"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the long evolutionary histories of retrotransposons are presumed not to have included infectious ancestors. With the characterization of the Gypsy retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster as an infectious, endogenous retrovirus, these distinctions have blurred. A number of plant LTR retroelements possess coding regions whose conceptual translations produce hypothetical proteins with predicted structural elements found in viral envelope proteins, and the term endogenous retrovirus began to be applied to these elements. The question of whether any of the many plant retroelement genes now annotated as \u201Cenv-like\u201D generate proteins that have or had envelope functions remains unanswered.

Risk factors for infection and illness may be intrinsic (e.g. postexercise suppression of the immune system, recent acute illness, female gender) and extrinsic (e.g. training load, nutrition, resting periods). Fever during illness contributes to systemic symptoms such as headache and myalgia but also to dehydration, muscle breakdown and reduction in cardiometabolic function. The consequences of exercise during illnesses may be aggravation of illness, loss of muscle strength and endurance, cardiac complications, transmission of infection to others, neurological dysfunctions including coordination problems, rhabdomyolysis and in the worst case sudden death. Recommendations for safe return to sport include clearance of infection allowing full recovery and thereafter gradual progress of exercise volume combined with monitoring of remaining symptoms of illness. Different actions can be taken to prevent acquiring, aggravating and spreading of infections by the athlete (e.g. hygiene, physical contact, covering of the body, sharing of equipment, nutrition), the coaches (e.g. individualised plan of training, competition, nutrition, recovery and recovery measures) and the physicians (monitor and implement illness prevention, identify and arrange for high-risk athletes, educate athletes and staff).","publish_time":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6rjesson, Mats; Arvidsson, Daniel; Rensburg, Christa Janse Van; Schwellnus, Martin","journal":"Return to Play in Football","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d330660227097892df55473548d5ec4aa4f2af0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aggravation of illness","illness prevention","recent acute illness","monitoring of remaining symptoms of illness","nutrition","performance of athletes","high-risk athletes","recovery measures","sufficient recovery","Acute illnesses","safe sports participation","transmission of infection","clearance of infection","recommendations","negative consequences of sports participation","consequences of exercise","Sports medicine physicians","risk factors","coaches","muscle breakdown","training load","systemic symptoms","safe return","loss of muscle strength","individualised plan of training","gradual progress of exercise volume","rhabdomyolysis","immune system","endurance","cardiac complications","female gender","competition","neurological dysfunctions","reduction","dehydration","postexercise suppression","myalgia","significant concern","challenge","coordination problems","hygiene","physical contact","worst case sudden death","cardiometabolic function","headache","body","health","evidence","demands","infections","equipment","periods","Fever","staff","acquiring","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The changes in the immune system that accompany human aging are very complex and are generally referred to as immunosenescence. The factors and mechanisms of immunosenescence are multiple and include, among others, defects in the bone marrow, thymic involution, and intrinsic defects in the formation, maturation, homeostasis, and migration of peripheral lymphocytes. Aging affects both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The process of aging is commonly accompanied by low-grade inflammation thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and to many age-related diseases. Numerous attempts to define the role of chronic inflammation in aging have implicated chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, immunosenescence, epigenetic modifications, and other phenomena. Several lifestyle strategies, such as intervening to provide an adequate diet and physical and mental activity, have been shown to result in improved immune and neuroprotective functions, a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a potential increase in individual longevity. The studies published thus far describe a critical role for nutrition in maintaining the immune response of the aged, but they also indicate the need for a more in-depth, holistic approach to determining the optimal nutritional and behavioral strategies that would maintain immune and other physiological systems in elderly people. In this chapter, we focus first on the age-related changes of the immune system.

In particular, continuous-time Markov chain models are used to investigate epidemic features associated with the presence of superspreaders in a population. We parameterize the models for two case studies, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the probability of outbreaks increases and time to outbreaks decreases as the prevalence of superspreaders increases in the population.

In Sontag\u2019s terms, \u201Cmetaphor\u201D mainly refers to the symbolic social oppression of the diseases. For example, cancer is a metaphor for the defect of the sick person in personality.

This chapter provides an overview on the synthesis of inorganic fibers through polymer-mediated electrospinning. Some of the common techniques employed by many researchers, such as solgel combined with electrospinning, emulsion electrospinning, and electrospinning combined with solid\u2013gas reaction, to fabricate metal oxide fibers are discussed. In addition, techniques to fabricate ceramic and metal oxide fibers having different morphologies and hierarchical structures are described. Recent applications of electrospun metal oxide fibers are finally highlighted with a focus on filtration, sensors, photocatalysis, and energy.","publish_time":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baji, Avinash; Mai, Yiu-Wing","journal":"Polymer-Engineered Nanostructures for Advanced Energy Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2446eeccd4d3898f35b432c956d3c7892b4af04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123404.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["one-dimensional fibers","synthesis of inorganic fibers","emulsion electrospinning","Recent applications of electrospun metal oxide fibers","polymer-mediated electrospinning","energy harvesting","energy storage","inorganic materials","sensors","unique features","common techniques","conventional materials","large surface area","high porosity","volume ratio","different morphologies","super-hydrophobic membranes","gas reaction","controlled sizes","hierarchical structures","photocatalysis","focus","overview","straightforward technique","solgel","low density","researchers","filtration","chapter","addition"],"language":"en"},

Zoonoses are diseases naturally transmitted between animals and man and comprise in total about 80% of all described human infections. Attempts have been made to define different classes of zoonoses according to the man-animal relationship but generally this does not seem to have been accepted. Elton in 1927 stressed the field of wild animal pathology was still virtually untouched, and in 1968 McDiarmid reiterated the view that it remained one of the most neglected aspects of animal ecology. There is now an extensive literature but it is rarely incorporated into ecological texts although disease is often the driving force in population dynamics. The primary driver of infectious disease dynamics is transmission between individuals, yet in most important respects remarkably little is known about the subject (Craft et al. 2008, Haydon 2008). Occasionally, under high population densities, an organism may infect a host outside of its normal range with highly pathogenic effect in its adventitious host.","publish_time":"2011-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spinage, Clive A.","journal":"African Ecology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Elton","McDiarmid"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["man-animal relationship","population dynamics","medical terminology of animal diseases","field of wild animal pathology","neglected aspects of animal ecology","adventitious host","primary driver of infectious disease dynamics","high population densities","different classes of zoonoses","individuals","pathogenic effect","transmission","driving force","normal range","organism","animals","ecological texts","subject","Craft","Haydon","McDiarmid","important respects","zoonosis","total","human infections","extensive literature","view","definition","Attempts","Elton"],"language":"en"},

Drugs may induce specific respiratory reactions, or the lungs may be affected as part of a generalized response. Drug-induced lung injury (DLI) can involve the airways, lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura, pulmonary vasculature, and/or the neuromuscular system. The most common form of DLI is drug-induced interstitial lung disease. There are no disease types specific to DLI, and DLIs are diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, chest CT images, and histopathologic findings. The first principle of management of DLI is early detection and cessation of treatment with the suspected drug. Response to corticosteroid therapy depends on the histopathologic pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Prognosis depends on the specific drug and underlying clinical, physiologic, and pathologic severity of lung disease. To minimize DLI morbidity and mortality, all health-care providers should be familiar with the possible adverse effects of medications they prescribe. Individual variability in drug response is an important concern in clinical practice and drug development. Such variability is multifactorial and includes extrinsic factors such as environmental features and genetic and intrinsic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Homma, Sakae","journal":"Drug-Induced Lung Injury","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/814e9621637e57466c7d3ccd8e69d4d1b4b5bdf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123618.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123618/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DLI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific drug","drug response","drug development","suspected drug","Drug-induced lung injury","interstitial lung disease","histopathologic pattern of drug","DLI morbidity","lung parenchyma","pathologic severity of lung disease","disease types specific","common form of DLI","clinical practice","basis of clinical findings","histopathologic findings","lungs","generalized response","specific respiratory reactions","intrinsic factors","extrinsic factors","Individual variability","pharmacodynamics of drugs","important concern","chest CT images","environmental features","mediastinum","large surface area","early detection","cessation of treatment","health-care providers","toxins","mortality","pleura","metabolic site","possible adverse effects of medications","pulmonary vasculature","pharmacokinetics","corticosteroid therapy","DLIs","airways","principle of management","substances","Prognosis","neuromuscular system"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines are available against both viral and bacterial infections; they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so. The World Health Organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a year old against most infectious diseases by 2020. The history of the public\u2019s acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one. Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the present. An example of this is the fabricated information spread about the relationship between measles vaccine and autism. A successful polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups, led by Koprowski, Salk and Sabin, although each of these vaccines has its advantages and disadvantages. An oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration and a herd effect. Polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in Nigeria and Pakistan. Recently, recombinant DNA technology, was used to develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects, since live virus is not involved. The future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants, allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution.","publish_time":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Milton W.","journal":"Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69edb43430f6add241fe9ca2e7fe7c8fe6b933c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["production of vaccines","new vaccines","measles vaccine","smallpox vaccine","oral vaccine","public\u2019s acceptance of vaccines","Polio vaccine workers","successful polio vaccine","children","multitudinous infectious diseases","cheap production","advantage of ease","government-mandated vaccination","Anti-vaccination movements","diphtheria","scarlet fever","targets of extremists","whooping cough","creation","relationship","century","edible plants","groups","bacterial infections","administration","worldwide distribution","development","year old","fabricated information","effects","research","Koprowski","Salk","Nigeria","Pakistan","s thanks","herd effect","Sabin","order","history","autism","recombinant DNA technology","World Health Organization","miracles of modern medicine","live virus","millions of lives","example","disadvantages","population","future"],"language":"en"},

The DPM model was employed to simulate the interaction between the continuous phase of the air and the discrete phase of pollution particles. Accordingly, the dispersion of sudden pollutants released in the ventilation shaft was investigated. The results show that the submicron particles have a good following performance with the air. The dispersion characteristics of the particles highly depend on the unsteady flow field in the tunnel, which is significantly affected by the piston effect induced by the train motion. It can be concluded that particle diffusion experiences three stages: vertical forward and reverse diffusion in the wind shaft, vertical positive diffusion in the wind shaft, and longitudinal stable diffusion in the interval tunnel.

Among a multitude of studies that have demonstrated the usefulness of chemoinformatics tools to chemical and medicinal applications, herein we present indicative cases of five successful KNIME-based approaches. The first two studies include the risk assessment of nanoparticles (NPs) through the Enalos InSilicoNano platform, namely, (1) the prediction of the toxicity of iron oxide NPs and (2) the cellular uptake prediction of computationally designed NPs with the aid of reliable quantitative nanostructure\u2013activity relationships (QNAR) models. The third case study deals with the recognition of organic substances as corrosion inhibitors though the construction of predictive quantitative structure\u2013property relationships (QSPR) models with Enalos KNIME nodes. Finally, two more cases are briefly described and involve the accurate prediction of yellow fever inhibitors from the ChEMBL database and the de novo design of compounds with the reaction vectors methodology.

Neutrophil proteases also contribute to the amplification and resolution of inflammatory responses through defined proteolytic cleavage of mediators, cell surface receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins. In the blood and at mucosal surfaces, neutrophil serine proteases are regulated by serpins found in plasma and by non-serpin secreted inhibitors. Distinct mechanisms leading to neutrophil cell death have been described for the granule serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3. Granule leakage in neutrophils triggers death pathways mediated by cathepsin G and proteinase-3, and both proteases are tightly regulated by their inhibitor SERPINB1 in a cell intrinsic manner. Although stored in the same types of granules, neutrophil elastase does not significantly contribute to cell death following intracellular release from granules into the cytoplasm. However, heterozygous mutations in ELANE, the gene encoding elastase, are the cause of severe congenital neutropenia, a life-threatening condition characterized by the death of neutrophils at an early precursor stage in the bone marrow. This chapter focuses on recent work exploring the biology of clade B intracellular serpins that inhibit neutrophil serine proteases and their functions in neutrophil homeostasis and serine protease control at sites of inflammation.","publish_time":"2015-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benarafa, Charaf","journal":"The Serpin Family","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6fb56628d628ba833829da107b8b31f0cb1d993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Neutrophil proteases","neutrophil serine proteases","neutrophil elastase","Neutrophil granules","neutrophil cell death","neutrophil homeostasis","granule serine proteases","death of neutrophils","serine protease control","cell surface receptors","neutrophils triggers death pathways","cathepsin G","cell intrinsic manner","types of granules","proteinase","intracellular release","Granule leakage","biology of clade B intracellular serpins","defined proteolytic cleavage of mediators","functions","antimicrobial weapons","resolution of inflammatory responses","early precursor stage","life-threatening condition","central components","cause of severe congenital neutropenia","plasma","gene","amplification","mucosal surfaces","extracellular matrix proteins","recent work","sites of inflammation","inhibitor SERPINB1","non-serpin secreted inhibitors","innate immune system","bone marrow","ELANE","Distinct mechanisms","heterozygous mutations","blood","cytoplasm","chapter"],"language":"en"},

We first outline the significance and broader objectives behind research related to the subfield of primate infectious disease ecology and epidemiology. We then reveal how members of the genus Macaca, being among the most socioecologically flexible and invasive of all primate taxa, live under varying degrees of overlap with humans in anthropogenic landscapes. Thus, human-macaque interfaces may favor the bidirectional exchange of parasites. We then review studies that have isolated various types of parasites at human-macaque interfaces, using information from the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD: http://www.mammalparasites.org/). Finally, we elaborate on avenues through which the implementation of both novel conceptual frameworks (e.g., Coupled Systems, One Health) and quantitative network-based approaches (e.g., social and bipartite networks, agent-based modeling) may potentially address some of the critical gaps in our current knowledge of infectious disease ecology at human-primate interfaces.","publish_time":"2019-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balasubramaniam, Krishna N.; Sueur, C\u00E9dric; Huffman, Michael A.; MacIntosh, Andrew J.

Workplace traumatic events and responses most studied in physicians include exposure to injured and dying patients, medical errors and complications, bullying, disasters, and workplace violence. Developmental issues confer specific risks for medical students and residents, as well as early and late career physicians. Prevention measures which reduce exposure to workplace trauma are optimal. Physicians exposed to traumatic events will benefit from the use of prompt, evidence-based interventions. Many will seek and benefit from self-help interventions and peer support, but some may need formal assessment and treatment through employee assistance programs and traditional psychiatric care. Effective prevention and treatment can enhance physician well-being and career retention as well as patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2017-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morganstein, Joshua C.; West, James C.; Ursano, Robert J.","journal":"Physician Mental Health and Well-Being","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3258b62afcd63c2a4898287b608847c690130870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Workplace traumatic events","treatment","exposure","late career physicians","workplace violence","benefit","behavioral effects","medical students","career retention","medical errors","psychiatric disorders","self-help interventions","Prevention measures","Effective prevention","traditional psychiatric care","evidence-based interventions","employee assistance programs","health risk behaviors","specific risks","sizable minority experience adverse psychological","physician well-being","previous functioning","residents","distress reactions","formal assessment","responses","Developmental issues","peer support","use of prompt","complications","disasters","individuals","patients","people","increased sense of efficacy","patient outcomes","point"],"language":"en"},

Impaired function of the immune system might lead to serious diseases which are often treated by immunomodulators. This chapter briefly explores the physiology of an important part of the lymphatic system, the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Currently used strategies for targeting GALT by immunomodulators for enhanced activity and/or decreased side effects are discussed. Strategies range from simple oral co-administration of immunomodulators with lipids to more advanced lipid-based formulations, polymer-based nanoparticle formulations and prodrugs. These targeting approaches successfully increase the concentration of immunomodulators achieved in the GALT and, more importantly, enhance immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, targeting immunomodulators to GALT represent a promising approach in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is actively involved.","publish_time":"2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zgair, Atheer; Wong, Jonathan Chi Man; Gershkovich, Pavel","journal":"Neuro-Immuno-Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ff014a8bda72130f2d8ba4a7984cca172bc4000.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123898.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GALT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune system","GALT","lymphatic system","concentration of immunomodulators","targeting","immune responses","lymphoid tissues","simple oral co-administration of immunomodulators","advanced lipid-based formulations","major host of immune cells","polymer-based nanoparticle formulations","lipid absorption","treatment of diseases","Strategies range","serious diseases","used strategies","immunomodulatory effects","lipids","promising approach","gut","fluid haemostasis","enhanced activity","addition","prodrugs","Impaired function","physiology","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In spite of antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis, reduced host defenses render the HSCT patient vulnerable to pulmonary and other infections in the early weeks and even months post-transplantation. This chapter suggests an integrative approach followed by a description of the most common pulmonary syndromes seen in HSCT patients, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). The high risk of developing pulmonary complications after HSCT necessitates a pre-transplant pulmonary workup. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are done prior to HSCT and include spirometry and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO). Low DLCO and alveolar\u2013arterial oxygen gradient on PFTs carry increased mortality post-HSCT. Decreased DLCO and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) \u003C 80 % are indicators of developing respiratory failure post-HSCT. Investigating new pulmonary complaints is challenging. All patients should undergo an extensive workup of new pulmonary findings, including dyspnea, cough, fever, and hypoxia. In the first 4\u20136 weeks post-HSCT, immunocompromised patients can develop bacterial pneumonia. Pathogens include gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas or Klebsiella), Staphylococcus aureus, and Nocardia. While chest X-rays could show typical lobar or multilobar opacities, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (noncontrast CT scans are adequate for workup of infectious processes) may yield additional characteristic findings (nodules, ground glass opacities, etc.). Fungal pneumonias, primarily aspergillus, can also develop in this early period. There is a very strong association between invasive Aspergillus pneumonia and neutropenia lasting more than 10 days. Viral pneumonia may develop as well in this patient population; however, it tends to occur later. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral pathogen, but with monitoring and preemptive therapy, the incidence has declined. Other viruses have emerged as pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus (see Chap. 17).","publish_time":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moulton, Bart; Barker, Alan F.","journal":"Blood and Marrow Transplant Handbook","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d03900288f2905204fd34429de12b7a3eef70e7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSCT patients","pulmonary complications","weeks post-HSCT","respiratory failure post-HSCT","HSCT patient vulnerable","common pulmonary syndromes","new pulmonary complaints","increased mortality post-HSCT","pre-transplant pulmonary workup","Viral pneumonia","Pulmonary function tests","extensive workup of new pulmonary findings","bacterial pneumonia","idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","invasive Aspergillus pneumonia","immunocompromised patients","cryptogenic organizing pneumonia","PFTs","months post-transplantation","Low DLCO","early weeks","Decreased DLCO","Pathogens","workup of infectious processes","common viral pathogen","multilobar opacities","chest X-rays","patient population","early period","additional characteristic findings","noncontrast CT scans","diffuse alveolar hemorrhage","bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","ground glass opacities","respiratory syncytial virus","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","arterial oxygen gradient","reduced host defenses","computed tomography","antifungal prophylaxis","Pseudomonas","monitoring","nodules","BOS","IPS","DAH","diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide","Klebsiella","antiviral","RSV","spirometry","neutropenia","cough","description","dyspnea","indicators","infections","strong association","Staphylococcus aureus","parainfluenza","gram-negative rods","expiratory volume","preemptive therapy","high risk","integrative approach","human metapneumovirus","incidence","spite of antibacterial","fever","FEV1","CMV","COP","chapter","Nocardia","hypoxia","Fungal pneumonias","Cytomegalovirus","days","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 to determine the impact of housing type, environmental, and air quality variables on calf respiratory score. A total of 29 facilities and 437 preweaned calves were evaluated. Calf facility temperature averaged 24.2\u00B0C (range 15.5 to 30.6\u00B0C) with a relative humidity of 21.5% (range 10 to 78%) and a heat index of 21.5\u00B0C (range 6 to 30.9\u00B0C). Temperature and airborne bacterial counts were greater in hutches as compared with individual and group pens (P \u003C 0.01). Humidity was similar for hutches and group pens, but greater than individual pens. Gram negative airborne bacterial counts were lowest in individual pens. No difference in heat index was observed across housing type. Mean calf respiratory scores was 2.5 (range of 0 to 9) on a 12 point scale; 13.33% of calves evaluated scored greater than 5, indicating a respiratory challenge. Prevalence of respiratory illness in preweaned calves ranged from 0 to 50% of calves on a per farm basis (mean = 11.05% of calves/farm), with 44.82% of farms having no respiratory illness and 10.32% of farms having 30 to 50% of evaluated calves exhibiting signs of respiratory illness. There was a negative correlation between respiratory score and pen temperature (R(2) = 0.90). There was no influence on respiratory score by housing system, bedding type, ventilation system, relative humidity, airflow, or airborne bacterial counts. Data collected from this study suggests that respiratory illness continues to be a challenge, even when weather is temperate. Additional research is needed to evaluate rates of respiratory illness during cold stress and transitional weather, as well as to evaluate management factors that increase the risk of infection.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morrill, K.

However, scant published research has reported the relationship between serum antibody titers to specific infectious agents in vaccinated cows, the colostrum of these cows, and the serum of calves consuming their colostrum. As part of a larger study, the relationship between cow serum and colostrum antibody titers and calf titers was evaluated. Fifty-four multiparous Jersey and Jersey-cross cows were vaccinated between dry-off and calving with commercially available vaccines containing bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli J-5, and Salmonella siderophore receptor and porin (SRP); blood was collected at dry off, mid-dry, and at calving. Calves born to enrolled cows were fed colostrum from only their dams; calf serum was collected at 7 and 30 d of life. Antibody titers against agents in the vaccine were measured in serum and colostrum of cows by standard neutralizing techniques or ELISA, and correlations between cow serum antibodies at 30 d before calving, cow colostrum, and calf serum antibodies at 7 d of life were evaluated. Correlations between cow serum antibodies and colostrum antibodies for different agents were significant (P \u003C 0.05) but only moderately strong (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] range: 0.32\u20130.7), and varied for different agents. Similarly, correlations between cow colostrum antibodies and calf serum antibodies were usually significant, but only moderate (PCC range: 0.36\u20130.77). The R(2) value for the correlation between colostrum antibodies and calf antibodies ranged from 0.11\u20130.59, indicating that for most agents, the colostrum antibody titer to a given agent did not explain a majority of variation in the calf serum antibody titer to that agent. Antibody titers to specific agents in cows are significantly, but not strongly, correlated with their colostrum antibody titers, and colostrum antibody titers are significantly but not strongly, related to antibody titers in calves. These data suggest that, in addition to maternal antibody concentration, other factors have an important impact on serum antibody titers to specific infectious agents in young dairy calves.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLean, D.

Moreover, most human infectious diseases are derived from animals, and zoonotic infections always spread on directed interconnected networks. So, in this article, we consider the epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections on a unidirectional circular-coupled network. Here, we construct two unidirectional three-layer circular interactive networks, one model has direct contact between interactive networks, the other model describes diseases transmitted through vectors between interactive networks, which are established by introducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method. Then we obtain the basic reproduction numbers and stability of equilibria of the two models. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that basic reproduction numbers of the models depend on the infection rates, infection periods, average degrees, and degree ratios. Numerical simulations illustrate and expand these theoretical results very well.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhongpu; Fu, Xinchu","journal":"Acta Math Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33fd6993e3de9822356ff75f381dabe109c1b3e9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interconnected networks","interrelated networks","layer circular interactive networks","kinds of complex networks","epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections","unidirectional circular","basic reproduction numbers","models","numerical simulations","Real epidemic","infection periods","infection rates","human infectious diseases","average degrees","direct contact","animals","stability of equilibria","different topologies","heterogeneous mean-field approach method","vectors","degree ratios","mathematical analysis","Lyme disease","theoretical results","article"],"language":"en"},

Through mutations and gene reassortment, some strains of avian influenza viruses establish stable lineages in poultry species, pigs, horses, and humans. The first zoonotic influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century, the swine H1N1 pandemic of 2009, originated from Mexico, and fortunately the virus was only of modest virulence. However, lessons have been learned on the shortcomings of the global preparedness for influenza pandemic, and this should be considered as a valuable experience for the preparation of the next major outbreak. Of more concern is the emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A [H5N1], ongoing since 1996, and the low pathogenic avian influenza A [H7N9], since 2013, which have crossed the species barrier to humans in China. Risks of a H5N1 pandemic appear to be receding with declining human cases, and the H7N9 influenza virus is now the leading candidate as the next pandemic influenza virus. However, influenza pandemics are unpredictable in their timing, specific strain of virus, and origin. Most experts predict that the next influenza pandemic will arise from Asia, especially China, and will be directly of avian origin. Continued influenza surveillance in animals and humans globally with prompt reporting to the WHO and the World Animal Health Organization with sharing of data promptly between countries is essential. Long-term solutions to prevent cross-species transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses to humans and development of more effective, longer-lasting vaccines against emerging avian influenza viruses are needed. Currently there is no evidence of an impending zoonotic or avian influenza pandemic, and the viruses of interest, H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza A viruses, have not mutated to allow for easy transmission to humans nor human to human.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong, I.

Relative uncertainty in 1kg is pretty small say one part in 10(9). However, gravitational force of an object of molecular scale is too feeble to detect. Hence, normal method of using a balance will not do for mass measurement on the microscopic scale. Measurement of mass at the microscopic scale is very vital as it serves powerful tool that can provide information about the molecular and atomic composition of an object, detection, prevention and treatment of various diseases. Mechanical balances with electronic devices can detect only up to 0.1\u03BCg. An alternate method to measure the mass of an object is to consider mass as quantification of inertia. This principle is used in mass spectroscopy. In this the trajectory of an ionised particle in a strong electromagnetic field provides a precise measure of the inertia of the particle and hence a measure of its mass. Mass spectroscopy is able to distinguish ionised particles that differ by a single atomic mass unit. One atomic mass unit is equal to 1.66 \u00D710(\u221227)kg. However, mass spectroscopy is restricted to ionised particles so it cannot be applied to all microscopic objects, which are neither in charged state nor can be charged. So for smaller masses, one has to depend upon certain other phenomenon.","publish_time":"2011-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, S.

At the conceptual heart of this model is presumption. Through its unique features of defeasibility, context sensitivity and much else besides, presumption, it was argued, is equipped to handle the full range of demands that uncertainty imposes on investigators during scientific inquiry. But presumption could not act alone in this endeavour. Several argument forms that have traditionally been characterized as fallacies became the vehicle through which presumption was given effect in a model of reasoning. These argument forms, it was contended, served to facilitate scientific inquiry when widespread uncertainty threatened to halt inquiry in its tracks. The purpose of this chapter will be to demonstrate in quite specific ways how certain of the fallacies achieved this facilitation in the case of scientific inquiry into BSE. The presumptive analyses of fallacies that have been advanced to date have certainly served to reveal rational features of the fallacies. These features have been largely obscured from view under traditionally dominant deductive and inductive conceptions of argument. To this extent, these analyses have helped to move the fallacies a bit further along the road towards full integration within cognitive rationality. But there are lingering suspicions amongst theorists that these argument forms, despite their demonstrated practical and other benefits in inquiry, may still not somehow fully warrant the type of rational legitimacy that routinely attends deductive and inductive modes of reasoning. In this chapter, I aim to dispel those suspicions once and for all by arguing in support of a clear role for the fallacies within cognitive rationality.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, Louise","journal":"Rethinking the BSE Crisis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bc0df7323863e4ded9f06c569693ed6b673b020.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presumption","argument forms","case of scientific inquiry","model of scientific reasoning","model of reasoning","presumptive analyses of fallacies","rational features","inductive conceptions of argument","inductive modes of reasoning","cognitive rationality","widespread uncertainty","contexts of uncertainty","chapter","unique features of defeasibility","lingering suspicions","type of rational legitimacy","facilitation","context sensitivity","clear role","place","view","road","theorists","effect","raw materials","integration","benefits","specific ways","conceptual heart","BSE","vehicle","investigators","support","date","stage of discussion","purpose","extent","range","tracks","endeavour"],"language":"en"},

It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein\u2019s model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread.

Recently, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) has been identified in pigs in the USA that is associated with porcine dermatitis nephropathy syndrome, acute myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation, etc. Genetic heterogeneity of PCV2 has been studied in Indian pig population. Different genotypes like PCV2a-2D, PCV2b-1C, PCV2d and recombinant strain between PCV2a-2C and PCV2b-1C are reported from different studies. PCV2 has been discovered in human faeces, human vaccines and beef. But its pathogenicity in humans is not clear. PCV detection is based on common golden standard techniques including nucleic acid and antigen detection in the tissues, in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using monoclonal or polyclonal antibody against PCV2, respectively. The commercial vaccines available are effective in reducing the severity of clinical diseases and improving production parameters. Recently, antiviral compounds have also shown promising results against PCV2.

Furthermore, Contracting States are required to develop procedures for the pre-arrival and pre-departure lodgement of an import and export goods declaration to enable expeditious release/clearance of the goods. Where the nature of a consignment could attract the attention of different public authorities, e.g. the customs, veterinary or sanitary controllers, Contracting States shall endeavour to delegate authority for release/clearance to customs or one of the other agencies or, where that is not feasible, take all necessary steps to ensure that release/clearance is coordinated and, if possible, carried out simultaneously and with a minimum of delay. Contracting States are not normally expected to require the physical examination of cargo to be imported or exported and are required to use risk management to determine which goods shall be examined and the extent of that examination. Where practicable, and with a view to improving efficiency, modern screening or examination techniques are required to be used to facilitate the physical examination of goods to be imported or exported.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abeyratne, Ruwantissa","journal":"Law and Regulation of Air Cargo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11bdf62c9d6a5ae4a138c985cc414bdfa6c98f95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICAO","Council","International Civil Aviation"],"locations":["Chicago Convention"],"keyphrases":["States","clearance of goods","air cargo operations","physical examination of goods","physical examination of cargo","air waybill","expeditious release","regulations","Annex","export goods declaration","Chicago Convention","procedures appropriate","examination techniques","customs","Standards","Facilitation","Recommended Practices","manner","pre-arrival","provisions of Article","pre-departure lodgement","import","efficiency","modern screening","attention of different public authorities","surface transport","International Civil Aviation","parties","consult","sanitary controllers","title","authority","necessary steps","consignment","aircraft operators","Chapter","respect","aim","unnecessary delays","Council","actions","risk management","extent","purview of ICAO","minimum of delay","nature","agencies"],"language":"en"},

Endophytes are extremely diverse and range from fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. Development of drug resistance to pathogenic forms of bacteria, fungi and other microbes, emergence of lethal viruses, the perpetuating epidemics in developing and under developing countries, and multifold fungal infection, enhancement in human population globally, all shows our inability to overcome these biomedical problems. In addition to this, we are also unable to assure people towards enough food security in specific regions of the earth due to infestation of different plant diseases. Since the fungal endophytes are relatively less studied group of microbial flora, but are responsible for several prospects such as biodiversity, ecology, bioactive metabolites (metabolomics) and nanotechnology, may enable us to overcome the above mentioned problems. Fungal endophytes represent a dependable source of specific secondary metabolites and can be manipulated both physicochemically and genetically to increase yield of desired compounds and to produce novel analogues of active metabolites. In this chapter, we have discussed several bioactive compounds and classified them in to different classes as per their properties such as antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial, anticancer, antioxidants, antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents derived from fungal endophytes with their hosts and made the chemical structures for 73 compounds using chemdraw 3D ultra version 7.0. These bioactive products are related to human health with MIC/EC/IC(50) values less that 50 \u03BCg/mL. This article also discusses nematicidal, some antimicrobial volatile compounds (VOCs) that are related to plant protection and faecal disposal. Therefore, this chapter is not very specific and covers almost prospects of fungal endophytes which could be useful in biodiversity, agrochemicals, biotechnology, biomedical and nanotechnology in ecofriendly manner.","publish_time":"2011-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Kumar, Anuj; Sharma, Vijay K.; Verma, Satish K.; Kharwar, R.

Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy, and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM. Finally, we review chemical biology-based experimental approaches for identifying autophagy regulatory pathways that may have implications for the development of therapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nedelsky, Natalia; Kuballa, Petric; Castoreno, Adam B.; Xavier, Ramnik J.","journal":"Molecular Genetics of Inflammatory Bowel Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6d30f7de1b1c0a6a93d31ec2ff7d8cc01709caf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selective autophagy","process of autophagy","studies of IBD","autophagy regulatory pathways","links autophagy-related genes","possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis","immune-specific functions","possible pathogenic mechanisms","nonselective process of degradation","present evidence","Crohn\u2019s disease","lysosome-based degradation pathway","inflammatory bowel disease","associated risk alleles of ATG16L1","mitophagy","xenophagy","experimental approaches","antigen presentation","secretion","maintenance of intestinal homeostasis","CD","implications","cytosolic contents","basic molecular events","ulcerative colitis","IRGM","inflammasome regulation","key roles","UC","chemical biology","human genetics","development of therapeutics","loci","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Noroviruses (NoVs) are a group of genetically diverse RNA viruses that cause the great majority of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. However, there is still no vaccine licensed for human use to prevent NoV GE. The lack of a tissue culture system and a small animal model further hinders the development of NoV vaccines. Virus-like particles (VLPs) that mimic the antigenic architecture of authentic virions, however, can be produced in insect, mammalian, and plant cells by the expression of the capsid protein. The particulate nature and high-density presentation of viral structure proteins on their surface render VLPs as a premier vaccine platform with superior safety, immunogenicity, and manufacturability. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the development of effective NoV vaccines based on VLPs of capsid proteins. The expression and structure of NoV VLPs, especially VLPs of Norwalk virus, the prototype NoV, are extensively discussed. The ability of NoV VLPs in stimulating a potent systemic and mucosal anti-NoV immunity through oral and intranasal delivery in mice is presented. The advantages of plant expression systems as a novel production platform for VLP-based NoV vaccines are discussed in light of their cost-effectiveness, production speed, and scalability. Recent achievements from the first successful demonstration of NoV VLP production in plant expression system under the current Good Manufacture Practice (cGMP) regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are detailed. Moreover, results of human clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of insect and plant-derived NoV VLPs are also presented. Due to the diversity of capsid protein among different NoV strains and its rapid antigenic drift, we speculate that vaccine development should focus on multivalent VLP vaccines derived from capsid proteins of the most prevalent strains. With the very recent approval of the first plant-made biologics by the FDA, we also speculate that plant-based production systems will play an important role in manufacturing such multivalent VLP-based NoV vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qiang","journal":"Molecular Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a290424b872b5e500f3c7785f1af79c04af222c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122369.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GE","US Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VLPs of capsid proteins","VLP production","plant-based production systems","plant-derived","multivalent VLP vaccines","plant cells","multivalent VLP-based","VLPs of Norwalk virus","advantages of plant expression systems","surface render VLPs","vaccine development","production speed","novel production platform","diversity of capsid protein","premier vaccine platform","development of effective","FDA","high-density presentation of viral structure proteins","superior safety","efficacy of insect","prevalent strains","human use","Recent achievements","recent approval","tissue culture system","rapid antigenic drift","great majority of nonbacterial gastroenteritis","results of human clinical trials","antigenic architecture of authentic virions","immunity","regulation","cGMP","current Good Manufacture Practice","US Food","small animal model","successful demonstration","important role","group","immunogenicity","light","diverse RNA viruses","intranasal delivery","particulate nature","Drug Administration","humans","cost-effectiveness","associated diarrheal diseases","mice","lack","manufacturability","scalability","mammalian","prototype","causes of death","world","Noroviruses","NoVs","chapter","biologics","particles"],"language":"en"},

The dynamic aspects of protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013ligand interactions are closely related to their biological functions and can be efficiently studied by using proteins residue selectively labeled with amino acids bearing optimized labeling patterns, prepared by cellular expression.

As DCGs are formed, the secretory pathway can also give rise to other types of vesicles, such as those bound for endosomes, lysosomes, and the cell surface. DCGs differ from these other vesicular carriers in both content and function, storing highly concentrated cores\u2019 of condensed cargo in vesicles that are stably maintained within the cell until a specific extracellular stimulus causes their fusion with the plasma membrane. These unique features are imparted by the activities of membrane and lumenal proteins that are specifically delivered to the vesicles during synthesis. This chapter will describe the DCG biogenesis pathway, beginning with the sorting of DCG proteins from proteins that are destined for other types of vesicle carriers. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), sorting occurs as DCG proteins aggregate, causing physical separation from non-DCG proteins. Recent work addresses the nature of interactions that produce these aggregates, as well as potentially important interactions with membranes and membrane proteins. DCG proteins are released from the TGN in vesicles called immature secretory granules (ISGs). The mechanism of ISG formation is largely unclear but is not believed to rely on the assembly of vesicle coats like those observed in other secretory pathways. The required cytosolic factors are now beginning to be identified using in vitro systems with purified cellular components. ISG transformation into a mature fusion-competent, stimulus-dependent DCG occurs as endoproteolytic processing of many DCG proteins causes continued condensation of the lumenal contents. At the same time, proteins that fail to be incorporated into the condensing core are removed by a coat-mediated budding mechanism, which also serves to remove excess membrane and membrane proteins from the maturing vesicle. This chapter will summarize the work leading to our current view of granule synthesis, and will discuss questions that need to be addressed in order to gain a more complete understanding of the pathway.","publish_time":"2010-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bowman, Grant R.; Cowan, Andrew T.; Turkewitz, Aaron P.","journal":"Trafficking Inside Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e95682bea27b726c5a598d3b49cfe454a12d9f39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCG","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane proteins","sorting of DCG proteins","DCG proteins aggregate","non-DCG proteins","lumenal proteins","DCG biogenesis pathway","stimulus-dependent DCG","activities of membrane","eukaryotic secretory pathway","plasma membrane","excess membrane","DCGs","types of vesicles","secretory pathways","immature secretory granules","types of vesicle carriers","TGN","vesicular carriers","maturing vesicle","chapter","Dense core granules","mechanism of ISG formation","assembly of vesicle coats","vesicular organelles","important interactions","nature of interactions","ISG transformation","lumenal contents","Recent work","cell surface","condensing core","budding mechanism","mature fusion-competent","specific extracellular stimulus","current view of granule synthesis","physical separation","outbound traffic","endoproteolytic processing","continued condensation","function","concentrated cores\u2019 of condensed cargo","ISGs","membranes","rise","trans-Golgi network","systems","purified cellular components","lysosomes","aggregates","complete understanding","required cytosolic factors","order","unique features","endosomes","questions","time"],"language":"en"},

During the 1970s, several viruses were associated with this syndrome, which are now known to be caused mainly by viruses belonging to four distinct families\u2014rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Other viruses, such as the toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, coronavirus, and enterovirus 22, may play a role as well. Transmission by food or water has been documented for astroviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, and norovirus. In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children \u003C5 years, while deaths from diarrhea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness is based on demonstration of virus particles or antigen in stool, detection of viral nucleic acid in stool, or demonstration of a rise in specific antibody to the virus. Newer methods for syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis are being developed like multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs. Application of these more sensitive methods to detect and characterize individual agents is just beginning, but has already opened up new avenues to reassess their disease burden, examine their molecular epidemiology, and consider new directions for their prevention and control through vaccination, improvements in water quality, and sanitary practices.","publish_time":"2013-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Parul; Jain, Amita","journal":"Water and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4c461341f7f90ea738f70900a8828bf7db4fb51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122607/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute gastroenteritis","stool","syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis","children","caliciviruses","rotaviruses","astroviruses","common cause of death","demonstration of virus particles","common illnesses of human beings","water quality","new directions","Newer methods","sensitive methods","new avenues","associated morbidity","detection of viral nucleic acid","Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness","improvements","control","antigen","disease burden","molecular epidemiology","prevention","vaccination","rise","distinct families","years","specific antibody","hospitalization","deaths","diarrhea","extremes of age","sanitary practices","developing countries","real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs","enterovirus","picobirnaviruses","coronavirus","mortality","doctor visits","toroviruses","individual agents","Transmission","food","Application","norovirus","adenoviruses","role"],"language":"en"},

The high economic value of these plants is due to their secondary metabolites, especially essential oil of foliage, which is a complex mixture of volatile phytochemicals, such as terpenes, esters, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and phenols. The main phytoconstituents of the essential oil belong to the terpenoid group of metabolites, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their esters. Of these, geraniol, linalool, citronellol and their esters (50\u201370%) generally constitute a major portion of essential oil, responsible for its fragrance. Essential oil is biosynthesized in specialized tissues known as glandular trichomes present in leaves, green branches and fresh flowers. Geraniaceae family plants have been highly useful in the perfumery, cosmetics, aromatherapy, pharmaceuticals and food industries. Several pharmacological properties such as antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-depressant, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiseptic, anti-dysentery, and antidiabetic properties are attributed to the presence of geranium oil. Further, it improves blood circulation, treats congestion, cleans the lymphatic system, strengthens the immune system, and is effective in combating nervousness, constipation, insomnia, anxiety and high blood pressure.

Accordingly, patients with heart failure prefer to sit upright (e.g. supporting their back with pillows to achieve a maximum upright position) (Fig. 5.1). Conversely, placing the patient into a supine position may be used as a stress test to exclude respiratory distress due to heart failure or (pulmonary) fluid overload.

For frontline and other acute care facilities to be prepared, safety practices need to be assessed and reviewed as necessary as pertaining to all laboratory activities, to include the pre-analytical (specimen collection and processing), analytical (specimen testing), and post-analytical (specimen disposal/waste management and reporting) processes. Laboratorians and administrative personnel need to consider the risks in handling specimens containing these pathogens and subsequently develop or revise processes to mitigate risks. In addition, issues such as scalability to handle large volume testing, the availability of trained staff, and long-term sustainability to meet the requirements of regulatory agencies need to be adopted within a fiscally responsible budget setting.

The first class of this category refers to DAMPs, which are passively released from necrotic cells, and includes the most prominent subclasses of high mobility group box I and heat shock proteins. Further subclasses of DAMPs that are passively released from necrotic cells include S100 proteins, nucleic acids, histones, pro-forms of interleukin-1-family members, mitochondria-derived N-formylated peptides, F-actin, and heme. A particular subclass of these passively released DAMPs are molecules, which indirectly activate the inflammasome, including adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate, monosodium urate crystals, cholesterol crystals, some lipolytic species, and beta-amyloid. All these passively released DAMPs are characterized by their capability to promote necroinflammatory responses. The second class of this Category I refers to molecules, which are exposed on the surface of stressed cells. They include the subclass of phagocytosis-facilitating molecules such as calreticulin, as well as the subclass of MHC-I-related molecules such as MHC-I-related molecule A and B.

Generally, interest has been in the ability of vaccination to prevent or to ameliorate disease rather than to prevent infection (Clements-Mann 1998). Ascertainment of cases is often done by finding suspected cases in the population under study in people who exhibit a set of symptoms. The suspected cases are then tested for biological confirmation of the infectious agent of interest. Alternatively, surveillance can ascertain cases reported in central registries. However they are ascertained, with most vaccines, clinical disease is the primary outcome of interest. When ascertainment is on clinical cases, most asymptomatic infections may go undetected. A different situation arises when infection is the primary outcome. To ascertain infections in asymptomatic people, an active follow-up method of testing asymptomatic people is needed. In this chapter we consider estimation and inference for direct protective effects of vaccination, VE(S) and VE(SP), in studies that do not condition on exposure to infection.We consider aspects of the design of such studies. Several examples of randomized, double-blind (double-masked) controlled vaccine trials illustrate the standard approach to design and analysis of such studies. Our choice of studies to present was motivated largely because of their use as illustrations in other sections of the book. Most randomized and pivotal studies of vaccines have been based on VE(SP) or VE(S). Much has been written on studies to meet the approval of the regulatory agencies, and the design of clinical trials generally. Our goal here is to consider how VE(S) and VE(SP) relate to other measures of vaccine effects within the dependent happening context, and consider a few design considerations. Because VE(S) and VE(SP) do not condition on exposure to infection, assumptions about the relative exposure opportunity in the vaccine and control groups are important.","publish_time":"2009-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halloran, M.

By obtaining a focused clinical history from the patient, they can identify patients who need to be referred to their physician or to the emergency room, as well as which patients can be managed at home. Red flags that prompt referral include severe systemic illness, respiratory distress, hemoptysis, and altered level of consciousness. Patients with underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure who present with cough should be assessed for possible exacerbation of their illness and should be referred if this is suspected. Determining the duration of cough is an important step, as this helps identify possible etiologies. Cough \u003C3-week duration is categorized as acute, 3- to 8-week duration is subacute, and \u003E 8-week duration is a chronic cough. Patients with cough lasting \u003E3 weeks should generally be referred for further evaluation and management. Acute cough is often infectious but can also be due to exacerbation of underlying illness or could be medication-related. Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) is one of the most common causes of subacute and chronic cough. Several different etiologies lead to UACS, which is thought to be caused by postnasal drip \u00B1 sensitization of cough receptors in the respiratory tract. First-generation antihistamines or decongestants are therapeutic options when UACS is suspected. It is important to note that antitussive medications such as dextromethorphan can actually prolong illness in patients with a productive cough and are thus not recommended. Monitoring parameters and frequency of follow-up depend on underlying cause, severity of illnesses, past medical history, as well as medication changes.","publish_time":"2018-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glashan, Elizabeth; Mahmoud, Sherif Hanafy","journal":"Patient Assessment in Clinical Pharmacy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c5c1e77b3d878bb40eb423f54bb9a6beceae7da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic cough","duration of cough","Acute cough","productive cough","sensitization of cough receptors","management of patients","Upper airway cough syndrome","week duration","underlying chronic illnesses","exacerbation of underlying illness","UACS","severe systemic illness","underlying cause","important role","important step","possible exacerbation","possible etiologies","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","severity of illnesses","respiratory distress","respiratory tract","medication changes","medication-related","different etiologies","past medical history","focused clinical history","common causes of subacute","hemoptysis","prompt referral","asthma","frequency of follow-up","decongestants","therapeutic options","assessment","Red flags","heart failure","First-generation antihistamines","altered level of consciousness","postnasal drip","dextromethorphan","Monitoring parameters","antitussive medications","emergency room","physician","Pharmacists","weeks","evaluation","home"],"language":"en"},

In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the culture media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs (conditional media) contained various soluble chondrogenic factors and were effective for directing chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the conditional media can induce ASCs towards chondrogenic differentiation, especially for three-dimensional (3D) cartilage formation in a preshaped scaffold. In this study, it demonstrated that the conditional media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs could promote ASCs to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells, with similar expression of type II collagen to those induced by chondrogenic growth factors. Moreover, the expression level of chondrocyte-specific genes, such as SOX9, type II collagen, and COMP, was even higher in conditional medium group (CM) than that in optimized chondrogenic growth factor group (GF), indicating that the conditional media can serve as an effective inducer for chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs. Most importantly, the conditional media could also induce ASC-scaffold constructs to form 3D cartilage-like tissue with typical lacunae structures and positive expression of cartilage specific matrices, even higher contents of GAG and type II collagen were achieved in CM group compared to GF group. The current study establishes a simple, but stable, efficient, and economical method for directing 3D cartilage formation of ASCs, a strategy that may be more closely applicable for repairing cartilage defects.","publish_time":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Hengyun; Liu, Yu; Jiang, Ting; Liu, Xia; He, Aijuan; Li, Jie; Zhang, Wenjie; Liu, Wei; Cao, Yilin; Zhou, Guangdong","journal":"Tissue Eng Regen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3ee9d7c44f92f24d63bdf4c3fe6f046190cae78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASCs","GAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conditional media","chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs","D cartilage formation of ASCs","chondrocyte-scaffold constructs","conditional medium group","culture media","chondrogenic growth factors","cartilage defects","collagen","GF group","optimized chondrogenic growth factor group","chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells","expression level of chondrocyte","ASC-scaffold constructs","various soluble chondrogenic factors","preshaped scaffold","positive expression of cartilage specific matrices","similar expression of type","chondrogenesis of adiposederived stem cells","specific genes","effective inducer","current study","higher contents of GAG","typical lacunae structures","tissue","economical method","SOX9","strategy","COMP","lack of optimal inductive protocols","previous studies","great challenge"],"language":"en"},

These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the \u201Cone country, two systems\u201D model. As Beijing cannot send the People\u0027s Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong\u0027s once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland\u0027s public security. And as Hong Kong\u0027s judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city\u0027s freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors.

However, the association of congenital ZIKV infection with microcephaly and serious brain defects was not recognized until a large ZIKV outbreak began in Brazil in 2015. A similar association was retrospectively identified in a 2013\u20132014 French Polynesian outbreak. In this report, we describe two children, ages 6 (Case 1) and 7 years (Case 2), who display a phenotype consistent with CZS. In both cases, the mothers were residing in Cambodia during their pregnancies (2011 and 2010, respectively); Cambodia has reported ZIKV infections since 2007. METHODS: We review epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data, and the neurodevelopmental status of these two children. RESULTS: Both mothers reported low-grade fever and erythematous rash during their early second trimesters. The infants were born with severe microcephaly (\u003E3 SD below the mean) with central hypotonia and peripheral spasticity (Figure 1). Both had normal karyotypes, negative TORCH results, and neuroimaging suggestive of CZS with subcortical calcifications, polymicrogyria, abnormal corpus callosum, ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly, and reduced white matter (Figure 2). Case 1 had overlapping cranial sutures and redundant scalp (Figure 3). In 2016, serology immunofluorescence assay, immunoglobulin G, and plaque reduction neutralization test for the mother of Case 1 was positive for Zika. Serology for the mother of Case 2 is pending. Presently, both children have severe developmental delays; neither can sit or hold up their head, and both are nonverbal. Case 1 has bilateral hip contractures and hearing loss. Both are visually impaired and require gastrostomy-tube feedings. Case 2 is tracheostomy dependent. CONCLUSION: Given the maternal febrile rash illness, residence in a ZIKV region during pregnancy, infant features consistent with CZS, and the lack of other identified etiology, CZS should be considered as a possible diagnosis in these cases. It suggests that CZS may have occurred prior to the Brazil and French Polynesia outbreaks. Investigations into neurodevelopmental status of older children with possible CZS can provide insights into the possible long-term effects of CZS.

Boston Children\u2019s Hospital cared for 2796 international patients in 2016 but lacked an infection risk screening process for these patients, placing patients and staff at risk. We developed the Assessing Infection Risks for Safe Healthcare of International Patients (AIRSHIP) protocol to identify risks to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of IPC, infectious diseases, and International Health Services (IHS) experts assessed current IHS intake procedures and stakeholder engagement. We then developed AIRSHIP, devising standardized processes and forms to (1) assess underimmunization, MDRO and tuberculosis history, recent exposures, and current symptoms and (2) triage cases for catch-up immunization, urgent healthcare evaluation, and/or IPC intervention (Figure 1). We piloted incorporation of AIRSHIP into existing intake procedures. We tracked process, outcome, and balancing measures to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability to families (Figure 2) and made iterative improvements through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. RESULTS: For our first 13 cases, we completed pre-arrival family and referring provider interviews in 5 cases and on-arrival family interviews in 8 cases (in no cases were both pre-arrival and on-arrival interviews feasible). We were able to assign a risk category in all cases, identifying 5 patients with infection risks (38%) and 4 who were undervaccinated (30%). In 7 of 8 cases (88%) in which on-arrival interviews were performed, the interview and referring provider records yielded complete and reliable data. The average duration of family interviews was 18 minutes. All 13 families reported being \u201Cvery satisfied\u201D with AIRSHIP. CONCLUSION: International patients often present with active infections and are commonly undervaccinated. A feasible and effective strategy for infection risk screening of international patients is review of records pre-arrival, together with on-arrival family interview to gather additional data and identify acute symptoms and exposures.

Clinical teachers are central to the training of healthcare workers (HCW) as they teach and model safe practices in the clinical environment. However, there is limited research on the knowledge and practices of clinical teachers related to HH in teaching hospitals, particularly in African settings. We describe the knowledge and practices of HH amongst clinical teachers in selected teaching hospitals in Kenya. METHODS: Data were collected through self-administered standardized questionnaires with basic demographic, knowledge and practices about HH from clinical teachers employed at two teaching hospitals. Participating clinical teachers were anonymously audited for HH practices using an adapted World Health Organization tool. The audits consisted of 20\u201330 minutes observations in each ward RESULTS: Among 57 participants overall, 42 (73.7%) were nurses, 8 (14.0%) clinicians, and 5 (8.8%) therapists. Twenty-one (36.8%) of the participants had knowledge regarding the minimum time needed to practice HH using alcohol based hand rub, 14 (24.6%) knew that hand washing and hand rubbing should be performed in sequence. The combined knowledge score for each individual ranged from 0% to 94.1% with a mean of 50.1% (SD=20.1, Cl 95% 44.7- 55.4%). Hand hygiene compliance significantly varied by clinical instructor\u2019s type; nurses (42.7%) and therapists (38.0%) had the highest adherence and clinicians had the lowest 33.7% (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Clinical teachers in this study demonstrated knowledge gaps and poor practices related to HH. Since they serve as role models for future generations of healthcare workers, clinical teachers must recognize the importance of HH in preventing hospital-acquired infections, including when and how HH should be performed while following recommended practices.

To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (ST(a)), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces ST(a) were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P\u003C0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between ST(a) production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2002-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saeed, A.Mahdi; Bowersock, T.; Runnels, L.; Teclaw, R.F.","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Escherichia"],"organizations":["ST"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["dairy calves","groups of calves","fatal syndrome of veal calves","Veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis","pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates","veal calf industry","emergence of K99","K99 fimbrial antigens","known enteric pathogens","wide use of K99","K99 pili expression","enteric infection","prevalence of pathogenic","Various patterns of attachment","aggregative patterns of attachment","tissue culture cells","negative ETEC","heat-labile enterotoxin","heat-stable enterotoxin","possible role of common enteric pathogens","production of verotoxins","prevalence of similar","enterohemolysin","condition","hemagglutination activity","enterotoxigenic","disease","cases","significant association","result","multiple virulence attributes","identified specific etiology","midwestern United States","major concern","based vaccines","pathogenicity","control","colibacillosis","properties of","season","correlation","year"],"language":"en"},

Viral gastroenteritis can also inflict considerable nutritional insult on children because of anorexia, vomiting, malabsorption, and traditional therapies in which nutritionally poor diets are offered. This chapter discusses the treatment of the deficiencies of fluids, electrolytes, and nutrients. While there are already very good cost-effective strategies for correcting the sequelae of viral gastroenteritis, there is little yet available to effectively treat the acute symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea.

As such, the South African government has shown its commitment towards citizenry and the provision of effective service delivery. Social Media Analytics (SMA) has emerged as a potential new solution to support decision-making for service delivery in CzRM. It is believed that the demand for SMA adoption will increasingly rise. However, the reality of social media Big Data comes with the challenges of analysing it in a way that brings Big Value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the challenges of social media Big Data Analytics (BDA) and to incorporate these in a conceptual model that can be used by governments to support the e-participation of citizens. The model was developed through a systematic literature review (SLR). The findings revealed that data challenges relate to designing an optimal architecture for analysing data that caters for both historic data and real-time data at the same time. The paper highlight that process challenges relate to all the activities in the data lifecycle such as data acquisition and warehousing; data mining and cleaning; data aggregation and integration; analysis and modelling; and data interpretation. The paper also identifies six types of data management challenges: privacy, security, data governance, data and information sharing, cost/operational expenditures, and data ownership.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yakobi, Khulekani; Scholtz, Brenda; vom Berg, Benjamin","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40192f57fbab346b85487321c2110628879f5b77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Citizen Relationship Management","Social Media Analytics","Big Data","Big Data Analytics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data challenges","analysing data","data aggregation","data mining","data governance","data acquisition","data lifecycle","historic data","real-time data","data interpretation","data ownership","types of data management challenges","challenges of social media Big Data Analytics","reality of social media Big Data","process challenges","paper","Social Media Analytics","CzRM","e-participation","Big Value","emergence of Citizen Relationship Management","support decision-making","provision of effective service delivery","SMA adoption","conceptual model","developing citizen relationships","South African government","information sharing","privacy","security","operational expenditures","central role","analysis","cost","cleaning","warehousing","potential new solution","commitment","citizenry","modelling","integration","BDA","optimal architecture","activities","systematic literature review","SLR","governments","way","demand","citizens","findings","purpose"],"language":"en"},

As training groups are diverse, e.g., including both populations in developing and developed countries, and varying in age aspects, gender, languages, literacy levels and technological literacy levels, materials and the speed which training takes place has to be adapted to take into account these differences. The methodology involves use of training videos, and use a dual screen approach where training material is shown on one screen and training takes place on a second screen (computer). The approach has been evaluated in both developing countries and developed countries, with training groups of different capabilities and backgrounds (in Kenya, El Salvador, Spain, France and The Netherlands), with promising results.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hern\u00E1ndez, Susana Mu\u00F1oz; Earle, Clara Benac; Fredlund, Lars-\u00C5ke","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/345c2e503d709b55439b23e1980cf65385f027cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya","El Salvador","Spain","France"],"keyphrases":["training videos","digital literacy training","self-learning training material","training groups of different capabilities","developed countries","developing countries","technological literacy levels","dual screen approach","place","methodology","digital operational skills","languages","sense","backgrounds","targeted population","technical competence","Kenya","gender","age aspects","materials","Netherlands","Spain","Salvador","need","speed","key component","France","evaluation","populations","trained group","promising results","teacher","computer","adaptation","account","differences","article"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to identify most significant and non-significant predictors of consumer mobile shopping acceptance. Systematic review and weight analysis on 34 mobile shopping studies revealed researchers mostly employed TAM and UTAUT model as theoretical lens. This study found an interesting revelation that extrinsic motivation variables such as social influence and perceived usefulness determine consumer mobile shopping behavioral intention during early stages. However, in later stages intrinsic motivation variables such as satisfaction and trust play crucial role to emerge as best and promising predictor of consumer continuous intention respectively.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamilmani, Kuttimani; Rana, Nripendra P.; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Kizgin, Hatice","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef45dd423c3a3d1d7d5f54fdad1f5afb54f293e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134319.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mobile shopping adoption","mobile shopping studies","consumer mobile shopping behavioral intention","Mobile phones","non-significant predictors of consumer mobile shopping acceptance","various predictors of consumer adoption","study","promising predictor of consumer continuous intention","extrinsic motivation variables","later stages intrinsic motivation variables","early stages","perceived usefulness","social influence","TAM","satisfaction","weight analysis","researchers","UTAUT model","trust","interesting revelation","crucial role","product","majority of people","human lives","theoretical lens","globe","Systematic review","services","day-to-day needs","addition","objective"],"language":"en"},

Les infections virales figurent parmi les causes les plus fr\u00E9quentes des exacerbations mais les donn\u00E9es \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques sont, dans leur grande majorit\u00E9, issues de cohorte de pays temp\u00E9r\u00E9s.

R\u00C9SULTATS: Au total, 100 patients ont \u00E9t\u00E9 inclus dont 62 \u00E0 Saint Pierre et 38 \u00E0 Tours. La pr\u00E9sence d\u2019au moins un virus est retrouv\u00E9 dans les aspirations naso-pharyng\u00E9es chez 53 % des patients \u00E0 Tours et 31 % des patients \u00E0 Saint Pierre (p \u003C 0,05). La r\u00E9partition des virus diff\u00E8re selon la g\u00E9olocalisation. Le rhinovirus est l\u2019esp\u00E8ce la plus fr\u00E9quemment retrouv\u00E9e dans les 2 groupes : soit 42 % des pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements \u00E0 Saint Pierre et 30 % \u00E0 Tours. On trouve de fa\u00E7on \u00E9quivalente, entre les groupes, le virus influenza A dans 19 % des cas. Le classement diverge ensuite, l\u2019ent\u00E9rovirus qui repr\u00E9sente 19 % des aspirations naso-pharyng\u00E9es \u00E0 Tours n\u2019est pas retrouv\u00E9 \u00E0 Saint Pierre. Inversement, le virus influenza H1N1 et le virus para-influenza identifi\u00E9s dans 12 et 4 % des pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements \u00E0 Saint Pierre sont absents \u00E0 Tours. Les exacerbations semblent avoir une saisonnalit\u00E9 \u00E0 Tours avec un pic en septembre et en hiver. Aucune saisonnalit\u00E9 n\u2019est retrouv\u00E9e sous le climat tropical de la R\u00E9union. CONCLUSION: La proportion de patients hospitalis\u00E9s pour exacerbation d\u2019asthme et ayant un pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement viral positif est plus faible en climat tropical qu\u2019en climat temp\u00E9r\u00E9.

Cell lysis occurred 24 h post-infection and was shown by a decreased neutral red uptake. UV inactivation of the influenza virus, or the addition of anti-influenza antibodies suppressed the virus-induced macrophage lysis. Inversely, pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages by a phagocytosis inhibitor, namely cytochalasin B, increased the cell susceptibility to virus-induced lysis. The present in vitro studies support the hypothesis that defects in pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms associated with influenza infections are partly due to a direct toxic effect of the virus on alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, the studies show that virus-induced macrophage lysis is influenced by specific humoral immune responses and by modifications in microfilament cell functions.","publish_time":"2006-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charley, B.","journal":"Ann Inst Pasteur Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02272eaecb2fa1b98f52b0a5f7d3883889e11d94.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine influenza virus","virus-induced lysis","virus-induced macrophage lysis","Cell lysis","influenza infections","pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages","cell susceptibility","studies","addition of anti-influenza antibodies","microfilament cell functions","modifications","specific humoral immune responses","phagocytosis inhibitor","hypothesis","cytochalasin B","pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms","h post-infection","direct toxic effect","Interactions","decreased neutral red uptake","UV inactivation"],"language":"en"},

The consequential decrease in lung function ranges in severity from subclinical to life-threatening or even fatal and can manifest in the acute setting or many years after completion of therapy. Radiation effects are due to direct insult to the pulmonary parenchyma and, for younger children, impaired thoracic musculoskeletal development. Radiation pneumonitis can occur in the acute/subacute setting, as well as fibrosis with comprised gas exchange as a late effect of direct lung irradiation; thoracic wall malformation can cause restriction of function as a chronic sequela. The pulmonary effects of cytotoxic drugs usually present as acute effects, but there is the potential for significant late morbidity and mortality. Of course, surgical interventions can also cause both acute and/or late pulmonary effects as well, depending on the specific procedure. Although treatment approaches for the management of pediatric cancers are continually adapted to provide optimal therapy while minimizing toxicities, to a varying degree all therapies have the potential for both acute and late pulmonary toxicity. Of note, the cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications rises with increasing time since diagnosis, which suggests that adult survivors of childhood cancer require lifelong monitoring and management of potential new-onset pulmonary morbidity as they age. Knowledge of cytotoxic therapies and an understanding of lung physiology and how it may be altered by therapy facilitate appropriate clinical care and monitoring of long-term survivors.","publish_time":"2015-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhakal, Sughosh; Weiner, Daniel; Schwartz, Cindy; Constine, Louis S.","journal":"Survivors of Childhood and Adolescent Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c8bece8c51b00f2bbf004a497b5e2bb7e1c7743.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["late pulmonary effects","acute effects","late pulmonary toxicity","pulmonary parenchyma","pulmonary effects of cytotoxic drugs","cancer therapy","Radiation effects","management of potential new-onset pulmonary morbidity","cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications","completion of therapy","optimal therapy","significant late morbidity","late effect of direct lung irradiation","lung function ranges","monitoring of long-term survivors","understanding of lung physiology","Knowledge of cytotoxic therapies","lifelong monitoring","direct insult","restriction of function","adult survivors of childhood cancer","subacute setting","Radiation pneumonitis","thoracic wall malformation","management of pediatric cancers","impaired thoracic musculoskeletal development","younger children","severity","appropriate clinical care","comprised gas exchange","fibrosis","diagnosis","increasing time","consequential decrease","toxicities","varying degree","mortality","years","treatment approaches","chronic sequela","note","surgical interventions","therapeutic modalities","specific procedure"],"language":"en"},

Contemporary globally connected civilization is more at risk from various modern infectious diseases than classical ones such as pests, cholera, and tuberculosis. Over the last few years, pandemic outbreaks of highly virulent influenza, possibly related to avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and middle-eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MARSE) have been a threat. Beyond this, the intentional spread of infectious disease, e.g., \u201Cbioterrorism\u201D, has come to be recognized as being just as dangerous as nuclear weapons. An infectious disease spreads on human social networks. Each individual can protect himself through several measures. Pre-emptive vaccination is thought to be most effective, although it incurs a partial cost to each individual. This brings about a social dilemma, because an individual may be able to rely on so-called \u201Cherd immunity\u201D to avoid his own infection without himself being vaccinated. Also, besides vaccination, there may be several practical ways to protect against contagion, such as wearing a mask, keeping away from crowds, and self-isolation by leaving the home less often, which may be less costly and less effective than vaccination. In any case, there is a human-decision-making process regarding what steps should be taken, while the dynamics of infectious-disease spread can themselves be evaluated as a diffusion problem that has been well-studied in physics for many years. Thus, based on the concept of human\u2013environment\u2013social interaction, a basic-physics model for this diffusion problem that considers evolutionary game theory (EGT) may lead us to obtain some meaningful solutions that can be proposed to our society. Following the previous chapter explaining how EGT can be applied to traffic-flow analysis, this chapter describes this practical problem.","publish_time":"2018-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanimoto, Jun","journal":"Evolutionary Games with Sociophysics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8823215ec3877238bd206bebabaaf79fe6cea6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease spreads","intentional spread of infectious disease","dynamics of infectious","individual","diffusion problem","practical problem","human social networks","various modern infectious diseases","social interaction","human-decision","concept of human","social dilemma","EGT","years","Pre-emptive vaccination","society","severe acute respiratory syndrome","previous chapter","practical ways","middle-eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus","basic-physics model","classical ones","avian flu","SARS","risk","pests","virulent influenza","MARSE","environment","evolutionary game theory","pressing issue","cholera","pandemic outbreaks","traffic-flow analysis","connected civilization","self-isolation","crowds","herd immunity","contagion","process","partial cost","nuclear weapons","home","mask","steps","tuberculosis","bioterrorism","meaningful solutions","infection","threat","measures","case"],"language":"en"},

Adopting this dual approach offers both a contrastive and a complementary way of rethinking the underlying socioethical tensions elicited by pandemic influenza in particular and other public health disasters generally.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Afolabi, Michael Olusegun","journal":"Public Health Disasters: A Global Ethical Framework","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb280d24e139440839ad128c66e1c00191cf0722.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124108.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["communitarian-oriented ethical lens","pandemic influenza","individual-oriented","people-oriented approach","types of public health disasters","vis-\u00E0","analytical lens of ethical prisms","moral quandaries","dual approach","underlying socioethical tensions","underlying relational nexus","useful perspectives","care ethics framework","traditional bioethical lenses","capacities","complementary way","families","schools","chapter","spread of infection","Community-networks"],"language":"en"},

Production processes involve a narrowing diversity of bioreactors for cell, hairy root, microalgae, and moss cultivation. For whole plants, both field and automated greenhouse cultivation methods are used with products expressed and produced either in leaves or seeds. Many successful expression systems now exist for a variety of different products with a list of increasingly successful commercialized products.

A viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI) in the absence of overt illness (subclinical vURTI) will not be made manifest to the individual or to observers and, therefore, will not be diagnosed as a CLI. The degree of illness occurring during a vURTI is directly related to the extent of provoked inflammation, which in turn depends on the engagement of antiviral defense systems. Thus, risk factors for CLI can modulate either the vURTI risk by affecting virus exposure and/or susceptibility to infection, or the CLI risk given a vURTI by affecting immunocompetence, the provoked inflammation and/or the interpretation of ilness as a CLI. In this chapter, we review published studies for evidence of CLI risk-modulating factors and report that climate, crowding and perhaps female gender can affect the probability of exposure to vURTI viruses, that extant immunological factors and age can affect the probability of virus infection given exposure, that stress levels (moderated by social environment), health practices (exercise, tobacco and alcohol consumption, sleep efficiency) and genetics contribute to CLI risk most probably by modulating the immune-inflammatory response to infection, and that other factors such as pollution, home environment and certain personality traits affect CLI risk by biasing illness interpretation for a given set of symptoms and signs.","publish_time":"2009-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doyle, William J.; Cohen, Sheldon","journal":"Common Cold","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ca87acde2d673e129b4360d84dce19f2555438b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vURTI risk","risk factors","virus exposure","probability of virus infection","evidence of CLI risk-modulating factors","upper respiratory virus","parainfuluenza virus","influenza virus","vURTI viruses","subclinical vURTI","respiratory syncytial virus","probability of exposure","degree of illness","viral upper respiratory tract infection","biasing illness interpretation","extant immunological factors","absence of overt illness","given set of symptoms","extent of provoked inflammation","development of sufficient signs","home environment","social environment","interpretation of ilness","certain personality traits","tobacco","rhinovirus","alcohol consumption","exercise","health practices","sleep efficiency","stress levels","climate","pollution","coronavirus","published studies","genetics","report","turn","immunocompetence","susceptibility","engagement of antiviral defense systems","female gender","immune-inflammatory response","pathophysiologies","manifest","adenovirus","cultural definitions","individual","observers","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Early as well as current efforts have focused mainly on East Asian and North American Caucasian cultures, with little treatment of other populations. In such studies, individualism and collectivism have been the dominant explanatory factors although related but distinct concepts such as \u201Ctightness\u201D and \u201Clooseness\u201D have been welcome additions to recent discussions.

Some viruses that produce colds are capable of infecting an individual repeatedly (eg, respiratory syncytial virus); others, with many serotypes (eg, rhinovirus), infect only once. The sustained epidemic of colds that occurs annually during September through April is explained by successive waves of different viruses moving through a community. The peak incidence of colds occurs in preschool children, who typically sustain at least one illness per month during the epidemic period. Clinical manifestations of colds are largely subjective in adults. Colds in preschoolers differ from those in adults as follows: (1) fever is common in children during the first 3 days; (2) colored nasal secretions may be the only indication of nasal involvement in children; and (3) colds in children last 10 to 14 days, as compared with a duration of less than a week in adults. The paranasal sinuses and the middle ear cavities are commonly involved during viral colds in adults (and presumably in children) in the absence of bacterial superinfection. Cold symptoms are due to the host\u0027s response to the virus rather than to destruction of the nasal mucosa. Viral infection of a very limited portion of the nasal epithelium results in an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, cytokine release, and a vascular leak. Colds are self-limited illnesses. Therefore, in the absence of adequate blinding of controls, ineffective treatments erroneously may be considered efficacious.

This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzT\u03A6. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzT\u03A6 into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective. The PK/T7 cell line can be used to rescue CSFV directly from cloned cDNA and it can also be used as an intracellular transcription and expression system for studying the structure and function of viral genes.","publish_time":"2013-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"HUANG, Jun-hua; LI, Yong-feng; HE, Fan; LI, Dan; SUN, Yuan; HAN, Wen; QIU, Hua-ji","journal":"J Integr Agric","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PK","T7 cells","T7 promoter","cloned cDNA","T7 cell line","progeny virus","parent virus","T7 terminator sequences","classical reverse genetics","bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase","viral genomic cDNA clone","intracellular transcription","transcription-based rescue system","rapid recovery of CSFV","CSFV Shimen strain","Full-length genomic cDNA","classical swine fever virus","hepatitis delta virus ribozyme","pOKShimen-RzT\u03A6","derived cell line","function of viral genes","Direct transfection of pOKShimen","greater viral titer","transcribed RNA","expression system","structure","improved method","vector pOK12","study"],"language":"en"},

Web-based and mobile phone-based self-management applications have been proven to be effective in improving self-management behaviour of patients with MetS components (i.e., diabetes or hypertension). However, evidence is lacking in terms of their effectiveness specifically for patients with MetS. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention in improving activation and self-management behaviours among patients with MetS. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a university primary care clinic. A total of 232 patients aged 18\u201360 years with MetS will be recruited; 116 will be randomised to receive the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention for 6 months, and another 116 patients will continue with usual care. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention is a multifaceted chronic disease management strategy based on the Chronic Care Model and persuasive technology theory. It consists of training primary care physicians, nurses and patients to use the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN web-based self-management mobile app, strengthening the patient\u2013physician relationship and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines to guide management and prescribing. The primary outcome is the mean change in patient activation score using the Patient Activation Measure short form Malay version (PAM-13-M) questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include the changes in waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, patient physical activity level, eating behaviour, perception of chronic illness care, satisfaction with patient\u2013physician interaction, and perceived absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. Feasibility of implementing the intervention will be evaluated. This includes acceptability of the intervention, estimating the likely rate of participant recruitment and retention, appropriateness of the outcome measures, calculation of sample size, and the intervention\u2019s potential effectiveness. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Malaysia that aims to determine the feasibility of a multifaceted e-health intervention, as well as to indicate more useful aspects of this intervention for further exploration in a larger trial.

The samples examined for viral analysis consisted of concentrates prepared from raw sewage, chosen as providing a representation of the spectrum of viruses being intestinally shed from a large population at any given time. When using one single cell line, HEp-2, the overall numbers of adenoviruses detected using cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were roughly equal. In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence. The relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present in the sewage concentrates we examined was, on average, 94-fold greater than that of enteroviruses. Assay of enteroviruses was performed by plaque assay in the BGM cell line.","publish_time":"2003-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurst, Christon J.; McClellan, Kim A.; Benton, William H.","journal":"Water Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of adenoviruses","BGM cell line","single cell line","overall numbers of adenoviruses","cytopathogenicity","relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present","different samples","different methods","Assay of enteroviruses","immunofluorescence","concentrates","plaque assay","raw sewage","average virus titers","efficiency","times","large population","viral analysis","given time","representation","hands","spectrum of viruses","situ hybridization","nonparametric comparison"],"language":"en"},

As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25\u201336 months, 37\u201348 months, 49\u201360 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age \u00D7 sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age \u00D7 sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49\u201360 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracic radiographic parameters for the healthy cynomolgus monkey presented here should prove useful in veterinary practice, research involving non-human primate models of respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, and morphological studies on cynomolgus monkeys.","publish_time":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Liang; Zhou, Qinming; Liu, Shigang; Wu, Qingyuan; Ji, Yongjia; Zhang, Lujun; Xu, Fan; Gong, Wei; Melgiri, Narayan D.; Xie, Peng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0e5a700bc9e8fe25e5c3f2c10976314cb30c150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3885584.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3885584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age groups","effect of age","significant sex","TD","TBr","CBr","sex interactions","CR","months","Significant effects","thoracic radiography parameters","thoracic radiographic parameters","healthy cynomolgus monkeys","R-HHR","females","maximal interior thoracic breadth","non-human primate species","baseline thoracic radiography","maximal interior thoracic depth","non-human primate models of respiratory","LL","left costophrenic angles","biomedical research","angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles","cardiothoracic ratio","cardiac silhouette breadth","hilar height ratio","cardiovascular disorders","LCA","morphological studies","veterinary practice","age-related differences","RCA","lung length","Macaca fascicularis","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","hypothesis","RESULTS","sexes","chest film","METHODS","Statistical analysis"],"language":"en"},

Here, we establish that the antimycotic heptaen, amphotericin B (AmphoB), prevents IFITM3-mediated restriction of IAV, thereby increasing viral replication. Consistent with its neutralization of IFITM3, a clinical preparation of AmphoB, AmBisome, reduces the majority of interferon\u2019s protective effect against IAV in vitro. Mechanistic studies reveal that IFITM1 decreases host-membrane fluidity, suggesting both a possible mechanism for IFITM-mediated restriction and its negation by AmphoB. Notably, we reveal that mice treated with AmBisome succumbed to a normally mild IAV infection, similar to animals deficient in Ifitm3. Therefore, patients receiving antifungal therapy with clinical preparations of AmphoB may be functionally immunocompromised and thus more vulnerable to influenza, as well as other IFITM3-restricted viral infections.","publish_time":"2013-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Tsai-Yu; Chin, Christopher R.; Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; Perreira, Jill M.; Savidis, George; Aker, Aaron M.; John, Sinu P.; Sarlah, David; Carreira, Erick M.; Elledge, Stephen J.; Kellam, Paul; Brass, Abraham L.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74a50bcf30b8484ab04a58452bd9a5e04236f02a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/19d4a8102c9c60c132a3c64b4ae0beadd0895559.json; document_parses/pdf_json/daa7e124a09a2e115e1280e4c31891db5a22b05d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3898084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM3-mediated restriction of IAV","neutralization of IFITM3","clinical preparations of AmphoB","clinical preparation of AmphoB","mild IAV infection","AmBisome","IFITM3-restricted viral infections","influenza","viral replication","IFITM-mediated restriction","possible mechanism","animals deficient","IFITM1","antifungal therapy","host-membrane fluidity","majority of interferon\u2019s protective effect","amphotericin B","patients","antimycotic heptaen","virus","negation","Mechanistic studies","IFITMs","mice"],"language":"en"},

However, their mutation rates vary amply, from 10(\u22126) to 10(\u22124) substitutions per nucleotide per round of copying (s/n/r) and the causes of this variability remain poorly understood. In addition to differences in intrinsic fidelity or error correction capability, viral mutation rates may be dependent on host factors. Here, we assessed the effect of the cellular environment on the rate of spontaneous mutation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which has a broad host range and cell tropism. Luria-Delbr\u00FCck fluctuation tests and sequencing showed that VSV mutated similarly in baby hamster kidney, murine embryonic fibroblasts, colon cancer, and neuroblastoma cells (approx. 10(\u22125) s/n/r). Cell immortalization through p53 inactivation and oxygen levels (1\u201321%) did not have a significant impact on viral replication fidelity. This shows that previously published mutation rates can be considered reliable despite being based on a narrow and artificial set of laboratory conditions. Interestingly, we also found that VSV mutated approximately four times more slowly in various insect cells compared with mammalian cells. This may contribute to explaining the relatively slow evolution of VSV and other arthropod-borne viruses in nature.","publish_time":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Combe, Marine; Sanju\u00E1n, Rafael","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36f2b61e18bb25cb901f5fa53842b4dcc287dac1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3900646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral mutation rates","published mutation rates","higher rates of spontaneous mutation","rate of spontaneous mutation","DNA viruses","RNA viruses","neuroblastoma cells","mammalian cells","slow evolution of VSV","viral replication fidelity","various insect cells","intrinsic fidelity","Cell immortalization","cell tropism","host factors","broad host range","error correction capability","murine embryonic fibroblasts","colon cancer","baby hamster kidney","round of copying","vesicular stomatitis virus","p53 inactivation","differences","sequencing","arthropod","oxygen levels","Luria-Delbr\u00FCck fluctuation tests","cellular environment","reliable despite","artificial set of laboratory conditions","nucleotide","significant impact","times","microorganisms","substitutions","addition","causes","effect","nature","variability"],"language":"en"},

Since there is no causative treatment of SIV, we tested if probiotic Enterococcus (E.) faecium NCIMB 10415 or zinc (Zn) oxide as feed supplements provide beneficial effects upon SIV infection in piglets. Seventy-two weaned piglets were fed three different diets containing either E. faecium or different levels of Zn (2500 ppm, Zn(high); 50 ppm, Zn(low)). Half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (VAC) twice with an inactivated trivalent SIV vaccine, while all piglets were then infected intranasally with H3N2 SIV. Significantly higher weekly weight gains were observed in the E. faecium group before virus infection, and piglets in Zn(high) and E. faecium groups gained weight after infection while those in the control group (Zn(low)) lost weight. Using ELISA, we found significantly higher H3N2-specific antibody levels in the E. faecium\u002BVAC group 2 days before and at the day of challenge infection as well as at 4 and 6 days after challenge infection. Higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were also observed in the Zn(high)\u002BVAC and E. faecium\u002BVAC groups at 0, 1 and 4 days after infection. However, there were no significant differences in virus shedding and lung lesions between the dietary groups. Using flow cytometry analysis significantly higher activated T helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentages in the PBMCs were detected in the Zn(high) and E. faecium groups at single time points after infection compared to the Zn(low) control group, but no prolonged effect was found. In the BAL cells no influence of dietary supplementation on immune cell percentages could be detected. Our results suggest that feeding high doses of zinc oxide and particularly E. faecium could beneficially influence humoral immune responses after vaccination and recovery from SIV infection, but not affect virus shedding and lung pathology.","publish_time":"2014-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhenya; Burwinkel, Michael; Chai, Weidong; Lange, Elke; Blohm, Ulrike; Breithaupt, Angele; Hoffmann, Bernd; Twardziok, Sven; Rieger, Juliane; Janczyk, Pawel; Pieper, Robert; Osterrieder, Nikolaus","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df1017e24101a51f6b5ca30ae2cb8376d8756a61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3904981.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIV infection","faecium groups","virus infection","faecium NCIMB","different levels of Zn","H3N2 SIV","VAC groups","day of challenge infection","dietary groups","control group","weaned piglets","days","causative treatment of SIV","high doses of zinc oxide","inactivated trivalent SIV vaccine","higher weekly weight gains","higher activated T helper cells","Higher hemagglutination inhibition","higher H3N2-specific antibody levels","ppm","immune cell percentages","influence of dietary supplementation","cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentages","BAL cells","different diets","lung lesions","significant differences","significant disease","lung pathology","humoral immune responses","feed supplements","beneficial effects","flow cytometry analysis","vaccination","recovery","single time points","titers","PBMCs","probiotic Enterococcus","Swine influenza viruses","prolonged effect","pigs","results","ELISA","Half"],"language":"en"},

A retrospective review of MDRO records has been conducted throughout the period from January 2012 till December 2012. Organisms were identified and tested by an automated identification and susceptibility system, and the antibiotic susceptibility testing was confirmed by the disk diffusion method. Results. Out of the total of 29,245 admissions, there have been 315 patients registered as MDRO patients giving an overall prevalence rate of 10.8 (95% CI 9.3, 12.4) MDRO cases per 1000 admissions. In addition, the prevalence rate of MDRO isolates was 11.2 (95% CI 9.7, 12.9) per 1000 admissions. Overall, increasing trends in prevalence rates of MDRO patients and MDRO isolates were observed throughout the study period. Conclusion. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging challenge in Oman. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility and strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines are essential to prevent proliferation of MDRO. Along such quest, stringent antibiotic prescription guidelines are needed in the country.","publish_time":"2014-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balkhair, Abdullah; Al-Farsi, Yahya M.; Al-Muharrmi, Zakariya; Al-Rashdi, Raiya; Al-Jabri, Mansoor; Neilson, Fatma; Al-Adawi, Sara S.; El-Beeli, Marah; Al-Adawi, Samir","journal":"ScientificWorldJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ecf2ad1996b1e93edd3eb7a8b2207114a33818a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3914445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sultan Qaboos University Hospital","MDRO"],"locations":["Arabian Gulf","Oman"],"keyphrases":["proliferation of MDRO","MDRO cases","prevalence rates of MDRO patients","prevalence rate of MDRO isolates","admissions","retrospective review of MDRO records","Antimicrobial resistance","overall prevalence rate","tertiary hospital","susceptibility system","epidemiology of multidrug resistant organisms","antibiotic susceptibility testing","Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility","Oman","CI","epidemiology of multi-drug resistant organisms","stringent antibiotic prescription guidelines","emerging challenge","global challenge","study period","tertiary care settings","infection prevention guidelines","Sultan Qaboos University Hospital","strict adherence","Arabian Gulf","quest","trends","disk diffusion method","automated identification","addition","country","studies","total","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The absence of licensed therapeutics for clinical use has intensified research into anti-EV-71 development. This review highlights the potential antiviral agents targeting EV-71 attachment, entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, virus-induced formation of membranous RNA replication complexes, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strategies for antiviral development include target-based synthetic compounds, anti-rhinovirus and poliovirus libraries screening, and natural compound libraries screening. Growing knowledge of the EV-71 life cycle will lead to successful development of antivirals. The continued effort to develop antiviral agents for treatment is crucial in the absence of a vaccine.

METHODS: This analysis reports herein further studies based on time-course microarray analysis with focus on malaria-induced host immune response. RESULTS: The results show that in early malaria, selected immune response-related genes were up-regulated including \u03B1 \u03B2 and \u03B3 interferon-related genes, as well as genes of IL-15, CD36, chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, S100A8/9, CXCL9, and CXCL11), TRAIL and IgG Fc receptors. During acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes included \u03B1 \u03B2 and \u03B3 interferon-related genes, IL-8, IL-1b IL-10 downstream genes, TGFB1, oncostatin-M, chemokines, IgG Fc receptors, ADCC signalling, complement-related genes, granzymes, NK cell killer/inhibitory receptors and Fas antigen. During recovery, genes for NK receptorsand granzymes/perforin were up-regulated. When viewed in terms of immune response type, malaria infection appeared to induce a mixed TH1 response, in which \u03B1 and \u03B2 interferon-driven responses appear to predominate over the more classic IL-12 driven pathway. In addition, TH17 pathway also appears to play a significant role in the immune response to P. falciparum. Gene markers of TH17 (neutrophil-related genes, TGFB1 and IL-6 family (oncostatin-M)) and TH\u03B1\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B3 and NK cytotoxicity and ADCC gene) immune response were up-regulated. Initiation of TH\u03B1\u03B2 immune response was associated with an IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 response, which ultimately resulted in moderate-mild IFN-\u03B3 achieved via a pathway different from the more classic IL-12 TH1 pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these observations, this study speculates that in P. falciparum infection, TH\u03B1\u03B2/TH17 immune response may predominate over ideal TH1 response.","publish_time":"2013-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Wan-Chung","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a7b43dfdae9273f455a5ab85cc9f2535da359a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3928643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3928643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genes of IL","immune response-related genes","TH17 immune response","regulated genes","\u03B3 interferon-related genes","Initiation of TH\u03B1\u03B2 immune response","neutrophil-related genes","downstream genes","terms of immune response type","mixed TH1 response","ideal TH1 response","IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 response","malaria-induced host immune response","classic IL","b IL","malaria infection","\u03B1 \u03B2","falciparum infection","TH17 pathway","IgG Fc receptors","early malaria","inhibitory receptors","driven pathway","\u03B2 interferon-driven responses","moderate-mild IFN-\u03B3","NK cytotoxicity","NK receptorsand granzymes","chemokines","ADCC gene","acute febrile malaria","TGFB1","Gene markers of TH17","analysis reports","Plasmodium falciparum","oncostatin","pathway different","study","TH1 pattern","RESULTS","time-course microarray analysis","NK cell killer","ADCC signalling","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","focus","MHC molecules","p38-MAPK","CCL2","studies","TRAIL","CD36","Fas antigen","TNF","CXCL9","S100A8","CXCL10","CXCL11","recovery","perforin","NF-\u03BAB","significant role","regulation of toll","family","observations","METHODS","BACKGROUND","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis showed that the preferred synonymous codons were G/C and A-ended. A comparative analysis of RSCU between CHIKV and its hosts showed that codon usage patterns of CHIKV are a mixture of coincidence and antagonism. Similarity index analysis showed that the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV have been strongly influenced by Pan troglodytes and Aedes albopictus during evolution. The overall codon usage bias was low in CHIKV genomes, as inferred from the analysis of effective number of codons (ENC) and codon adaptation index (CAI). Our data suggested that although mutation pressure dominates codon usage in CHIKV, patterns of codon usage in CHIKV are also under the influence of natural selection from its hosts and geography.

The NGS would be sensitive and useful for analysis of less dependent on specific primers and screening of genotypes.","publish_time":"2013-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"MINAMI-FUKUDA, Fujiko; NAGAI, Makoto; TAKAI, Hikaru; MURAKAMI, Toshiaki; OZAWA, Tadashi; TSUCHIAKA, Shinobu; OKAZAKI, Sachiko; KATAYAMA, Yukie; OBA, Mami; NISHIURA, Naomi; SASSA, Yukiko; OMATSU, Tsutomu; FURUYA, Tetsuya; KOYAMA, Satoshi; SHIRAI, Junsuke; TSUNEMITSU, Hiroshi; FUJII, Yoshiki; KATAYAMA, Kazuhiko; MIZUTANI, Tetsuya","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71b5ffbc04fa339eed42ead8bb5dd1bf0e471b8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3942952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942952/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAD","NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR","NGS","Dipstick","RAD kits","equine rotavirus","highest sensitivity","higher sensitivity","RVA","sensitivity of human rotavirus rapid antigen detection","mapping reads","detection of bovine group","negative fecal samples","selected strains","limited dilution analyses","specific primers","analysis","generation DNA sequencing","reference sequences","genotyping","screening of genotypes","results","Eiken","genome segments"],"language":"en"},

The small size of FAST proteins is incompatible with the paradigmatic membrane fusion pathway proposed for enveloped viral fusion proteins. Understanding how these diminutive viral fusogens mediate the complex process of membrane fusion is therefore of considerable interest, from both the pathogenesis and mechanism-of-action perspectives. Using chimeric ARV/NBV p10 constructs, the 36\u201340-residue ectodomain was identified as the major determinant of the differing fusion efficiencies of these homologous p10 proteins. Extensive mutagenic analysis determined the ectodomain comprises two distinct, essential functional motifs. Syncytiogenesis assays, thiol-specific surface biotinylation, and liposome lipid mixing assays identified an \u223C25-residue, N-terminal motif that dictates formation of a cystine loop fusion peptide in both ARV and NBV p10. Surface immunofluorescence staining, FRET analysis and cholesterol depletion/repletion studies determined the cystine loop motif is connected through a two-residue linker to a 13-residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER). The MPER constitutes a second, independent motif governing reversible, cholesterol-dependent assembly of p10 multimers in the plasma membrane. Results further indicate that: (1) ARV and NBV homomultimers segregate to distinct, cholesterol-dependent microdomains in the plasma membrane; (2) p10 homomultimerization and cholesterol-dependent microdomain localization are co-dependent; and (3) the four juxtamembrane MPER residues present in the multimerization motif dictate species-specific microdomain association and homomultimerization. The p10 ectodomain therefore constitutes a remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion module that directs syncytiogenic efficiency and species-specific assembly of p10 homomultimers into cholesterol-dependent fusion platforms in the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Key, Tim; Duncan, Roy","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6aaa812b1328c197742f99a19de18480c709dbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3961370.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozgw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nelson Bay"],"organizations":["ARV/NBV","MPER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homologous p10 fusion","p10 ectodomain","plasma membrane","homologous p10 proteins","p10 homomultimerization","cholesterol-dependent fusion platforms","paradigmatic membrane fusion pathway","enveloped viral fusion proteins","complex process of membrane fusion","smallest known viral membrane fusion proteins","NBV p10 constructs","cholesterol-dependent assembly of p10 multimers","residue ectodomain","differing fusion efficiencies","multifunctional fusion module","cystine loop fusion peptide","species-specific assembly of p10 homomultimers","residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region","cholesterol-dependent microdomains","cholesterol depletion","cholesterol-dependent microdomain localization","cystine loop motif","multimerization motif","independent motif","small size of FAST proteins","chimeric ARV","residue linker","NBV homomultimers segregate","N-terminal motif","species-specific microdomain association","FRET analysis","Syncytiogenesis assays","fusogenic reoviruses","juxtamembrane MPER residues present","Surface immunofluorescence staining","Extensive mutagenic analysis","thiol-specific surface biotinylation","repletion studies","syncytiogenic efficiency","formation","major determinant","virulence determinants","liposome lipid","Nelson Bay","essential functional motifs","mechanism","pathogenesis","action perspectives","Results"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we explored inflammation-promoting activity of HMGB1 and blockade of extracellular release of HMGB1 by glycyrrhizin (GL) in LPS/GalN-triggered mouse liver injury. At 1 to 10 h after LPS/GalN-treatment, mice were anesthetized to collect blood from heart puncture, and serum transaminase and HMGB1 were evaluated. Administration of LPS/GalN precipitated tissue injury associated with time-dependent alteration in HMGB1 serum levels. At 8 h nuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced and extracellular HMGB1 expression was found exclusively in the pericentral foci. The treatment with GL significantly down-regulated the serum levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1 in addition to the strong inhibition of tissue injury and extracellular immunoreactivity to HMGB1 and to acetylated-lysine. Furthermore, GL brought about a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic hepatocytes labeled with TUNEL-method. On the basis of these results, three apoptosis-associated genes were identified with microarray analysis and real-time PCR. The ChIP-assay revealed the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-treated mice and the remarkable decrease in combined HMGB1 protein by GL. The current findings claim that a single injection of LPS/GalN might stimulate apoptosis of hepatocytes through the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter region and that GL-treatment might prevent the apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrates caused with LPS/GalN-injection by disturbing the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuroda, Noriyuki; Inoue, Kouji; Ikeda, Tadayuki; Hara, Yaiko; Wake, Kenjiro; Sato, Tetsuji","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1516a62bffb7478ad5cbec0bde15290baf5384a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3972228.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozkw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of HMGB1","binding of HMGB1 protein","combined HMGB1 protein","HMGB1 serum levels","extracellular HMGB1 expression","GalN-treatment","blockade of extracellular release of HMGB1","GalN-injection","Administration of LPS","GL-treatment","GalN precipitated tissue injury","GalN-treated mice","single injection of LPS","Gsto1 promoter sequence","apoptosis of hepatocytes","GalN-triggered mouse liver injury","Gsto1 promoter region","extracellular immunoreactivity","serum transaminase","serum levels of ALT","apoptosis-associated genes","strong inhibition of tissue injury","remarkable decrease","significant decrease","nuclear component","h nuclear immunoreactive products","number of apoptotic hepatocytes","time-dependent alteration","current findings","microarray analysis","nucleosome stabilization","addition","AST","glycyrrhizin","heart puncture","inflammatory infiltrates","transcription regulation","results","blood","inflammation","potential late mediator of lethality","TUNEL-method","real-time PCR","ChIP-assay","present study","basis","pericentral foci","lysine"],"language":"en"},

However, the disease is still potentially fatal. Missense induced MCADD is a protein misfolding disease with a molecular loss-of-function phenotype. Here we established a comprehensive experimental setup to analyze the structural consequences of eight ACADM missense mutations (p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, p.Lys329Glu, p.Arg334Lys, p.Arg413Ser) identified after newborn screening and linked the corresponding protein misfolding phenotype to the site of side-chain replacement with respect to the domain. With fever being the crucial risk factor for metabolic decompensation of patients with MCADD, special emphasis was put on the analysis of structural and functional derangements related to thermal stress. Based on protein conformation, thermal stability and kinetic stability, the molecular phenotype in MCADD depends on the structural region that is affected by missense-induced conformational changes with the central \u03B2-domain being particularly prone to structural derangement and destabilization. Since systematic classification of conformational derangements induced by ACADM mutations may be a helpful tool in assessing the clinical risk of patients, we scored the misfolding phenotype of the variants in comparison to p.Lys329Glu (K304E), the classical severe mutation, and p.Tyr67His (Y42H), discussed to be mild. Experiments assessing the impact of thermal stress revealed that mutations in the ACADM gene lower the temperature threshold at which MCAD loss-of-function occurs. Consequently, increased temperature as it occurs during intercurrent infections, significantly increases the risk of further conformational derangement and loss of function of the MCAD enzyme explaining the life-threatening clinical courses observed during fever episodes. Early and aggressive antipyretic treatment thus may be life-saving in patients suffering from MCADD.","publish_time":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jank, Johanna M.; Maier, Esther M.; Rei\u00DF, Dunja D.; Haslbeck, Martin; Kemter, Kristina F.; Truger, Marietta S.; Sommerhoff, Christian P.; Ferdinandusse, Sacha; Wanders, Ronald J.; Gersting, S\u00F8ren W.; Muntau, Ania C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0089aa4b17549b9774f13a9e2e12a84fc827d60b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3981736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACADM mutations","ACADM missense mutations","Missense induced MCADD","function phenotype","structural derangement","molecular phenotype","loss of function","ACADM gene","corresponding protein misfolding phenotype","protein misfolding disease","clinical risk of patients","molecular loss","thermal stability","MCAD loss","structural consequences","analysis of structural","structural region","protein conformation","Lys329Glu","Tyr67His","conformational changes","impact of thermal stress","systematic classification of conformational derangements","newborn screening programs","crucial risk factor","metabolic decompensation of patients","kinetic stability","MCAD enzyme","chain replacement","functional derangements","temperature threshold","fever episodes","increased temperature","life-threatening clinical courses","central \u03B2-domain","medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency","morbidity","Ala52Val","mortality","K304E","site","comparison","Arg206Cys","Tyr158His","Asp266Gly","classical severe mutation","helpful tool","variants","Arg413Ser","Arg334Lys","special emphasis","aggressive antipyretic treatment","comprehensive experimental setup","intercurrent infections","respect","implementation","Experiments","destabilization","Y42H"],"language":"en"},

LiT2 saw the large-scale industrialization of drug discovery using high-throughput screens and assays based on affinity for the target molecule. The links between drug development and university sciences and medicine weakened, but there were still some brilliant successes. In LiT3, the coverage of translational medicine expanded from molecular biology to drug budgets, with much greater emphasis on safety and official regulation. Compared with R\u0026D expenditure, the number of breakthrough discoveries in LiT3 was disappointing, but monoclonal antibodies for immunity and inflammation brought in a new golden era and kinase inhibitors such as imatinib were breakthroughs in cancer.

Here, we retrospectively review and compare national and local experiences with school closures in several countries during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Our intention is not to make a systematic review of country experiences; rather, it is to present the diversity of school closure experiences and provide examples from national and local perspectives. METHODS: Data were gathered during and following a meeting, organized by the European Centres for Disease Control, on school closures held in October 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden. A standard data collection form was developed and sent to all participants. The twelve participating countries and administrative regions (Bulgaria, China, France, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States) provided data. RESULTS: Our review highlights the very diverse national and local experiences on school closures during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The processes including who was in charge of making recommendations and who was in charge of making the decision to close, the school-based control strategies, the extent of school closures, the public health tradition of responses and expectations on school closure varied greatly between countries. Our review also discusses the many challenges associated with the implementation of this intervention and makes recommendations for further practical work in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The single most important factor to explain differences observed between countries may have been the different public health practises and public expectations concerning school closures and influenza in the selected countries.","publish_time":"2014-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cauchemez, Simon; Van Kerkhove, Maria D; Archer, Brett N; Cetron, Martin; Cowling, Benjamin J; Grove, Peter; Hunt, Darren; Kojouharova, Mira; Kon, Predrag; Ungchusak, Kumnuan; Oshitani, Hitoshi; Pugliese, Andrea; Rizzo, Caterina; Saour, Guillaume; Sunagawa, Tomimase; Uzicanin, Amra; Wachtel, Claude; Weisfuse, Isaac; Yu, Hongjie; Nicoll, Angus","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6446c4b30e5df7450e1a2b7c141daed4d413f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4021091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centres for Disease Control"],"locations":["Sweden","China","France","New Zealand","Serbia","South Africa","Thailand","United States"],"keyphrases":["extent of school closures","diversity of school closure experiences","local experiences","pdm09 pandemic","school-based control strategies","national pandemic plans","H1N1","participating countries","selected countries","public expectations","systematic review of country experiences","influenza","local perspectives","recommendations","charge","different public health practises","public health tradition of responses","administrative regions","United Kingdom","United States","Disease Control","standard data collection form","non-pharmaceutical intervention","Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","France","South Africa","SAR","China","Bulgaria","New Zealand","Serbia","Italy","Thailand","examples","Japan","start","important factor","European Centres","differences","considerable attention","practical work","CONCLUSIONS","implementation","BACKGROUND","area","event","meeting","challenges","Stockholm","decision","Sweden","intention","processes","METHODS","RESULTS","participants"],"language":"en"},

Some, but not all, previous studies have reported that low interferon responses in patients with asthma increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between lower airway inflammatory biomarkers, specifically interferon gene expression, and the severity or presence of an exacerbation in asthmatics experiencing a naturally occurring viral infection. METHODS: Sputum samples were analyzed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. RESULTS: IFN-\u03B3 expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.002). IFN-\u03B11, IFN-\u03B21, and IFN-\u03B3 mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r=0.58, p\u003C0.001; r=0.57, p=0.001; and r=0.51, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, IL-13, IL-10 and eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels were greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.03, p=0.06, and p=0.02, respectively), and IL-13 mRNA correlated with the peak Asthma Index (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that asthma exacerbations are associated with increased rather than decreased expression of interferons early in the course of infection. These findings raise the possibility that excessive virus-induced interferon production during acute infections can contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.","publish_time":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwantes, Elizabeth A.; Manthei, David M.; Denlinger, Loren C.; Evans, Michael D.; Gern, James E.; Jarjour, Nizar N.; Mathur, Sameer K.","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fd83ef7922963984411d069c4e2abcf0f4b4eec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f3ee67afa3aba69127b3d2aa261c7da12f38a803.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4037351.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4037351?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exacerbations of asthma","majority of asthma exacerbations","peak Asthma Index","asthma exacerbation study","virus-induced exacerbations","IFN-\u03B3 expression","non-exacerbating patients","interferon gene expression","IFN-\u03B3 mRNA levels","IFN-\u03B21","IFN-\u03B11","confirmed viral infection","decreased expression of interferons","viral respiratory infections","subjects","findings","course of infection","Sputum samples","excessive virus-induced interferon production","low interferon responses","eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels","peak expiratory flow rate","acute infections","airway inflammation","lower airway inflammatory biomarkers","medication use","possibility","severity","risk","daily symptoms","relationship","baseline","presence","asthmatics","cell","previous studies","RESULTS","RATIONALE","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

We wished to determine whether overexpression of the NF-\u03BAB inhibitor I\u03BAB\u03B1 could modulate the severity of acute and prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury in a series of prospective randomized animal studies. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to undergo intratracheal instillation of (a) 5 \u00D7 10(9 )adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors encoding the I\u03BAB\u03B1 transgene (5 \u00D7 10(9 )AAV-I\u03BAB\u03B1); (b) 1 \u00D7 10(10 )AAV-I\u03BAB\u03B1; (c) 5 \u00D7 10(10 )AAV-I\u03BAB\u03B1; or (d) vehicle alone.

Nevertheless, vvECMO is a procedure associated with high costs and resource utilization. The aim of this study was to assess published models for prediction of mortality following vvECMO and optimize an alternative model. METHODS: Established mortality risk scores were validated to assess their usefulness in 304 adult patients undergoing vvECMO for refractory lung failure at the University Medical Center Regensburg from 2008 to 2013. A parsimonious prediction model was developed based on variables available before ECMO initiation using logistic regression modelling. We then assessed whether addition of variables available one day after ECMO implementation enhanced mortality prediction. Models were internally validated and calibrated by bootstrapping (400 runs). Predictive ability, goodness-of-fit and model discrimination were compared across the different models. RESULTS: In the present study population, existing mortality prediction tools for vvECMO patients showed suboptimal performance. Evaluated before vvECMO initiation, a logistic prediction model comprising age, immunocompromised state, artificial minute ventilation, pre-ECMO serum lactate and hemoglobin concentrations showed best mortality prediction in our patients (area under curve, AUC: 0.75). Additional information about norepinephrine dosage, fraction of inspired oxygen, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations the first day following ECMO initiation further improved discrimination (AUC: 0.79, P = 0.03) and predictive ability (likelihood ratio test, P \u003C 0.001). When classifying patients as lower (\u003C40%) or higher (\u003E80%) risk based on their predicted mortality, the pre-ECMO and day1-on-ECMO models had negative/positive predictive values of 76%/82% and 82%/81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While pre-ECMO mortality prediction remains a challenge due to large patient heterogeneity, evaluation one day after ECMO initiation may improve the ability to separate lower- and higher-risk patients. Our findings support the clinical perception that chronic health condition, high comorbidity and reduced functional reserves are strongly related to survival during and following ECMO support. Renewed evaluation the first day after ECMO initiation may provide enhanced guidance for further handling of ECMO patients. Despite the usefulness of prediction models, thorough clinical evaluation should always represent the cornerstone in decision for ECMO.","publish_time":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enger, Tone Bull; Philipp, Alois; Videm, Vibeke; Lubnow, Matthias; Wahba, Alexander; Fischer, Marcus; Schmid, Christof; Bein, Thomas; M\u00FCller, Thomas","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf60af74d7fcf59daff65b588ec533a89dec64d2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8334f23b4bd0b20538a9e68a4f9db53e2a1d011f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/130902f35b947eb5bb5679f771f639e0a7fbc9a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057201.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECMO models","prediction of mortality","pre-ECMO mortality prediction","ECMO support","handling of ECMO patients","ECMO implementation","vvECMO patients","vvECMO initiation","best mortality prediction","usefulness of prediction models","logistic prediction model","parsimonious prediction model","pre-ECMO serum lactate","existing mortality prediction tools","predicted mortality","adult patients","higher-risk patients","Established mortality risk scores","model discrimination","Predictive ability","published models","different models","alternative model","refractory lung failure","thorough clinical evaluation","Renewed evaluation","AUC","addition of variables available","positive predictive values","severe acute lung failure refractory","hemoglobin concentrations","fibrinogen concentrations","high comorbidity","clinical perception","high costs","conventional therapy","improved discrimination","enhanced guidance","present study population","logistic regression modelling","artificial minute ventilation","immunocompromised state","fraction of inspired oxygen","C-reactive protein","chronic health condition","challenge","norepinephrine dosage","Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","large patient heterogeneity","University Medical Center Regensburg","likelihood ratio test","area","functional reserves","day1","suboptimal performance","Additional information","INTRODUCTION","procedure","survival","METHODS","goodness","cornerstone","CONCLUSIONS","resource utilization","findings","RESULTS","curve","life","bootstrapping","decision","runs","aim"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate how these levels correspond with the time at which the herds were infected. Bulk tank milk, individual milk and serum samples from cows and young stock were investigated using an indirect ELISA. Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly. This shows that the levels of antibodies in BTM can remain high for several years, even in herds where reinfection does not occur. BTM serology is a useful tool in the monitoring of infectious diseases in dairy herds, but has limitations as a diagnostic tool for BRSV infections.","publish_time":"2014-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klem, T.

Previous work has shown the H-(Hirsch-)index as an alternative proxy. We present a weighted risk analysis describing infectious pathogen impact for human health (human pathogens) and well-being (domestic animal pathogens) using an objective, evidence-based, repeatable approach; the H-index. This study established the highest H-index European pathogens. Commonalities amongst pathogens not included in previous surveillance or risk analyses were examined. Differences between host types (humans/animals/zoonotic) in pathogen H-indices were explored as a One Health impact indicator. Finally, the acceptability of the H-index proxy for animal pathogen impact was examined by comparison with other measures. 57 pathogens appeared solely in the top 100 highest H-indices (1) human or (2) animal pathogens list, and 43 occurred in both. Of human pathogens, 66 were zoonotic and 67 were emerging, compared to 67 and 57 for animals. There were statistically significant differences between H-indices for host types (humans, animal, zoonotic), and there was limited evidence that H-indices are a reasonable proxy for animal pathogen impact. This work addresses measures outlined by the European Commission to strengthen climate change resilience and biosecurity for infectious diseases. The results include a quantitative evaluation of infectious pathogen impact, and suggest greater impacts of human-only compared to zoonotic pathogens or scientific under-representation of zoonoses. The outputs separate high and low impact pathogens, and should be combined with other risk assessment methods relying on expert opinion or qualitative data for priority setting, or could be used to prioritise diseases for which formal risk assessments are not possible because of data gaps.","publish_time":"2014-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"McIntyre, K.

A number of haematological changes, especially thrombocytopaenia have been reported for P. vivax. Several host factors including cell-mediated immune cells, such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10 have been documented for P. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia. However, study on correlation of cytokines and thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax, particularly in patients with severe signs and symptoms has not been reported from Pakistan. METHODS: A case control study to correlate TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 in healthy controls and thrombocytopaenic P. vivax-infected patients (both uncomplicated and complicated cases) from southern Pakistan was carried out during January 2009 to December 2011. One Hundred and eighty two patients presenting with microscopy-confirmed asexual P. vivax mono-infection and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in the study at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed for determination of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 levels. RESULTS: Out of 182 cases, mild thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 100,000-150,000 mm(3)) was observed in ten (5.5%), moderate (50,000-100,000 mm(3)) in 93 (51.1%), and profound thrombocytopaenia (\u003C50,000 mm(3)) was detected in 79 (43.4%) patients. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were found approximately three-fold higher in the mild cases compared to healthy controls. Two-fold increase in TNF and IL-10 (p \u003C 0.0001) was observed in profound thrombocytopaenic when compared with moderate cases, while IL-6 was not found to be significantly elevated. CONCLUSION: Cytokines may have a possible role in P. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia in Pakistani population. Findings from this study give first insight from Pakistan on the role of cytokines in P.vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia. However, further studies are required to understand the relevance of cytokines in manifestations of thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria.","publish_time":"2014-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raza, Afsheen; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Ghanchi, Najia Karim; Raheem, Ahmed; Beg, Mohammad A","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5726297380b86a67cf694c0483d546051d1e8be6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4141950.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","Aga Khan University Hospital"],"locations":["southern Pakistan","Karachi"],"keyphrases":["vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia","vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia","vivax malaria","Plasmodium vivax","mild thrombocytopaenia","profound thrombocytopaenia","vivax-infected patients","manifestations of thrombocytopaenia","vivax mono-infection","mild cases","malaria cases","moderate cases","role of cytokines","complicated cases","healthy controls","relevance of cytokines","correlation of cytokines","southern Pakistan","case control study","determination of TNF","profound thrombocytopaenic","levels","possible role","fold increase","ELISA","Aga Khan University Hospital","immune cells","endemic causing","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Karachi","symptoms","microscopy","insight","Pakistani population","host factors","severe signs","METHODS","number of haematological changes","BACKGROUND","platelet","Findings","CONCLUSION","studies","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

HCV thyroid infection could act by upregulating CXCL10 gene expression and secretion in thyrocytes recruiting Th1 lymphocytes that secrete interferon-\u03B3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1. These cytokines might induce a further CXCL10 secretion by thyrocytes, thus perpetuating the immune cascade, which may lead to the appearance of autoimmune thyroid disorders in genetically predisposed subjects.

Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements.

Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are widely used for this task, modeling each subfamily separately by one pHMM. However, a major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of dealing with subfamilies composed of very few sequences. One of the most crucial bioinformatical tasks affected by the problem of small-size subfamilies is the subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences, i.e., HIV-1 subtypes for which only a small number of sequences is known. RESULTS: To deal with small samples for particular subfamilies of HIV-1, we introduce a novel model-based information sharing protocol. It estimates the emission probabilities of the pHMM modeling a particular subfamily not only based on the nucleotide frequencies of the respective subfamily but also incorporating the nucleotide frequencies of all available subfamilies. To this end, the underlying probabilistic model mimics the pattern of commonality and variation between the subtypes with regards to the biological characteristics of HI viruses. In order to implement the proposed protocol, we make use of an existing HMM architecture and its associated inference engine. CONCLUSIONS: We apply the modified algorithm to classify HIV-1 sequence data in the form of partial HIV-1 sequences and semi-artificial recombinants. Thereby, we demonstrate that the performance of pHMMs can be significantly improved by the proposed technique. Moreover, we show that our algorithm performs significantly better than Simplot and Bootscanning.","publish_time":"2014-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bulla, Ingo; Schultz, Anne-Kathrin; Chesneau, Christophe; Mark, Tanya; Serea, Florin","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e9340794956cfd47c9b84fb84100a42d8cc851c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7b8bf0fbd3e45c557ea348f85f72bae2e02d7095.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4230192.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4230192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particular subfamilies of HIV","size subfamilies","small number of sequences","available subfamilies","protein sequences","nucleotide frequencies","particular subfamily","form of partial HIV","problem of small","small samples","family of nucleotide","subtypes","respective subfamily","proposed protocol","novel model-based information","modified algorithm","performance of pHMMs","proposed technique","underlying probabilistic model","subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus type","architecture","regards","pattern of commonality","sequence data","biological characteristics of HI viruses","existing","Profile Hidden Markov Models","variation","semi-artificial recombinants","associated inference engine","crucial bioinformatical tasks","approach","Simplot","end","applications","difficulty","major drawback","emission probabilities","Bootscanning","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","order","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public health data for science and policy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts. We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international dialogue on solutions. RESULTS: Twenty potential barriers were identified and classified in six categories: technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical. The first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous effect of multiple interacting barriers ranging from technical to intangible issues has greatly complicated advances in public health data sharing. A systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health will be essential to accelerate the use of valuable information for the global good.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. METHODS: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. RESULTS: Some surveillance systems \u2014 especially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreak \u2014 are more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.

Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug\u2013drug interactions via the chemical\u2013protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1\u2032-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1\u2032-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Junhui; Chang, Cui; Xiang, Qi; Zhou, Zhi-Wei; Luo, Rong; Yang, Lun; He, Zhi-Xu; Yang, Hongtu; Li, Jianan; Bei, Yu; Xu, Jinmei; Zhang, Minjing; Zhang, Qihao; Su, Zhijian; Huang, Yadong; Pang, Jiyan; Zhou, Shu-Feng","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e8abc62533a447422d5ead64d4ae4991cc99052.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4271727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["XKB","Integrated Discovery"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predicted targets of XKB","oral administration of XKB","regulating effect of XKB","potential molecular targets of XKB","expression of hepatic Cyp3a","expression of Cyp3a members","expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a","OH-midazolam","rats","Cyp3a subfamily members","Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam","activity of rat cytochrome P450","drug interactions","pathways","molecular docking study","networks of molecular proteins","rat Cyp3a2 homology model","plasma clearance","drug-metabolizing enzymes","mechanisms of action","consecutive days","plasma concentration-time curve","model probe","AUC ratio","Integrated Discovery","Homology modeling","cardioprotective effects","bioinformatic approaches","functional proteins","Bioinformatic analysis","active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4","Discovery Studio program","potent antioxidative","mangrove fungus Xylaria","novel marine compound","Visualization","Annotation","chemical","Database","metabolite","modulation","treatment of illnesses","health promotion","validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method","concomitant decrease","underlying mechanism","formation of hydrogen bonds","safety profiles","area","server","protein interactome","DAVID","Natural compounds","Xyloketal B","DDI-CPI","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

Although several promising therapeutic agents and vaccines against EBOV are undergoing the Phase I human trial, the current epidemic might be outpacing the speed at which drugs and vaccines can be produced.

To investigate the effect of the H74L mutation on the in vivo CTL priming, we took advantage of the technology of the HLA class I single-chain trimer (SCT) in which three components involving a peptide, \u03B22 microglobulin and the HLA class I heavy chain are joined together via flexible linkers. We generated recombinant adenovirus expressing SCT comprised influenza A matrix protein (FMP)-derived peptide, \u03B22 microglobulin and the H74L heavy chain. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were immunized with the adenovirus, and the induction of peptide-specific CTLs and antitumor immunity was investigated. It was clearly shown that the H74L mutation enabled the HLA-A*02:01 SCT molecule to dramatically enhance both in vivo priming of FMP-specific CTLs and protection against a lethal challenge of tumor cells expressing FMP.

HCV exploits complex molecular mechanisms, which result in a high degree of intrahost genetic heterogeneity. This high degree of variability represents a challenge for the accurate establishment of genetic relatedness between cases and complicates the identification of sources of infection. Tracking HCV infections is crucial for the elucidation of routes of transmission in a variety of settings. Therefore, implementation of HCV advanced molecular surveillance (AMS) is essential for disease control. Accounting for virulence is also important for HCV AMS and both viral and host factors contribute to the disease outcome. Therefore, HCV AMS requires the incorporation of host factors as an integral component of the algorithms used to monitor disease occurrence. Importantly, implementation of comprehensive global databases and data mining are also needed for the proper study of the mechanisms responsible for HCV transmission. Here, we review molecular aspects associated with HCV transmission, as well as the most recent technological advances used for virus and host characterization. Additionally, the cornerstone discoveries that have defined the pathway for viral characterization are presented and the importance of implementing advanced HCV molecular surveillance is highlighted.","publish_time":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gon\u00E7alves Rossi, Livia Maria; Escobar-Gutierrez, Alejandro; Rahal, Paula","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a007977dad90a07b3beb9f689e3be8b3f7d2a7f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4379565.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","HCV AMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV AMS","HCV transmission","advanced HCV molecular surveillance","implementation of HCV advanced molecular surveillance","Tracking HCV infections","host characterization","molecular aspects","complex molecular mechanisms","incorporation of host factors","viral characterization","disease control","disease outcome","disease occurrence","high degree of variability","high degree of intrahost genetic heterogeneity","mechanisms responsible","Hepatitis C virus","accurate establishment of genetic relatedness","implementation of comprehensive global databases","important public health problem","cases","challenge","importance","data mining","integral component","elucidation of routes","algorithms","pathway","proper study","recent technological advances","virulence","identification of sources","variety of settings","cornerstone discoveries","Accounting"],"language":"en"},

Recent research suggests that sepsis is likely to be due to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic mutations of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) genes are involved in the immune and (or) inflammatory response. These may contribute to the susceptibility to sepsis in patients. This study was designed to evaluate whether the TLR4 and cluster CD14 gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to sepsis. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR4 (rs10759932, rs11536889, rs7873784, rs12377632, rs1927907, rs1153879) and CD14 (rs2569190 and rs2563298) in patients with sepsis and control subjects in the Guangxi Province were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction-single base extension (PCR-SBE) and DNA sequencing methods. RESULTS: The rs11536889 polymorphism in TLR4 and rs2563298 polymorphism in CD14 were significantly associated with the risk of sepsis when compared to the control group. The frequencies of rs11536889 and rs2563298 polymorphisms in the group with sepsis were higher than that in the control group (OR = 1.430, 95% CI, 1.032-1.981, P\u003C0.05; OR = 2.454, 95% CI, 1.458-4.130, P\u003C0.05, respectively). Followed up haplotype analysis suggested that there were two haplotypes in which increased risk factors for sepsis were indicated.

Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23\u00B0C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.","publish_time":"2015-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gustin, Kortney M.; Belser, Jessica A.; Veguilla, Vic; Zeng, Hui; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Maines, Taronna R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60f1a9fff7e34e6a528a2a06dedb23700c87e114.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4430532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission of influenza virus","etiologic virus","seasonal H3N2 virus","influenza virus infectivity","frequency of influenza virus transmission","seasonality of influenza virus infections","levels of infectious virus","increased levels of H3N2 variant virus","influenza viruses","different environmental conditions","role of environmental conditions","humidity conditions","respiratory droplet transmission","environmental settings","different temperature","infected ferrets","air","exhaled aerosol samples","enhanced capabilities","profiles of infected animals","ferret nasal wash","temperate climates","swine","aerosols","human summertime infection","ways","public","RH","understanding","results","Comparisons"],"language":"en"},

Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT(2) receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT(2) receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.","publish_time":"2015-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weidemann, Benjamin J.; Voong, Susan; Morales-Santiago, Fabiola I.; Kahn, Michael Z.; Ni, Jonathan; Littlejohn, Nicole K.; Claflin, Kristin E.; Burnett, Colin M.L.; Pearson, Nicole A.; Lutter, Michael L.; Grobe, Justin L.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f8c204d73feaf62ba6caa3be033d007e3134d5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4464075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4464075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of digestive efficiency","suppressed digestive efficiency","importance of digestive efficiency","uniform assessment of digestive efficiency","dietary sodium content","effects of high dietary sodium","suppressive effect of dietary sodium","low sodium","Dietary fats","receptor antagonist PD","receptor antagonist losartan","NCrl mice","J mice","weight gain","high fat diet","standard chow diet","pathogenesis of obesity","ingestive behavior","food intake behavior","Replacement of circulating angiotensin","renin-angiotensin system","greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology","prompt","physical activity","levels","mouse strain","animal studies of energy balance","need","macronutrient composition","hypothesis","C57BL","FVB","resting metabolism","findings","data","reduction","genetic deletion"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that both Apol9 isoforms (Apol9b and Apol9a) inhibit replication of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) but not replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), or infection by a lentiviral vector. Apol9 genes are strongly expressed in mouse liver and, to a lesser extent, in pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine. Their expression is increased by type I interferon and viral infection. In contrast to genuine apolipoproteins that are involved in lipid transport, ApoL9 has an intracytoplasmic localization and does not seem to be secreted. The cytoplasmic localization of ApoL9 is in line with the observation that ApoL9 inhibits the replication step of TMEV infection. In contrast to human ApoL6, ApoL9 did not sensitize cells to apoptosis, in spite of the presence of a conserved putative BH3 domain, required for antiviral activity. ApoL9a and b isoforms interact with cellular prohibitin 1 (Phb1) and prohibitin 2 (Phb2) and this interaction might contribute to ApoL9 antiviral activity. Knocking down Phb2 slightly increased TMEV replication, irrespective of ApoL9 overexpression. The antiviral activity of prohibitins against TMEV contrasts with the pro-viral activity of prohibitins observed for VSV and reported previously for Dengue 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and influenza H5N1 viruses. ApoL9 is thus an example of ISG displaying a narrow antiviral range, which likely acts in complex with prohibitins to restrict TMEV replication.","publish_time":"2015-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kreit, Marguerite; Vertommen, Didier; Gillet, Laurent; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25a160364a2e056a097e4520f64c49c63140da6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4510265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Apolipoprotein"],"organizations":["TMEV","VSV","Dengue","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ApoL9 antiviral activity","Apol9 isoforms","Apol9 genes","ApoL9 overexpression","antiviral activity of prohibitins","increased TMEV replication","cytoplasmic localization of ApoL9","replication step of TMEV infection","TMEV contrasts","pro-viral activity of prohibitins","viral infection","narrow antiviral range","replication of vesicular stomatitis virus","replication of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus","VSV","Apol9a","Apol9b","Phb2","example of ISG","cellular prohibitin","mouse liver","b isoforms","intracytoplasmic localization","interferon-stimulated gene","primary mouse neurons","presence","conserved putative BH3 domain","pancreas","lesser extent","lipid transport","line","observation","adipose tissue","Murid herpesvirus","Chikungunya","CHIKV","spite","cells","apoptosis","Phb1","complex","influenza H5N1 viruses","interaction","genuine apolipoproteins","human ApoL6","intestine","MuHV","cell types","Apolipoprotein L9b","DENV","Dengue","lentiviral vector"],"language":"en"},

Symptoms of T cell exhaustion range from expression of inhibitory receptors and selective loss of cytokine production capacity through reduced proliferative potential, impaired differentiation into effector cells and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) durably reduces HIV viremia to undetectable levels, this alone does not restore the full pluripotency of HIV-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. In a number of studies, a subset of peptide epitope variants categorized as heteroclitic, restimulated more potent cellular immune responses in vitro than did the native, immunizing peptides themselves. This property of heteroclitic peptides has been exploited in experimental cancer and chronic viral infection models to promote clearance of transformed cells and persistent viruses. In this review, we consider the possibility that heteroclitic peptides could improve the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines as part of HIV immunotherapy or eradication strategies. We review literature on heteroclitic peptides and illustrate their potential to beneficially modulate the nature of HIV-specific T cell responses toward those found in the small minority of HIV-infected, aviremic cART-na\u00EFve persons termed elite controllers or long-term non-progressors.

Although CNS infection by highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been demonstrated, it is unknown whether H5N1 infects neural progenitor cells, nor whether such infection plays a role in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To pursue this question, we infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells in vitro with H5N1 virus, and studied the resulting cytopathology, cytokine expression, and genes involved in the differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (BG01) were maintained and differentiated into the neural progenitors, and then infected by H5N1 virus (A/Chicken/Thailand/CUK2/04) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. At 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection (hpi), cytopathic effects were observed. Then cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, supernatants quantified for virus titers, and sampled cells studied for candidate genes.The hNPCs were susceptible to H5N1 virus infection as determined by morphological observation and immunofluorescence. The infection was characterized by a significant up-regulation of TNF-\u03B1 gene expression, while expressions of IFN-\u03B12, IFN-\u03B21, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-6 remained unchanged compared to mock-infected controls. Moreover, H5N1 infection did not appear to alter expression of neuronal and astrocytic markers of hNPCs, such as \u03B2-III tubulin and GFAP, respectively.

Most HIV-1 infected individuals worldwide are women, who acquire HIV infections during sexual contact. Blocking HIV mucosal transmission and local spread in the female lower genital tract is important in preventing infection and ultimately eliminating the pandemic. Microbicides work by destroying the microbes or preventing them from establishing an infection. Thus, a number of different types of microbicides are under investigation, however, the lack of their solubility and bioavailability, and toxicity has been major hurdles. Herein, we report the development of multifunctional chitosan-lipid nanocomplexes that can effectively deliver plasmids encoding siRNA(s) as microbicides without adverse effects and provide significant protection against HIV in both in vitro and in vivo models. Chitosan or chitosan-lipid (chlipid) was complexed with a cocktail of plasmids encoding HIV-1-specific siRNAs (psiRNAs) and evaluated for their efficacy in HEK-293 cells, PBMCs derived from nonhuman primates, 3-dimensional human vaginal ectocervical tissue (3D-VEC) model and also in non-human primate model. Moreover, prophylactic administration of the chlipid to deliver a psiRNA cocktail intravaginally with a cream formulation in a non-human primate model showed substantial reduction of SHIV (simian/human immunodeficiency virus SF162) viral titers. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the potential of chlipid-siRNA nanocomplexes as a potential genetic microbicide against HIV infections.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyapalle, Sandhya; Xu, Weidong; Raulji, Payal; Mohapatra, Subhra; Mohapatra, Shyam S","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5360f18c21cf7f9a04e9b21663301b4548eadd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4583459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV infections","HIV mucosal transmission","non-human primate model","human immunodeficiency virus SF162","potential of chlipid","siRNA nanocomplexes","cocktail of plasmids","Microbicides work","dimensional human vaginal ectocervical tissue","development of multifunctional chitosan-lipid nanocomplexes","number of different types of microbicides","psiRNA cocktail","potential genetic microbicide","local spread","substantial reduction of SHIV","simian","female lower genital tract","cream formulation","nonhuman primates","adverse effects","D-VEC","cells","viral titers","significant protection","toxicity","bioavailability","PBMCs","investigation","women","specific siRNAs","solubility","efficacy","lack","psiRNAs","HEK","infected individuals","sexual contact","major hurdles","etiologic agents of AIDS","microbes","prophylactic administration","studies","pandemic","models"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrated that three subtypes of aMPV (aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C) F proteins promoted cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin. Indeed, in the presence of trypsin, only aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was enhanced. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at position 100 and/or 101, located at a putative cleavage region in aMPV F proteins, revealed that the trypsin-mediated fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins is regulated by the residues at positions 100 and 101. Moreover, we demonstrated that aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins mediated cell-cell fusion independent of low pH, whereas the aMPV/C F protein did not. Mutagenesis of the residue at position 294 in the aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins showed that 294G played a critical role in F protein-mediated fusion under low pH conditions.

Early electron microscopy studies of morphological changes following viral infection are re-considered in light of more recent data on viral manipulation of lipid and protein biosynthesis.

Because of slower antigenic drift in swine, the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing. It remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross\u2010protection between recent human and swine H3N2 influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether prior infection of pigs with an old [A/Victoria/3/75 (A/Vic/75)] or a more recent [A/Wisconsin/67/05 (A/Wis/05)] human H3N2 virus protected against a European swine H3N2 virus [sw/Gent/172/08 (sw/Gent/08)]. Genetic and antigenic relationships between sw/Gent/08 and a selection of human H3N2 viruses were also assessed. RESULTS: After challenge with sw/Gent/08, all challenge controls had high virus titers in the entire respiratory tract at 3 days post\u2010challenge and nasal virus excretion for 5\u20136 days. Prior infection with sw/Gent/08 or A/Vic/75 offered complete virological protection against challenge. Pigs previously inoculated with A/Wis/05 showed similar virus titers in the respiratory tract as challenge controls, but the mean duration of nasal shedding was 1\u00B73 days shorter. Unlike sw/Gent/08\u2010 and A/Vic/75\u2010inoculated pigs, A/Wis/05\u2010inoculated pigs lacked cross\u2010reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/Gent/08 before challenge, but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/Gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge. Cross\u2010protection and serological responses correlated with genetic and antigenic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Infection immunity to a recent human H3N2 virus confers minimal cross\u2010protection against a European swine H3N2 virus.

The policy frames identified responded to the challenges these regions currently face.

More interestingly, selective CD11c(hi) DC ablation provided altered differentiation and function of infiltrated CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the CNS through Flt3-L and GM-CSF, which was closely associated with severely enhanced neuroinflammation. Furthermore, CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes generated in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated environment had a deleterious rather than protective role during neuroinflammation, and were more quickly recruited into inflamed CNS, depending on CCR2, thereby exacerbating neuroinflammation via enhanced supply of virus from the periphery.

In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 \u03BCm. Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143). When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7); after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6). The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042). The average number of particles expelled per cough varied widely from patient to patient, ranging from 900 to 302,200 particles/cough while subjects had influenza and 1100 to 308,600 particles/cough after recovery. When the subjects had influenza, an average of 63% of each subject\u0027s cough aerosol particle volume in the detection range was in the respirable size fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person. This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.

In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen\u2019s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mondal, Shakhinur Islam; Ferdous, Sabiha; Jewel, Nurnabi Azad; Akter, Arzuba; Mahmud, Zabed; Islam, Md Muzahidul; Afrin, Tanzila; Karim, Nurul","journal":"Adv Appl Bioinform Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53f9b02ce4cc149507a9d402dcf9d4c191b3bb29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4677596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel drug targets","potential drug targets","H7","identified drug targets","novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets","Escherichia coli O157","human proteins","potential druggability","metabolic pathways analysis","putative target proteins","deadly human bacterial pathogens","human host","potential inhibitors","study","suitable ligands of dnaE","non-homologous essential proteins of","additional drug prioritizing parameters","Bacterial enteric infections","deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea","enteric fever","comparative genomics","silico workflow","silico docking","D structure","H-tetrazol","H-xanthene","Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","extensive computational approaches","bio-informatic approaches","D structural characteristics","compounds N-coeleneterazine","hemolytic uremic syndrome","DNA polymerase","prediction of subcellular localization","calculation of molecular weight","web-based investigation","Genomes","effective drugs","release of new","dysentery","pathogen\u2019s survival","alpha","huge public health problem","discovery","sulfon","eligibility","similarity","ylidene","oxo","dihydro","DrugBank database","episodes of disease","developed countries","results"],"language":"en"},

The 190 kb GpSGHV genome contains 160 open reading frames and encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins. The asymptomatic GpSGHV infection in flies can convert to symptomatic infection that is characterized by overt salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH). Flies with SGH show reduced general fitness and reproductive dysfunction. Although the occurrence of SGH is an exception rather than the rule, G. pallidipes is thought to be the most susceptible to expression of overt SGH symptoms compared to other Glossina species that are largely asymptomatic. Although Glossina salivary glands (SGs) play an essential role in GpSGHV transmission, the functions of the salivary components during the virus infection are poorly understood. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to study SG proteomes of G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, two Glossina model species that exhibit differential GpSGHV pathologies (high and low incidence of SGH, respectively). A total of 540 host proteins were identified, of which 23 and 9 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in G. pallidipes compared to G. m. morsitans. Whereas 58 GpSGHV proteins were detected in G. pallidipes F(1) progenies, only 5 viral proteins were detected in G. m. morsitans. Unlike in G. pallidipes, qPCR assay did not show any significant increase in virus titers in G. m. morsitans F(1) progenies, confirming that G. m. morsitans is less susceptible to GpSGHV infection and replication compared to G. pallidipes. Based on our results, we speculate that in the case of G. pallidipes, GpSGHV employs a repertoire of host intracellular signaling pathways for successful infection. In the case of G. m. morsitans, antiviral responses appeared to be dominant. These results are useful for designing additional tools to investigate the Glossina-GpSGHV interactions.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kariithi, Henry M.; \u0130nce, \u0130kbal Agah; Boeren, Sjef; Murungi, Edwin K.; Meki, Irene K.; Otieno, Everlyne A.; Nyanjom, Steven R.

To explore its potential effectiveness on streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy, male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control and a diabetic model. After 1 week, the diabetic rats were divided into four subgroups (each with 15 rats) for 14-week treatments with saline, olmesartan, ATRQ\u03B2-001, and Q\u03B2 virus-like particle (VLP), respectively. In addition to lower blood pressure, ATRQ\u03B2-001 vaccination ameliorated biochemical parameter changes of renal dysfunction, mesangial expansion, and fibrosis through inhibiting oxidative stress, macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory factor expression. Furthermore, ATRQ\u03B2-001 vaccination suppressed renal Ang II-AT1R activation and abrogated the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-Ang (1\u20137), similar to olmesartan treatment, while no obvious feedback activation of circulating or local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was only observed in vaccine group. In rat mesangial cells, the anti-ATR-001 antibody inhibited high glucose-induced transforming growth factor-\u03B21 (TGF)-\u03B21/Smad3 signal pathway. Additionally, no significant immune-mediated damage was detected in vaccinated animals. In conclusion, the ATRQ\u03B2-001 vaccine ameliorated streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal injury via modulating two RAS axes and inhibiting TGF-\u03B21/Smad3 signal pathway, providing a novel, safe, and promising method to treat diabetic nephropathy. KEY MESSAGES: Overactivation of RAS plays a crucial role in the development of the DN. Our aim was to verify the effectiveness of ATRQ\u03B2-001 vaccine in STZ-induced DN. The ATRQ\u03B2-001 modulated two RAS axes and inhibited TGF-\u03B21/Smad3 signal pathway. The vaccine therapy may provide a novel, safe, and promising method to treat DN.

In contrast, the vaccine schedule which provided fully protective immunity in young adult mice conferred limited protection in aged mice. Antigen presenting cells from aged mice were found to be less responsive to in vitro stimulation by Fluzone and CpG which may partially explain this result.

METHODS: We defined an adult SARI case as a hospitalized patient aged \u2265 15 years with temperature \u226538.0\u00B0C and at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, abnormal breath sounds on auscultation, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia. For each enrolled SARI case-patient, we completed a standardized case report form, and collected a nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours of admission. Specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We analyzed data from adult SARI cases in four hospitals in Jingzhou, China from April 2010 to April 2012. RESULTS: Of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were aged \u2265 65 years old. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days. Nearly all were prescribed antibiotics during their hospitalization, less than 1% were prescribed oseltamivir, and 28% were prescribed corticosteroids. Only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. Of 1,704 samples tested, 16% were positive for influenza. Influenza activity in all age groups showed winter-spring and summer peaks. Influenza-positive patients had a longer duration from illness onset to hospitalization and a shorter duration from hospital admission to discharge or death compared to influenza negative SARI patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Jingzhou, China, especially among older adults.

A novel T-cell-receptor (TCR)-like single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific for the T-cell epitope consisting of the WT1/HLA-A2 complex was isolated from a human scFv phage library. This scFv was affinity-matured by mutagenesis combined with yeast display and structurally analyzed using a homology model. This monovalent scFv showed a 100-fold affinity improvement (dissociation constant (K(D))=3 nm) and exquisite specificity towards its targeted epitope or HLA-A2(\u002B)/WT1(\u002B) tumor cells. Bivalent scFv-huIgG1-Fc fusion protein demonstrated an even higher avidity (K(D)=2 pm) binding to the T-cell epitope and to tumor targets and was capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or tumor lysis by chimeric antigen receptor-expressing human T- or NK-92-MI-transfected cells. This antibody demonstrated specific and potent cytotoxicity in vivo towards WT1-positive leukemia xenograft that was HLA-A2 restricted. In summary, T-cell epitopes can provide novel targets for antibody-based therapeutics. By combining phage and yeast displays and scFv-Fc fusion platforms, a strategy for developing high-affinity TCR-like antibodies could be rapidly explored for potential clinical development.

In this study we analyzed the complete genome sequences of 122 SFTSV strains to determine the phylogeny, evolution and reassortment of the virus. We revealed that the evolutionary rate of three genome segments were different, with highest in the S segment and lowest in the L segment. The SFTSV strains were phylogenetically classified into 5 lineages (A, B, C, D and E) with each genome segment. SFTSV strains from China were classified in all 5 lineages, strains from South Korea were classified into 3 lineages (A, D, and E), and all strains from Japan were classified in only linage E. Using the average evolutionary rate of the three genome segments, we found that the extant SFTSV originated 20\u201387 years ago in the Dabie Mountain area in central China. The viruses were then transmitted to other areas of China, Japan and South Korea. We also found that six SFTSV strains were reassortants. Selection pressure analysis suggested that SFTSV was under purifying selection according to the four genes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, non-structural protein), and two sites (37, 1033) of glycoproteins were identified as being under strong positive selection. We concluded that SFTSV originated in central China and spread to other places recently and the virus was under purifying selection with high frequency of reassortment.","publish_time":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jian-Wei; Zhao, Li; Luo, Li-Mei; Liu, Miao-Miao; Sun, Yue; Su, Xiang; Yu, Xue-jie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/954b14cdbef3607bb5f401ebdd69b2306c2ee483.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4801363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4801363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["East Asia","China","Dabie Mountain","Japan","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["SFTSV strains","extant SFTSV","genome segments","purifying selection","central China","lineages","areas of China","high fatality rate","average evolutionary rate","complete genome sequences","South Korea","Selection pressure analysis","S segment","strong positive selection","Japan","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","high frequency of reassortment","hemorrhagic fever","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","nucleocapsid protein","non-structural protein","Severe fever","genes","novel tick-borne bunyavirus","years","Dabie Mountain area","East Asia","linage","phylogeny","sites","study","places","glycoproteins","reassortants","viruses"],"language":"en"},

This paper is an attempt to illustrate the potential impact of the new surveillance system through a description of the existing surveillance system and data before and after the revision. METHODS: After a historical review of surveillance system in Japan, the current surveillance system is described. Data sets of actual case numbers reported and incidence rate per 1,000,000 population are compared before and after the revision. RESULTS: Comparison of the data between the 2 periods revealed that most of the diseases have had declining trends after the new law was enacted with several exceptions. However, although no major break in continuity is observed in seriously perceived disease, in milder diseases there are striking gaps between the numbers reported in the mandatory and sentinel reporting framework. Sentinel reporting framework maintained the continuity of data without major gaps. CONCLUSIONS: From this perspective, the new surveillance system with two different frameworks of mandatory reporting for severe diseases and sentinel reporting for milder diseases seems to be working well. But continuous efforts should be made for evaluation and improvement of surveillance system and risk communication through the research on data analysis and effective communication method.","publish_time":"2008-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Hashimoto, Shuji; Kawado, Miyuki; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Izumida, Michiko; Ohta, Akiko; Tada, Yuki; Shigematsu, Mika; Yasui, Yoshinori; Nagai, Masaki","journal":"J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8ee195be637c05754e714310c9d0d5ba715d683.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4809251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Communicable Disease Prevention Law of Japan"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new surveillance system","improvement of surveillance system","existing surveillance system","current surveillance system","importance of surveillance","historical review of surveillance system","continuity of data","new law","milder diseases","data analysis","sentinel reporting framework","severe diseases","different frameworks of mandatory reporting","Data sets of actual case numbers","Communicable Disease Prevention Law of Japan","Infectious Disease Control Law","perceived disease","major gaps","revision","risk communication","striking gaps","major break","effective communication method","research","description","information dissemination","incidence rate","evaluation","potential impact","declining trends","perspective","attempt","continuous efforts","population","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Comparison","exceptions","periods","paper","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. In this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves of differing strains using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic. METHODS: We make use of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Prevention influenza surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed subtyping of samples and a mathematical model to determine the waves of circulating (and co-circulating) H1, H3 and B virus strains in Taiwan during 2008\u20132014; or namely, short before, during and after the 2009 pandemic. We further pinpoint the turning points and relative transmissibility of each wave, in order to ascertain whether any temporal pattern exists. RESULTS/FINDINGS: For two consecutive years following the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in Taiwan (as in most of Northern Hemisphere), sometimes co-circulating with AH3. From the evolution point of view, A(H1N1)pdm09 and AH3 were able to sustain their circulation patterns to the end of 2010. In fact, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in six separate waves in Taiwan between summer of 2009 and spring of 2014. Since 2009, a wave of A(H1N1)pmd09 occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011\u20132012 season, when mainly influenza strain B circulated. In comparing transmissibility, while the estimated per capita weekly growth rates for cumulative case numbers (and the reproduction number) seem to be lower for most of the influenza B waves (0.06~0.26; range of 95% CIs: 0.05~0.32) when compared to those of influenza A, the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher at r = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected in this study. Moreover, when AH3 or A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibit high incidence, reported cases of subtype B decreases and vice versa. Further modeling analysis indicated that during the study period, Taiwan nearly experienced at least one wave of influenza epidemic of some strain every summer except in 2012. DISCUSSION: Estimates of R for seasonal influenza are consistent with that of temperate and tropical-subtropical regions, while estimate of R for A(H1N1)pdm09 is comparatively less than countries in Europe and North America, but similar to that of tropical-subtropical regions. This offers indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza. Despite obvious limitations in the data used, this study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, to possibly provide predictors of future trends in the evolution of influenza viruses of various subtypes, and perhaps more importantly, to be of use to future annual seasonal influenza vaccine design.","publish_time":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Huang, Hsiang-Min; Lan, Yu-Ching","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377d9d0d1f580860076b5799e30babd834eda260.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4854472.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["strains of pandemic influenza","influenza B waves","wave of influenza B","various influenza strains","transmissibility of influenza virus","influenza strain B","H1N1","influenza subtyping data","wave of influenza epidemic","Taiwan influenza surveillance data","winter influenza season","pdm09 pandemic","circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains","Prevention influenza surveillance data","seasonal waves","waves of circulating","waves of different strains","pdm09 virus","waves of differing strains","B virus strains","evolution of influenza viruses of various subtypes","future annual seasonal influenza vaccine design","separate waves","Taiwan Center","relative transmissibility","winter wave","post-pandemic years","different patterns","study period","temporal patterns","AH3","co-circulating","cases of subtype B decreases","Estimates of R","fall","tropical-subtropical regions","summer","subtyping of samples","consecutive years","fact highest","predictors of future trends","evolution point of view","Disease Control","cumulative case numbers","weekly growth rates","laboratory","high incidence","impact","pmd09","reproduction number","mathematical model","indication of regional differences","Europe","North America","countries","order","Northern Hemisphere","turning points","FINDINGS","DISCUSSION","mechanism","modeling analysis","RESULTS","issue","obvious limitations","range","spring","Recent studies","work","CIs","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, twenty-first century states are increasingly concerned that this data could also be used for purposes of bioterrorism. There is thus a tension between the desire to promote the sharing of data, as encapsulated by the Open Data movement, and the desire to prevent this data from \u2018falling into the wrong hands\u2019 as represented by \u2018dual use\u2019 policies. Both frameworks posit a moral duty for life sciences researchers with respect to how they should make their data available. However, Open data and dual use concerns are rarely discussed in concert and their implementation can present scientists with potentially conflicting ethical requirements. DISCUSSION: Both dual use and Open data policies frame scientific data and data dissemination in particular, though different, ways. As such they contain implicit models for how data is translated. Both approaches are limited by a focus on abstract conceptions of data and data sharing. This works to impede consensus-building between the two ethical frameworks. As an alternative, this paper proposes that an ethics of responsible management of scientific data should be based on a more nuanced understanding of the everyday data practices of life scientists. Responsibility for these \u2018micromovements\u2019 of data must consider the needs and duties of scientists as individuals and as collectively-organised groups. SUMMARY: Researchers in the life sciences are faced with conflicting ethical responsibilities to share data as widely as possible, but prevent it being used for bioterrorist purposes. In order to reconcile the responsibilities posed by the Open Data and dual use frameworks, approaches should focus more on the everyday practices of laboratory scientists and less on abstract conceptions of data.","publish_time":"2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezuidenhout, Louise M.; Morrison, Michael","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f2a4d172b340b6f695a3f44bb746edcccb47d14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4869374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Open Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sharing of data","data sharing","data dissemination","biomedical data","data available","Open data policies frame scientific data","Open Data movement","abstract conceptions of data","everyday data practices of life scientists","ethics of responsible management of scientific data","dual use frameworks","dual use concerns","ethical frameworks","duties of scientists","life sciences researchers","conflicting ethical responsibilities","everyday practices of laboratory scientists","conflicting ethical requirements","desire","approaches","focus","facilitating translation of scientific discoveries","Responsible Datal","widespread sharing of biologicaConcluding Comments","purposes of bioterrorism","bioterrorist purposes","novel clinical applications","key element","moral duty","individuals","services","respect","concert","needs","nuanced understanding","paper","BACKGROUND","implementation","SUMMARY","wrong hands\u2019","DISCUSSION","century states","time","organised groups","ways","micromovements","implicit models","Responsibility","alternative","order","tension","consensus"],"language":"en"},

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology to define genomic sequences of the viruses. Of particular interest is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to perform phylogeographic analysis, that allows the detection and tracking of the emergence of viral infections. Hantaviruses, Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. We propose to use WGS for the phylogeographic analysis of human hantavirus infections. A novel multiplex PCR-based NGS was developed to gather whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from HFRS patients and rodent hosts in endemic areas. The obtained genomes were described for the spatial and temporal links between cases and their sources. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated geographic clustering of HTNV strains from clinical specimens with the HTNV strains circulating in rodents, suggesting the most likely site and time of infection. Recombination analysis demonstrated a genome organization compatible with recombination of the HTNV S segment.

Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive and specific RPA-based detection system for Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield (RR2Y) material in soybean (Glycine max) seed samples and present the results of studies applying the method in both laboratory and field-type settings.","publish_time":"2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandu, Dilip; Paul, Sudakshina; Parker, Mathew; Dudin, Yelena; King-Sitzes, Jennifer; Perez, Tim; Mittanck, Don W.; Shah, Manali; Glenn, Kevin C.; Piepenburg, Olaf","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/491f000353cbe2d030d16077ecb01f02d7c6bf3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4899603.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899603/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seed samples","seed manufacturers","laboratory","use of minimal detection equipment","recombinase polymerase amplification","specific RPA-based detection system","amplification work-flow procedures","isothermal DNA amplification technique","modified material","expensive equipment","rapid antibody-based testing","new diagnostic regimen","introduction of new variants","Genuity Roundup Ready","distinguishing different traits","RR2Y","Yield","soybean","given transgene","simple sample preparation","requirement","sophisticated operation","Glycine max","agricultural industry","growers","critical importance","nucleic acid level","transgenic protein","real time","need","stakeholders","PCR","method","past","results of studies","presence","regulatory bodies","field-type settings","point"],"language":"en"},

This article constitutes a risk-based review aimed at supporting an etiologic scenario of selected, sporadic, protein-associated, i.e., conformational, neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), and their vascular- and metabolic-associated ailments. Methods: A rationale is adopted, to incorporate selected clinical data and results from animal-model research, complementing epidemiologic evidences reported in two prior articles. Findings: Theory is formulated assuming an underlying conformational transmission mechanism, mediated either by horizontal transfer of mammalian genes coding for specific aggregation-prone proteins, or by xeno-templating between bacterial and host proteins. We build a few population-based and experimentally-testable hypotheses focusing on: (1) non-disposable surgical instruments for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and motor neuron disease (MND); and (2) specific bacterial infections such as B. pertussis and E. coli for all forms, but particularly for late-life sporadic conformational, NDDs, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis where natural protein fibrils present in such organisms as a result of adaptation to the human host induce prion-like mechanisms.

The envelope is a lipid bilayer membrane with the virus specific glycoproteins spanning it. The bilayer originates from the host cell membrane and has a lipid composition and transbilayer distribution quite similar to the host\u0027s. The viral glycoproteins have the functions of binding to the target cell surface and fusion with the cell membranes. The two functions are carried by a single glycoprotein in influenza virus (HA), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein, and Semliki Forest virus SFV E glycoprotein. In Sendai virus (HVJ), the functions are carried by separate glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for binding and fusion glycoprotein (F) for fusion. When viruses encounter target cells, they first bind to the cell surface through an interaction of the viral glycoprotein with receptors.","publish_time":"2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohnishi, Shun-Ichi","journal":"Curr Top Membr Transp","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion glycoprotein","lipid bilayer membrane","mechanisms of membrane fusion","target cell membrane lipid bilayer","host cell membrane","influenza virus","Sendai virus","virus specific glycoproteins","target cell surface","low pH-induced membrane fusion","characteristic features of membrane fusion activity","G glycoprotein","single glycoprotein","cell membranes","lipid bilayer hydrophobic core","vesicular stomatitis virus","lipid composition","Semliki Forest virus SFV E glycoprotein","functions of binding","viral glycoproteins","hydrophobic segment","separate glycoproteins","target cells","interaction","VSV","HN","key step","transbilayer distribution","entrance","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","host\u0027s","chapter","HVJ","receptors","envelope","viruses"],"language":"en"},

In 2020, CLEF eHealth is calling for participants to contribute to the following two tasks: The 2020 Task 1 on IE focuses on term coding for clinical textual data in Spanish. The terms considered are extracted from clinical case records and they are mapped onto the Spanish version of the International Classification of Diseases, the 10th Revision, including also textual evidence spans for the clinical codes. The 2020 Task 2 is a novel extension of the most popular and established task in CLEF eHealth on CHS. This IR task uses the representative web corpus used in the 2018 challenge, but now also spoken queries, as well as textual transcripts of these queries, are offered to the participants. The task is structured into a number of optional subtasks, covering ad-hoc search using the spoken queries, textual transcripts of the spoken queries, or provided automatic speech-to-text conversions of the spoken queries. In this paper we describe the evolution of CLEF eHealth and this year\u2019s tasks. The substantial community interest in the tasks and their resources has led to CLEF eHealth maturing as a primary venue for all interdisciplinary actors of the ecosystem for producing, processing, and consuming electronic health information.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suominen, Hanna; Kelly, Liadh; Goeuriot, Lorraine; Krallinger, Martin","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/006c136c2d16211851cb0314e751a2e7e83e23af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Information Extraction","Information Retrieval","CHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spoken queries","motivated CLEF eHealth","CLEF eHealth maturing","evolution of CLEF eHealth","IR task","textual transcripts","established task","clinical textual data","textual evidence","relevant information","Information Extraction","Information Retrieval","year\u2019s tasks","evaluation tasks","consuming electronic health information","clinical codes","participants","clinical case records","processing quality","Spanish version","health-centred decisions","number of optional subtasks","large number of team registrations","submissions","preferred language","primary venue","papers","ad","automatic speech","text conversions","management","term coding","search","representative web corpus","International Classification of Diseases","included authors","interdisciplinary actors","Revision","yearly labs","resources","CHS","novel extension","significant improvements","ecosystem","challenge","difficulties","citations","terms","substantial community","Laypeople\u2019s"],"language":"en"},

The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kowald, Dominik; Schedl, Markus; Lex, Elisabeth","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09a35cfe67538f0177d7f1cd8579bed0653798a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Last.fm"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["popular items","popular music","music domain","context of music recommendation","low-mainstream users","music artists","music platform","medium-mainstream users","high-mainstream users","long-tail items","context of movie recommendations","larger number of available items","state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms","user groups","analyses of Abdollahpouri","worst recommendations","movie domain","dataset","popularity bias leads","low-mainstreaminess group","recent work of Abdollahpouri","different results","accuracy results","proposed Group Average Popularity metric","unfair treatment","recommender systems","listening preferences","Research","paper","line"],"language":"en"},

Besides, non-sensor derived images such as illustrations, data visualizations, figures, etc. are typically used to convey complex information or to explore large datasets. However, this kind of images has received little attention in computer vision. CNNs and similar techniques use large volumes of training data. Currently, many document analysis systems are trained in part on scene images due to the lack of large datasets of educational image data. In this paper, we address this issue and present SlideImages, a dataset for the task of classifying educational illustrations. SlideImages contains training data collected from various sources, e.g., Wikimedia Commons and the AI2D dataset, and test data collected from educational slides. We have reserved all the actual educational images as a test dataset in order to ensure that the approaches using this dataset generalize well to new educational images, and potentially other domains. Furthermore, we present a baseline system using a standard deep neural architecture and discuss dealing with the challenge of limited training data.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morris, David; M\u00FCller-Budack, Eric; Ewerth, Ralph","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4293c11171ab4d2d8aea90b27c897f9838d5b04f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["actual educational images","new educational images","data visualizations","scene images","educational illustrations","large volumes of training data","test dataset","lack of large datasets of educational image data","kind of images","educational slides","challenge of limited training data","AI2D dataset","CNNs","non-sensor derived images","present SlideImages","computer vision tasks","convolutional neural networks","natural scene content","standard deep neural architecture","dealing","impressive results","various sources","similar techniques","Wikimedia Commons","years","little attention","baseline system","past","issue","order","photos","complex information","figures","document analysis systems","approaches","domains","paper"],"language":"en"},

We show that we can cast it as a supervised representation learning problem on graphs, using graph convolutions operating jointly over text and image features, namely cross-modal graph convolutions. The proposed architecture directly learns how to combine image and text features for the ranking task, while taking into account the context given by all the other elements in the set of images to be (re-)ranked. We validate our approach on two datasets: a public dataset from a MediaEval challenge, and a small sample of proprietary image search query logs, referred as WebQ.

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework that directly rewards the framework on these target metrics yielding a better transfer of the target style. We show the improved performance of our proposed framework based on automatic and human evaluation on three independent tasks: wherein we transfer the style of text from formal to informal, high excitement to low excitement, modern English to Shakespearean English, and vice-versa in all the three cases. Improved performance of the proposed framework over existing state-of-the-art frameworks indicates the viability of the approach.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sancheti, Abhilasha; Krishna, Kundan; Srinivasan, Balaji Vasan; Natarajan, Anandhavelu","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5f61790116132de62e1cad3c3fe5f863cb6ff00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["style of text","style transfer models","Style transfer deals","field of text style transfer","better transfer","transfer strength","target style","based framework","proposed framework","piece of text","text generation","improved performance","low excitement","high excitement","Shakespearean English","modern English","Existing works","content preservation","target metrics","core content","existing state-of-the-art frameworks","human evaluation","wide application","algorithms","vice-versa","viability","independent tasks","stylistic properties","reinforcement","cases","approach","lot"],"language":"en"},

It comprises the process of identifying, between different data sources, entity descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity. In this work, we focus on toponym interlinking, that is we handle spatio-textual entities that are exclusively represented by their name; additional properties, such as categories, coordinates, etc. are considered as either absent or of too low quality to be exploited in this setting. Toponyms are inherently heterogeneous entities; quite often several alternative names exist for the same toponym, with varying degrees of similarity between these names. State of the art approaches adopt mostly generic, domain-agnostic similarity functions and use them as is, or incorporate them as training features within classifiers for performing toponym interlinking. We claim that capturing the specificities of toponyms and exploiting them into elaborate meta-similarity functions and derived training features can significantly increase the effectiveness of interlinking methods. To this end, we propose the LGM-Sim meta-similarity function and a series of novel, similarity-based and statistical training features that can be utilized in similarity-based and classification-based interlinking settings respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve large increases in accuracy, in both settings, compared to several methods from the literature in the widely used Geonames toponym dataset.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giannopoulos, Giorgos; Kaffes, Vassilis; Kostoulas, Georgios","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/100527dbd6d17b9cc79e19b0317697603162c972.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["toponym interlinking","interlinking settings","effectiveness of interlinking methods","elaborate meta-similarity functions","varying degrees of similarity","domain-agnostic similarity functions","derived training features","statistical training features","spatio-textual entities","LGM-Sim meta-similarity function","heterogeneous entities","Geonames toponym dataset","proposed methods","entity descriptions","alternative names","real-world entity","specificities of toponyms","series of novel","geomarketing","navigation","application","accuracy","challenging research problem","different data sources","commercial fields","large increases","art approaches","classifiers","categories","social networks","literature","classification","low quality","additional properties","coordinates","State","process","end"],"language":"en"},

However, directly learning a ranker from implicit data is challenging, as users\u2019 implicit feedback usually contains bias (e.g., position bias, selection bias) and noise (e.g., clicking on irrelevant but attractive snippets, adversarial clicks). Two main methods have arisen for optimizing rankers based on implicit feedback: counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR), which learns a ranker from the historical click-through data collected from a deployed, logging ranker; and online learning to rank (OLTR), where a ranker is updated by recording user interaction with a result list produced by multiple rankers (usually via interleaving). In this paper, we propose a counterfactual online learning to rank algorithm (COLTR) that combines the key components of both CLTR and OLTR. It does so by replacing the online evaluation required by traditional OLTR methods with the counterfactual evaluation common in CLTR. Compared to traditional OLTR approaches based on interleaving, COLTR can evaluate a large number of candidate rankers in a more efficient manner. Our empirical results show that COLTR significantly outperforms traditional OLTR methods. Furthermore, COLTR can reach the same effectiveness of the current state-of-the-art, under noisy click settings, and has room for future extensions.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhuang, Shengyao; Zuccon, Guido","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/552978dc8daba8cff72abc5feeb9a41bac9dc4c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLTR","OLTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COLTR","traditional OLTR methods","counterfactual learning","counterfactual online learning","users\u2019 implicit feedback","traditional OLTR approaches","implicit data","CLTR","online evaluation","multiple rankers","logging ranker","counterfactual evaluation common","selection bias","position bias","interleaving","main methods","large number of candidate rankers","historical click","attractive snippets","adversarial clicks","noisy click settings","room","result list","user interaction","noise","key components","algorithm","editorial labelling effort","efficient manner","effectiveness","future extensions","empirical results","benefits","preferences","paper"],"language":"en"},

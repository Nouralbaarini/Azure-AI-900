The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the NASPGHAN program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS 51/77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada and Mexico responded to the survey. 46/51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a \u0022stay-at-home\u0022 order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. 2/51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth prior to COVID-19 and 39/51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22/51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26/51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47/51 (94%) programs, and fellows utilized various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted. CONCLUSIONS This report provides early information of the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric fellowship training. Rapid adoption of telehealth and reduced clinical and research experiences were important changes. Survey information may spur communication and innovation to help educators adapt.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mallon, Daniel; Pohl, John F; Phatak, Uma P; Fernandes, Melissa; Rosen, John M; Lusman, Sarah S; Nylund, Cade M; Jump, Candi S; Solomon, Aliza B; Srinath, Arvind; Singer, Andrew; Harb, Rula; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Buren, Kristin Lynette Whitfield Van; Koyfman, Shifra; Bhatt, Riha; Rodriguez, Dellys M Soler; Sivagnanam, Mamata; Lee, Christine K","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Training Committee"],"locations":["United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["pediatric fellowship training","pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training","Survey information","PDs","question survey","pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors","Clinical research","impact of COVID","Training Committee","New York programs","research experiences","outpatient telehealth","bench research","time","NASPGHAN program director database","early information","important changes","outpatient clinics","reduced fellow staffing","Rapid adoption of telehealth","North American Society","Hepatology","inpatient care","Canada","report","United States","pandemic","healthcare systems","email","Mexico","adult medicine units","weeks","communication","innovation","Nutrition","various online resources","median","CONCLUSIONS","world","patient rooms","Didactics","virtual conferences","order","educators","BACKGROUND","METHODS","descriptive statistics","RESULTS","endoscopy","Responses"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics. METHODS Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated dashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework.We describe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved integration with teleconferencing software into our EHR. To support the rapid preparation for COVID-19 at other health systems, we include samples of the UW Medicine\u0027s COVID-19 order set, COVID-19 documentation template, dashboard metric categories, and a list of the top 10 things your health care IT organization can do now to prepare. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 response requires new and expedited ways of approaching ITS support to clinical needs. UW Medicine ITS leadership hope that by quickly sharing our nimble response to clinical and operational requests, we can help other systems prepare to respond to this public health emergency.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grange, Elisha S; Neil, Eric J; Stoffel, Michelle; Singh, Angad P; Tseng, Ethan; Resco-Summers, Kelly; Fellner, B Jane; Lynch, John B; Mathias, Patrick C; Mauritz-Miller, Kristal; Sutton, Paul R; Leu, Michael G","journal":"Applied clinical informatics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1709715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND UW Medicine","UW Medicine Information Technology Services","UW Medicine","UW"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["new COVID","health systems","health care","UW Medicine\u0027s COVID","clinical response","support","BACKGROUND UW Medicine","public health emergency","integration of new technology","electronic health records","UW Medicine Information Technology Services","nimble response","clinical workflows","clinical needs","equipment","tight integration","improved integration","primary care providers","patients","EHR","recommendations","tele-intensive care","rapid rollout of capabilities","telemedicine capabilities","hospital incident command structure","emergency communication","expedited ways","nonessential staff","rapid preparation","numbers of specialty providers","expedited change control processes","documentation template","order set","ICU","dashboard metric categories","teleconferencing software","automated dashboards","samples","human resources","operational requests","list","security","policies","things","laboratory","United States","leadership hope","transition","organization","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","future pandemics"],"language":"en"},

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation waivers are burdening staff and impacting how care is delivered. Residents are experiencing social isolation that can result in physical and behavioral health issues, particularly for those with dementia. These challenges can be addressed in part through technology adaptations. Full integration of electronic health record systems can improve workflow and care quality. Telehealth can improve access to outside providers, provide remote monitoring, and improve social connectedness. Electronic and audiovisual programs can be used for end-of-life planning and information sharing between nursing home staff and families. Online learning systems and other online resources provide flexible staff education and training options. Investing in and adapting technology can help mitigate workforce stress and improve quality of nursing home care during and after the COVID-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edelman, Linda S; McConnell, Eleanor S; Kennerly, Susan M; Alderden, Jenny; Horn, Susan D; Yap, Tracey L","journal":"JMIR aging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/20110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nursing home staff","quality of nursing home care","burdening staff","care quality","flexible staff education","COVID","residents","Online learning systems","integration of electronic health record systems","online resources","social connectedness","social isolation","adapting technology","technology adaptations","behavioral health issues","CMS","Medicaid Services","regulation waivers","workflow","remote monitoring","workforce stress","outside providers","information","NH","training options","life planning","end","access","Medicare","pandemic","Telehealth","Centers","audiovisual programs","families"],"language":"en"},

With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control. Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 102 RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR. Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30 min combined with the colorimetric visualization. This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV). Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baek, Yun Hee; Um, Jihye; Antigua, Khristine Joy C; Park, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Yeonjae; Oh, Sol; Kim, Young-Il; Choi, Won-Suk; Kim, Seong Gyu; Jeong, Ju Hwan; Chin, Bum Sik; Nicolas, Halcyon Dawn G; Ahn, Ji-Young; Shin, Kyeong Seob; Choi, Young Ki; Park, Jun-Sun; Song, Min-Suk","journal":"Emerging microbes \u0026 infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1756698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","novel SARS-CoV","developed RT-LAMP assay","preliminary detection of SARS","specific detection of SARS","detection limit","rapid detection span","previous outbreaks of SARS","isothermal amplification","disease control","single-tube colorimetric detection method","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-NL63","qRT-PCR","high sensitivity","high agreement","viral RNAs","availability of rapid","suspected patients","colorimetric visualization","respiratory disease-causing viruses","RNA copies close","human infectious influenza viruses","type B","RSVB","H1N1pdm","reliable diagnostic methods","H3N2","RSVA","PIV","H5N6","H5N1","ADV","areas","public health responses","specificity","reverse transcription loop","MPV","H7N9","H5N8","researchers","clinical laboratories","specimens","nucleocapsid gene","recent emergence","impediment","role of diagnostics","limited laboratory capacities","addition","coronaviruses","COVID","primer","cross-reactivity","time-efficient","HRV","test","transmission"],"language":"en"},

In the presence of a uterus it is possible for the patient to have subtotal hysterectomy and cervicopexy, total hysterectomy with colpopexy or uterine conservation and hysteropexy. However, hysteropexy seems to be associated with a higher risk of anterior compartment failure compared with cervicopexy or colpopexy. It is not uncommon for an asymmetrically large anterior compartment defect to co-exist with a symptomatic apical pelvic organ prolapse. In a cervicopexy or colpopexy, this asymmetry can be balanced by creating a de novo vaginal apex from the superior part of the anterior vaginal wall. However in a hysteropexy the attachment of the base of the anterior mesh to the vagina and cervical isthmus limits the ability to do this. METHODS In this video we present a solution where the shape of the posterior mesh is modified to include two horizontal arms that are passed through openings in the broad ligament and attached to the cervical isthmus anteriorly. RESULTS This frees the anterior Y-shaped mesh to be fixed to the anterior vaginal wall only and hence provides the required tension to create the de novo apex. CONCLUSION Prior to wide adoption, this technique should be further investigated in the context of robustly designed comparative studies.","publish_time":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalis, Vladimir; Rusavy, Zdenek; Ismail, Khaled M","journal":"International urogynecology journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-019-04150-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31802161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anterior mesh","anterior vaginal wall","cervicopexy","hysteropexy","anterior Y-shaped mesh","large anterior compartment defect","novo vaginal apex","higher risk of anterior compartment failure","posterior mesh","cervical isthmus","novo apex","symptomatic apical pelvic organ","significant apical pelvic organ","subtotal hysterectomy","surgical management","preferred contemporary procedure","HYPOTHESIS Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy","patient","uterine conservation","openings","base","broad ligament","solution","CONCLUSION","wide adoption","technique","uterus","INTRODUCTION","required tension","ability","attachment","horizontal arms","context","comparative studies","video","presence","RESULTS","asymmetry","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Most traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have some degree of DAI, especially severe TBI. Computed tomography (CT) remains the first imaging test performed in the acute phase of TBI, but has low sensitivity for detecting DAI, since DAI is a cellular lesion. The aim of this study is to search in the literature for CT signs, in the first 24 h after TBI, that may help to differentiate patients in groups with a better versus worst prognosis. METHODS We searched for primary scientific articles in the PubMed database, in English, indexed since January 1st, 2000. RESULTS Five articles were selected for review. In the DAI group, traffic accidents accounted 70% of the cases, 79% were male, and the mean age was 41 years. There was an association between DAI and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH); an association between the IVH grade and number of corpus callosum lesions; and an association between blood in the interpeduncular cisterns (IPC) and brainstem lesions. CONCLUSION In closed TBI with no tSAH, severe DAI is unlikely. Similarly, in the absence of IVH, any DAI is unlikely. If there is IVH, patients generally are clinically worse; and the more ventricles affected, the worse the prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Figueira Rodrigues Vieira, Giovana; Guedes Correa, Jos\u00E9 Fernando","journal":"Neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02383-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32130462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAI","TBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe DAI","degree of DAI","DAI group","closed TBI","severe TBI","association","IVH grade","absence of IVH","acute phase of TBI","tSAH","patients","traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage","closed head injury","intraventricular hemorrhage","brainstem lesions","CT signs","worst prognosis","primary scientific articles","traumatic brain injuries","number of corpus callosum lesions","PURPOSE Diffuse axonal injury","deceleration forces","acceleration","interpeduncular cisterns","PubMed database","IPC","rupture of multiple axons","blood","imaging test","groups","low sensitivity","traffic accidents","mean age","male","literature","METHODS","ventricles","CONCLUSION","cellular lesion","study","years","cases","English","Computed tomography","RESULTS","review","aim"],"language":"en"},

Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants) coveralls were more difficult to doff than isolation gowns (very low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). According to three studies that tested more recently introduced full-body PPE ensembles, there may be no difference in contamination. Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Sauni, Riitta; Toomey, Elaine; Blackwood, Bronagh; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HCW","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doffing PPE","types of PPE","standard PPE","PPE design","PPE protocols","type of PPE","Modified PPE","adapted PPE","body PPE ensembles","risk of contamination","simulation studies","controlled studies","RR","selected studies","risk of bias","risk ratio","greater risk of infection","low-certainty evidence","MD","median contamination rates","doffing processes","better fitting gown","doffing of masks","types of training","low certainty","exposed body parts","sealed gown","training methods","effects of training","method of donning","better cover","gown-wrist interface","infectious diseases","effect of various ways of donning","patients\u0027 contaminated body fluids","quasi-RCT","controlled trials","outcomes","participants","non-randomised design","review authors","DATA COLLECTION","mean difference","water-repellent material","SEARCH METHODS","breathable material","isolation gowns","best way","greater user satisfaction","random-effects meta-analyses","glove combination","SARS","following modifications","Ebola","contact","fluorescent markers","ANALYSIS","small patches","neck","severe acute respiratory syndrome","simulated exposure","N95 mask","MEDLINE","aprons","trunk","wrists","harmless microbes","general population","similar number of spots","COVID","air","MAIN RESULTS Earlier versions","hands","indirectness","confidence interval","Embase","CINAHL","coronavirus","healthcare workers","BACKGROUND","epidemics","Personal protective equipment","coveralls","SELECTION CRITERIA","noncompliance","tabs","non-compliance","gloves","intervention","control groups","OBJECTIVES","update","HCWs","scale","bacterial contamination","doffing procedures","fluorescent contamination","similar contamination","CDC doffing guidance","donning PPE","fewer contamination spots","PPE use","use of PPE","combinations of PPE","fewer errors","Face-to-face training","breathable types of PPE","gown removal","Double-gloving","difficult donning","RCTs of training","One-step removal of gloves","folder-based training","use of additional computer simulation","one-step glove","single gloving","simulation of exposure","Face-to-face instruction","Additional spoken instruction","separate removal","HCW","glove disinfection","better protection","user comfort","video lecture","real-life evidence","traditional lecture","risk of infection","better skills scores","Extra sanitation of gloves","alcohol-based hand rub","Prevention","Disease Control","Centers","quaternary ammonium","odds ratio","parts","recommendations","instructions","assessment of outcome","body","Consensus","long-term follow-up","cost","bleach","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","Modifications","folders","videos"],"language":"en"},

This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rothlin, Rodolfo Pedro; Vetulli, H\u00E9ctor Miguel; Duarte, Mariano; Pelorosso, Facundo Germ\u00E1n","journal":"Drug development research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","SARS coronavirus","membrane protein ACE2","S protein-ACE2 complex","alveolar cells","evaluation of telmisartan","election of telmisartan","patients","new coronavirus","causative virus SARS-CoV","tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin","enzymatic function ACE2","physiological antagonist angiotensin","High levels of angiotensin","inflammatory process","lung interstitium","alternative options","new disease","development of ARDS","lung complications similar","clinical trial","release of proinflammatory cytokines","total loss","China","losartan","open-label randomized phase","Wuhan Province","apoptosis","basis","turn","type","surface","pharmacodynamic properties","partial decrease","tentative use of agents","self-powered cascade","authors","case","endocytosis","Gurwitz","binds","airway","degradation","commentary article","NCT04355936","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study with a difference-in-differences design compared daily changes in COVID-19 cases per 10 000 residents in 8 Iowa counties bordering Illinois with those in the 7 Illinois counties bordering Iowa before and after Illinois issued a stay-at-home order on March 21, 2020. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for differences in timing of closing schools and nonessential businesses between the 2 states and differential trends in COVID-19 cases by county population density and poverty rates. Exposures Issuing a stay-at-home order. Main Outcomes and Measures Comparison of cumulative cases of COVID-19 per 10 000 residents in border counties in Iowa and Illinois. Results The total populations were 462 445 in the Iowa border counties and 272 385 in the Illinois border counties. Population density was higher in the Iowa counties (114.2 people per square mile) than in the Illinois counties (78.2 people per square mile). Trends of cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10 000 residents for the Iowa and Illinois border counties were comparable before the Illinois stay-at-home order, which went into effect at 5:00 pm on March 21 (March 15 to March 21: 0.024 per 10 000 residents vs 0.026 per 10 000 residents). After that, cases increased more quickly in Iowa and more slowly in Illinois. Within 10, 20, and 30 days after the enactment of the stay-at-home order in Illinois, the difference in cases was -0.51 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.32; P \u003C .001), -1.15 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.49; 95% CI, -2.12 to -0.18; P = .02), and -4.71 per 10 000 residents (SE, 1.99; 95% CI, -8.64 to -0.78; P = .02), respectively. The estimates indicate excess cases in the border Iowa counties by as many as 217 cases after 1 month without a stay-at-home order. This estimate of excess cases represents 30.4% of the 716 total cases in those Iowa counties by that date. Sensitivity analyses addressing differences in timing of closing schools and nonessential businesses and differences in county population density and poverty rates between the 2 states supported these findings. Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study with a difference-in-differences design found an increase in estimated rates of COVID-19 cases per 10 000 residents in the border counties in Iowa compared with the border counties in Illinois following a stay-at-home order that was implemented in Illinois but not in Iowa.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyu, Wei; Wehby, George L","journal":"JAMA network open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.11102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Illinois","Iowa"],"keyphrases":["Illinois counties","Iowa border counties","border Iowa counties","Illinois border counties","Illinois stay-at-home order","total cases","Importance Iowa","estimate of excess cases","Measures Comparison of cumulative cases of COVID","residents vs","differences design","estimated rates of COVID","Trends of cumulative COVID","reduced rate of COVID","states","county population density","poverty rates","nonessential businesses","timing of closing schools","cross-sectional study","square mile","people","Additional sensitivity analyses","differential trends","total populations","account","Participants","increase","daily changes","Main Outcomes","infections","Relevance","Setting","coronavirus disease","enactment","Conclusions","effect","estimates","month","empirical evidence","days","Exposures","Objective","date","findings","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample \u0394CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4\u002B T lymphocyte, and CD8\u002B T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p \u003C 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and \u003C0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p \u003C 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4\u002B T lymphocyte count, and CD8\u002B T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p \u003C 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p \u003C 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p \u003C 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yang; Liao, Wenjian; Wan, Lagen; Xiang, Tianxing; Zhang, Wei","journal":"Viral immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2020.0062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T lymphocyte count","severe group","lymphocyte count disease severity","relative RNA load","mild group","lymphocyte subset counts","relative SARS-CoV","relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV","nasopharyngeal viral load of patients","prothrombin time","hypersensitive troponin T","severe disease symptoms","CD8","CD4","fibrinogen levels","lactate dehydrogenase","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","nucleic acid test","correlation","COVID","coagulation system factor levels","new coronavirus","significant differences","myocardial injury indexes","throat swab sample \u0394CT values","D-dimer","pneumonia","laboratory biochemical indicators","organ damage","dynamic changes","Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University","interleukin","nasopharynx","conclusion","study","groups","aim","female","Cases","addition"],"language":"en"},

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 2019 to 24 February 2020. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results. A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients). The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; n = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; n = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; n = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; n = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, n = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, n = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, n = 1744).

Elevated D-dimer levels which correlated inversely with overall survival were recently reported in Chinese cohort studies. Critically however, ethnicity has major effects on thrombotic risk, with a 3-4 fold lower risk in Chinese compared to Caucasians and a significantly higher risk in African-Americans. In this study, we investigated COVID-19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients. Our findings confirm that severe COVID-19 infection is associated with a significant coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity. Importantly however, Caucasian COVID-19 patients on LMWH thrombo-prophylaxis rarely develop overt DIC. In rare COVID-19 cases where DIC does develop, it tends to be restricted to late stage disease. Collectively, these data suggest that the diffuse bilateral pulmonary inflammation observed in COVID-19 is associated with a novel pulmonary-specific vasculopathy which we have termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) as distinct to DIC. Given that thrombotic risk is significantly impacted by race, coupled with the accumulating evidence that coagulopathy is important in COVID-19 pathogenesis, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulmonary vasculopathy may contribute to the unexplained differences that are beginning to emerge highlighting racial susceptibility to COVID-19 mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fogarty, Helen; Townsend, Liam; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Browne, Paul; Bacon, Christopher L; Gaule, Richard; Gillett, Alexander; Byrne, Mary; Ryan, Kevin; O\u0027Connell, Niamh; O\u0027Sullivan, Jamie M; Conlan, Niall; O\u0027 Donnell, James S","journal":"British journal of haematology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMWH","DIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Caucasian COVID","severe COVID","rare COVID","pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy","pulmonary vasculopathy","significant coagulopathy","thrombotic risk","higher risk","lung-centric coagulopathy","novel pulmonary-specific vasculopathy","fold lower risk","findings","Caucasian patients","overt DIC","accumulating data","diffuse bilateral pulmonary inflammation","accumulating evidence","important role","disease severity","Chinese cohort studies","late stage disease","LMWH thrombo-prophylaxis","Caucasians","PIC","intriguing possibility","overall survival","highlighting racial susceptibility","ethnicity","major effects","race","pathogenesis","Elevated D-dimer levels","infection","African-Americans","unexplained differences","mortality","cases","pathophysiology","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We acquired information and data on the general information, infection and death status of health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS We have obtained the data on 2,457 infected cases among health care workers in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), while 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among health care workers were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected health care workers (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of health care workers (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-health care workers (0.43%). The case fatality rate of health care workers (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-health care workers (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies and improve protective measures for HCWs.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Lichun; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Chongchong; Liu, Qin; Li, Shuang; Sun, Qin; Wang, Mengjia; Zhou, Qian; Wang, Wenmei","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["infected health care workers","non-health care workers","BACKGROUND Health care workers","case infection rate of health care workers","death status of health care workers","case fatality rate of health care workers","infected cases","infection status of HCWs","infection risk of HCWs","non-HCWs","case infection rate of nurses","substantial risk of infection","infected individuals","general hospitals","Wuhan","general information","COVID","data","specialized hospitals","outbreak","community hospitals","doctors","essential role","government agencies","frontline","effective suggestions","protective measures","coronavirus disease","public","attention","China","female","majority","half","CONCLUSIONS","analysis","statistical analyses","pandemic","medical staff","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Syndrome-specific, diagnostic panels have potential to provide information about aetiology quickly. Available panels have been of limited use in lower respiratory tract infections due to slow turn-around-time, lack of quantification of important pathogens and lack of detection of resistance genes.Materials/methods: We evaluated the newly developed Biofire\u00AE Filmarray\u00AE Pneumonia Panel plus (Biom\u00E9rieux). Eighty-eight consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were analyzed by both standard microbiological methods, as requested by the referring clinician, and by the panel. The agreement with standard methods, empirical treatment coverage and possible impact on isolation practices were assessed by comparing the results from standard diagnostic methods with the panel results in relation to clinical data and information of antimicrobial therapy.Results: Both qualitative and semi-quantitative results from the panel generally displayed good agreement with standard methods and by combining methods, a possible aetiology was detected in 73% of patients. Due to the panel approach, the panel detected viruses more frequently. In 25% of the 60 patients assessed for empirical treatment coverage, a pathogen not covered by current therapy was detected and in 30% of in-house patients the panel results were found to potentially influence clinical decisions related to isolation care.Conclusions: The new diagnostic panel shows promise in improving aetiological diagnostics of lower respiratory tract infections. Correctly applied it has potential to offer support in clinical decision-making within hours of sampling.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edin, Alicia; Eilers, Hinnerk; Allard, Annika","journal":"Infectious diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2020.1755053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["panel results","standard methods","Standard diagnostic methods","Pneumonia Panel","panel approach","new diagnostic panel","standard microbiological methods","diagnostic panels","clinical decisions","aetiological diagnostics of lower respiratory tract infections","consecutive lower respiratory tract samples","clinical data","clinical decision-making","empirical treatment coverage","semi-quantitative results","isolation care","isolation practices","potential","possible aetiology","in-house patients","information of antimicrobial therapy","lack of detection","slow turn","lack of quantification","possible impact","good agreement","Available panels","current therapy","limited use","important pathogens","promise","Conclusions","relation","resistance genes","time","Filmarray","developed Biofire","Materials","support","Background","hours of sampling","Syndrome-specific","Biom\u00E9rieux","viruses","referring clinician"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to test the safety and feasibility of 5% CO2 and 95% air inhalation to correct hypocapnia in mechanically ventilated infants with NE undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS Ten infants were assigned to this open-label, single-center trial. The gas mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% air was administered through patient circuits if the temperature-corrected PCO2 \u226440 mm Hg. The CO2 inhalation was continued for 12 h or was stopped earlier if the base deficit (BD) level decreased \u003C5 mmol/L. Follow-up was performed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. RESULTS The patients spent a median 95.1% (range 44.6-98.5%) of time in the desired PCO2 range (40-60 mm Hg) during the inhalation. All PCO2 values were \u003E40 mm Hg, the lower value of the target range. Regression modeling revealed that BD and lactate had a tendency to decrease during the intervention (by 0.61 and 0.55 mmol/L/h, respectively), whereas pH remained stable. The rate of moderate disabilities and normal outcome was 50%. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that inhaled 5% CO2 administration is a feasible and safe intervention for correcting hypocapnia.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szakmar, Eniko; Kovacs, Kata; Meder, Unoke; Bokodi, Geza; Andorka, Csilla; Lakatos, Andrea; Szabo, Attila J; Belteki, Gusztav; Szabo, Miklos; Jermendy, Agnes","journal":"Pediatric research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0697-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31785594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bayley Scales of Infant Development II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CO2 inhalation","Hg","CO2 administration","air inhalation","desired PCO2 range","ventilated infants","correct hypocapnia","correcting hypocapnia","BD","target range","PCO2 values","mmol","results","temperature-corrected PCO2","normal outcome","safe intervention","adverse neurodevelopmental outcome","neonatal encephalopathy","association","patient circuits","open-label","lactate","rate of moderate disabilities","level","therapeutic hypothermia","lower value","single-center trial","Bayley Scales of Infant Development","Follow-up","Regression modeling","base deficit","safety","tendency","time","BACKGROUND","gas mixture","feasibility","patients","aim","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

It has been described that volatile OSCs uptake occurs into a moderate extent. Among the bioavailable OSCs present in garlic, 2-vinyl-4H-1,3-dithiin (2VD) is a main component in garlic macerated oil and stir-fried garlic but has been poorly investigated compared with others OSCs, such allyl mercaptan (AM) and S-allyl cysteine (SAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2VD on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and compare them with those produced by AM and SAC. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using tetrazolium dye MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated by scrape-wound migration assay. OSCs anti-oxidative capacity was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and total antioxidant status (TAS). Non-toxic plasmatic concentrations (10 \u03BCg L-1) of 2VD and AM inhibited VSMCs proliferation stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum and impaired cell migration. In further flow cytometry analysis 2VD treatment resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. The OSCs tested were able to prevent ROS increase after angiotensin II stimulation and surprisingly 2VD induced higher total antioxidant status compared with AM and SAC. Our results showed that 2VD produces equivalent or superior beneficial effects on VSMCs to those reported for other bioavailable compounds of garlic. This preliminary evidence suggests that 2VD intake could also exert important protective effects against arterial remodeling in hypertension.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres-Palazzolo, Carolina; de Paola, Matilde; Quesada, Isabel; Camargo, Alejandra; Castro, Claudia","journal":"Plant foods for human nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-020-00819-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAC","ROS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VD treatment","VD intake","stir-fried garlic","bioavailable compounds of garlic","bioavailable OSCs present","SAC","impaired cell migration","volatile OSCs uptake","Cell viability","OSCs anti-oxidative capacity","inhibited VSMCs proliferation","partial cell cycle arrest","higher total antioxidant status","scrape-wound migration assay","important protective effects","superior beneficial effects","anti-hypertensive effect","flow cytometry analysis","ROS increase","allyl mercaptan","Organosulfur compounds","spontaneous hypertensive rats","S-allyl cysteine","tetrazolium dye MTT assay","generation","various health benefits","fetal bovine serum","vascular smooth muscle cells","reactive oxygen species","arterial remodeling","G2 phase","angiotensin","stimulation","oil","main component","hypertension","moderate extent","Non-toxic plasmatic concentrations","\u03BCg","SHR","vinyl","preliminary evidence","TAS","study","dithiin","results","aim"],"language":"en"},

Most hospital falls prevention strategies have targeted clinician education, environmental modifications, assistive devices, hospital systems and medication reviews. The role that patients can play in preventing falls whilst in hospital has received less attention. This critical review scopes patient falls education interventions for hospitals. The quality of the educational designs under-pinning patient falls education programmes was also evaluated. The outcomes of patient-centred falls prevention programs were considered for a range of hospital settings and diagnoses. METHODS The Arksey and O\u0027Malley (2005) framework for scoping reviews was adapted using Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases, including grey literature, were searched from January 2008 until February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and data were extracted and summarised thematically. The quality of falls prevention education programs for patients was also appraised using a modified quality metric tool. RESULTS Forty-three articles were included in the final analysis. The interventions included: (i) direct face-to-face patient education about falls risks and mitigation; (ii) educational tools; (iii) patient-focussed consumer materials such as pamphlets, brochures and handouts; and (iv) hospital systems, policies and procedures to assist patients to prevent falls. The included studies assessed falls or education related outcomes before and after patient falls prevention education. Few studies reported incorporating education design principles or educational theories. When reported, most educational programs were of low to moderate quality from an educational design perspective. CONCLUSIONS There is emerging evidence that hospital falls prevention interventions that incorporate patient education can reduce falls and associated injuries such as bruising, lacerations or fractures. The design, mode of delivery and quality of educational design influence outcomes. Well-designed education programs can improve knowledge and self-perception of risk, empowering patients to reduce their risk of falling whilst in hospital.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heng, Hazel; Jazayeri, Dana; Shaw, Louise; Kiegaldie, Debra; Hill, Anne-Marie; Morris, Meg E","journal":"BMC geriatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01515-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Joanna Briggs Institute"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of falls prevention education programs","education interventions","centred falls prevention programs","clinician education","education programmes","outcomes of patient","Well-designed education programs","educational programs","hospital systems","direct face-to-face patient education","education related outcomes","BACKGROUND Hospital","incorporating education design principles","prevention interventions","quality of educational design influence outcomes","educational design perspective","educational theories","educational tools","range of hospital settings","educational designs under-pinning patient","moderate quality","prevention strategies","critical review scopes patient","patient-focussed consumer materials","empowering patients","included studies","modified quality metric tool","articles","scoping reviews","medication reviews","self-perception of risk","assistive devices","environmental modifications","Joanna Briggs Institute","knowledge","pamphlets","risks","emerging evidence","mode of delivery","PRISMA-ScR guidelines","mitigation","procedures","associated injuries","O\u0027Malley","brochures","framework","policies","hospitals","Arksey","lacerations","handouts","diagnoses","CONCLUSIONS","debilitating problem","databases","grey literature","METHODS","reviewers","final analysis","fractures","RESULTS","role","attention"],"language":"en"},

Numerous hospital-based investigations have revealed the RSV prevalence between 0.2-54% in the paediatric population with ARI/ALRI from Saudi Arabia during 1991-2015. Maximum RSV infections occurred in children less than 1 year of age (51-97%) and male children (51-69%) were more commonly affected than females (31-49%). RSV infections are reported mostly during winter season suggesting seasonal distribution of the virus. Other respiratory viruses reported from this region are adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus including many mixed infections. A few studies have reported the phylogenetic analysis of the circulating strains of RSV. These studies have revealed that circulating group A-RSV Saudi strains belonged to NA1 and ON1 genotypes and group B-RSV viruses clustered in the BA genotype. Molecular characterization of the Saudi strains was further carried out by mutational, selection pressure and glycosylation site analyses. We have compiled all the eighteen studies of RSV infection from Saudi Arabia in the form of this review and concluded that detailed comprehensive surveillance of RSV and other viruses in community and hospital settings is required. Information on the molecular characterization of currently circulating strains of RSV will contribute towards better understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of this viral pathogen. Moreover, the determination of the genetic composition of circulating RSV strains will be important during evaluation of initial vaccine trials.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar; Parveen, Shama; Al-Hassinah, Sarah M; Al-Amery, Salman F","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32012121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["RSV Saudi strains","circulating strains of RSV","RSV prevalence","studies of RSV infection","Maximum RSV infections","genetic composition of circulating RSV strains","group B-RSV viruses","Saudi Arabia","detailed comprehensive surveillance of RSV","respiratory viruses","ARI","Respiratory syncytial virus","mixed infections","Molecular characterization","major pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection","viral pathogen","hospital settings","male children","Numerous hospital-based investigations","ON1 genotypes","NA1","parainfluenza","human metapneumovirus","different geographical regions","evolutionary dynamics","selection pressure","epidemiology","rhinovirus","review","adenovirus","winter season","better understanding","ALRI","glycosylation site analyses","evaluation of initial vaccine trials","phylogenetic analysis","seasonal distribution","community","paediatric population","determination","BA genotype","year of age","Information","females"],"language":"en"},

The current treatments for HCC suffer from drug resistance and poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Phytochemicals have been proposed to treat a range of cancers. Among them, \u03B1-lipoic acid (\u03B1-LA), a naturally synthesized antioxidant found in various dietary animal and plant sources, prevents oxidant-mediated cell death in normal cells while inducing apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Previously, we demonstrated that the treatment of hepatoma cells with \u03B1-LA induced apoptosis, which was preceded by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the p53 protein, a known inducer of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Several studies have shown that ROS-induced apoptosis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) activation. Herein, we investigated if \u03B1-LA-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines was ER stress- and UPR-mediated by gene expression profiling analyses. UPR and ER stress pathways were the most up-regulated after treatment with \u03B1-LA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study between January 2005 and April 2017, in which the treatment outcomes of all patients who received either percutaneous TEA or RFA for HCC tumors of size \u2264 3 cm, of Child-Pugh grade A or B, received no prior treatment other than surgical resection, were compared. For TEA, a mixture of absolute ethanol and ethiodized oil at a proportion of 1:2 by volume was administered superselectively into the tumor via a microcatheter placed at the feeding arteries. The TEA group and the RFA group consisted of 68 consecutive patients (88 treated target tumors) and 129 consecutive patients (129 tumors), respectively. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all the target tumors in both groups. Grade 3 complication (CIRSE Classification) of prolonged fever occurred in 3 cases with multi-focal and large tumors in the TEA group. There was no statistically significant difference in complete response rate between the TEA group (84/88 or 95.5%) and the RFA group (188/195 or 96.4%) (p = 0.7). Time to progression in the TEA group [median 11.9 months, interquartile range (IQR) 5.6-18 months] was not statistically different from that in the RFA group (median 9.5 months, IQR 3.5-18.7 months) (p = 0.773).

APPROACH A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting against COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cellphone. The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injuries types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures. Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were employed to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. RESULTS A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid. The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% CI 41.30%-44.30%) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist associated skin damage and skin tear. Co-skin injuries and multiple locations injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95%CI for OR 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13) and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries. Only 17.7% respondents took prevention and 45.0% skin injuries were treated. INNOVATION This the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. CONCLUSION The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment. A comprehensive program should be taken in future.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Qixia; Song, Siping; Zhou, Jihong; Liu, Yuxiu; Chen, Aihua; Bai, Yuxuan; Wang, Jing; Jiang, Zhixia; Zhang, Yanhong; Liu, Haiying; Hua, Jiao; Guo, Jinli; Han, Qiuying; Tang, Yongli; Xue, Jiayu","journal":"Advances in wound care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/wound.2020.1212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320359/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skin injuries types","Co-skin injuries","preventive status of skin injuries","overall prevalence of skin injuries","skin tear","related pressure injuries","multiple locations injuries","moist associated skin damage","medical staff","grade of PPE","respondents","daily wearing time","logistic regression analyses","cross-sectional survey","OR1","logistic regression analysis","types of device","Univariable analyses","preventive measures","insufficient prevention","questionnaire items","anatomical sites","personal protective equipment","characteristics","demographic data","sweating","CONCLUSION","risk factors","treatment","hospitals","COVID","comprehensive program","future","OBJECTIVE","INNOVATION","Participants","cellphone","total","male","benchmark"],"language":"en"},

A remaining unanswered question is whether elevated amygdala activity in those with familial risk for depression is related to the presence of subthreshold symptoms or to a trait-level vulnerability for illness. METHODS To examine this question, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected in nondepressed young adults with (family history [FH\u002B]) (n = 27) or without (FH-) (n = 45) a first-degree relative with a history of depression while they viewed images of \u0022looming\u0022 or withdrawing stimuli (faces and cars) that varied in salience by virtue of their apparent proximity to the subject. Activation of the amygdala and 2 other regions known to exhibit responses to looming stimuli, the dorsal intraparietal sulcus (DIPS) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv), were measured, as well as levels of resilience, anxiety, and psychotic and depressive symptoms. RESULTS Compared with the FH- group, the FH\u002B group exhibited significantly greater responses of the amygdala, but not the dorsal intraparietal sulcus or ventral premotor cortex, to looming face stimuli. Moreover, amygdala responses in the FH\u002B group were negatively correlated with levels of resilience and unrelated to levels of subthreshold symptoms of psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that elevated amygdala activity in nondepressed young adults with a familial history of depression is more closely linked to poor resilience than to current symptom state.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barbour, Tracy; Holmes, Avram J; Farabaugh, Amy H; DeCross, Stephanie N; Coombs, Garth; Boeke, Emily A; Wolthusen, Rick P F; Nyer, Maren; Pedrelli, Paola; Fava, Maurizio; Holt, Daphne J","journal":"Biological psychiatry.

The variability for where and what \u0022home-based\u0022 exercise can represent challenges interpretation of findings and appropriate advocacy, referral, or development of these models of care. Therefore, the objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive summary of how home-based exercise is defined and reported in the literature and summarize the range of supportive elements utilized in home-based exercise trials. METHODS We followed methodology for scoping reviews. Relevant research databases were searched from inception to March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened articles to determine eligibility and extracted terminology used to describe home-based exercise and intervention details for intervention delivery. RESULTS Of the 9432 records identified, 229 articles met inclusion criteria. Across the literature, exercise interventions were described as home-based if they were completed at-home, outdoors in the neighbourhood, and in community facilities; or in self-selected environments; or if they were unsupervised. Supportive elements for home-based models ranged with respect to the amount of supervision and resources utilized, including the provision of print materials, exercise equipment, telephone support, home visits, and technology. CONCLUSIONS This review provides a comprehensive summary of strategies previously utilized to deliver home-based exercise interventions in oncology, along with the various definitions of the home-based environment for exercise reported by researchers. Specific recommendations to improve the prescription and reporting of home-based exercise interventions are provided in order to facilitate the delivery, evaluation, and translation of findings into clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopez, Christian; McGarragle, Kaitlin; Pritlove, Cheryl; Jones, Jennifer M; Alibhai, Shabbir M H; Lenton, Erica; Santa Mina, Daniel","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05453-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["home-based exercise trials","reporting of home-based exercise interventions","home-based models","exercise equipment","home-based environment","literature","intervention delivery","range of supportive elements","comprehensive summary of strategies","translation of findings","intervention details","home visits","screened articles","models of care","challenges interpretation of findings","telephone support","appropriate advocacy","prescription","provision of print materials","considerable heterogeneity","development","referral","oncology","order","various definitions","community facilities","eligibility","evaluation","respect","terminology","self-selected environments","METHODS","methodology","scoping reviews","Relevant research databases","inception","records","reviewers","neighbourhood","clinical practice","technology","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","researchers","Specific recommendations","inclusion criteria","supervision","resources","RESULTS","objective","variability"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island. PARTICIPANTS 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality. RESULTS Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of \u003E2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI \u003E40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI \u003E40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of \u003C88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level \u003E1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level \u003E200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level \u003E2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. CONCLUSIONS Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrilli, Christopher M; Jones, Simon A; Yang, Jie; Rajagopalan, Harish; O\u0027Donnell, Luke; Chernyak, Yelena; Tobin, Katie A; Cerfolio, Robert J; Francois, Fritz; Horwitz, Leora I","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444366/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Long Island"],"keyphrases":["Risk of critical illness","hospice care","severity of illness","mortality","lesser extent of critical illness","outcomes of people","intensive care","strong predictors of hospital admission","CONCLUSIONS Age","BMI","Admission oxygen saturation","age groups older","laboratory characteristics","adverse outcomes","laboratory results","risk factors","discharge","mechanical ventilation","coronavirus disease","covid","death","SARS-Cov","patients","comorbidities","strongest risks","years","heart failure","troponin level","male sex","competing risk survival analysis","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes","D-dimer level","medical history","patient characteristics","impairment of oxygen","study period","C reactive protein level","chronic kidney disease","Single academic medical center","DESIGN Prospective cohort study","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","New York City","vital signs","Long Island","body mass index","increase","markers of inflammation","Multivariable logistic regression","United States","ages","PARTICIPANTS","time","odds ratio","confidence interval","Similar associations","infection","improvements","OBJECTIVE","final date","exclusions"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND PAOS is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder affecting programming and planning of speech. Patients with PAOS predictably develop Parkinsonism. DAT scan is a neuroimaging tool that assesses the integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters in striatum and is usually abnormal in PSP and CBS. METHODS As part of an NIH-funded grant, we performed a DAT scan on 17 PAOS patients early in the disease course. DaTQUANT software was used to quantify uptake in the left and right caudate and anterior/posterior putamen, with striatum to background ratios (SBRs). The PAOS cohort was compared to 15 PSP and 8 CBS patients. RESULTS Five PAOS patients (29%) showed abnormalities in at least one striatal region on DAT scan. When the five PAOS patients with abnormal DAT were compared to the PSP and CBS patients, the only difference observed was lower uptake in the posterior putamen in PSP (p = 0.03). There were no differences is putamen/caudate ratio or in symmetry of uptake, across all groups. There was also no difference in MDS-UPDRS-III scores between PAOS patients with and without abnormal DAT scans (p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS Abnormal DAT scan is observed early in the disease course in approximately 30% of PAOS patients, with striatal abnormalities similar to those in PSP and CBS.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seckin, Zeynep Idil; Whitwell, Jennifer L; Utianski, Rene L; Botha, Hugo; Ali, Farwa; Duffy, Joseph R; Clark, Heather M; Machulda, Mary M; Jordan, Lennon G; Min, Hoon-Ki; Lowe, Val J; Josephs, Keith A","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09883-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBS","PAOS","PSP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PAOS patients","CBS patients","PSP","BACKGROUND PAOS","PAOS cohort","CONCLUSIONS Abnormal DAT scan","abnormal DAT scans","progressive apraxia of speech","planning of speech","posterior putamen","striatum","motor speech disorder","symmetry of uptake","lower uptake","disease course","striatal abnormalities similar","SPECT findings","caudate ratio","corticobasal syndrome","neurodegenerative syndrome","striatal region","background ratios","progressive supranuclear palsy","integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters","programming","neuroimaging tool","FP-CIT","MDS-UPDRS","scores","NIH-funded grant","SBRs","differences","DaTQUANT software","groups","Parkinsonism","RESULTS","METHODS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Here, VAL was designed to be conjugated with bovine serum protein to prepare immunogen. A highly sensitive monoclonal antibody that recognized both VAL and TIA has been successfully produced. Moreover, an immunochromatographic strip assay for rapidly screening VAL and TIA in porcine liver was established with visual detection limits (cutoff values) of 50 and 25 ng/g, respectively. The IC50 values calculated from the equation of the standard curve were 6.06 and 3.45 ng/g and the limits of detection were 0.96 and 0.29 ng/g for VAL and TIA. According to the recovery experiment results, the test strip exhibited acceptable accuracy and precision. Generally, the proposed strip provided a practical tool for the detection of VAL and TIA.

METHODS Twelve formalin-fixed fetuses (six females and six males) with a mean gestational age of 27.0 \u00B1 2.04 weeks (range between 25 and 32 weeks) were dissected to evaluate morphological properties of the spinal cord and rootlets. RESULTS Length and width of each spinal cord segment, number of dorsal and ventral rootlets, length of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones of each spinal nerve, spinal cord termination level, and the whole spinal cord length were determined in all fetuses. Contrary to previous reports, the number of ventral rootlets was always more than that of dorsal rootlets in all segments. No statistically significant gender difference was found for all parameters. Rootlet number and segment width in cervical region were larger than those of thoracic, while the lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones in thoracic region were longer than those of cervical. In lumbar region, dorsal and ventral rootlet numbers were increasing again, while lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones were decreasing. Number of dorsal and ventral rootlets of C5 and C6 segments was statistically higher than other cervical segments. The mean spinal cord length was found as 105.55 \u00B1 11.30 mm and there was a positive significant relationship with gestational age. Conus medullaris level was detected between L1 and L3 segments.

Public health authorities (PHAs) are increasingly adopting the use of social media such as Facebook to rapidly communicate and disseminate pandemic response measures to the public. Understanding of communication strategies across different PHAs and examining the public response on the social media landscapes can help in improving practices for disseminating information to the public. OBJECTIVE This study examines COVID-19 related outreach efforts of PHAs in Singapore, the United States (US) and England and the corresponding public response to these outreach efforts on Facebook. METHODS Posts and comments from the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US and Public Health England (PHE) in England, were extracted from 01 Jan 2019 to 18 Mar 2020. Posts published before 01 Jan 2020 were categorized as pre-COVID-19 while the remaining posts were categorized as peri-COVID-19 posts. COVID-19 related posts were identified and classified into themes. Metrics used for measuring outreach and engagement were frequency, mean posts per day (PPD), mean reactions per post (RPP), mean shares per post (SPP) and mean comments per post (CPP). Responses to the COVID-19 posts were measured using frequency, mean sentiment polarity (SP), positive to negative sentiments ratio (PNSR) and positive to negative emotions ratio (PNER). Toxicity in comments were identified and analyzed using frequency, mean likes per toxic comment (LPTC) and mean replies per toxic comment (RPTC). Trend analysis was performed to examine how the metrics varied with key events such as when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. RESULTS MOH published more COVID-19 posts (n=271, PPD=5.0) compared to CDC (n=94, PPD=2.2) and PHE (n=45, PPD=1.4). The mean number of comments per COVID-19 post was highest for CDC (CPP=255.3) compared to MOH (CPP=15.6) and PHE (CPP=12.5). Six major themes were identified, with posts about preventive/safety measures and situation updates being prevalent across the three PHAs. The themes of MOH\u0027s posts were diverse while CDC and PHE posts focused on a few themes. The number of comments spiked alongside key events. Response sentiments for MOH\u0027s COVID-19 posts were largely negative initially but improved over time. Overall, response sentiments for MOH posts (PNSR=0.94) were more favorable compared to response sentiments for CDC (PNSR=0.57) and PHE (PNSR=0.55) posts. Toxic comments were rare (0.01%) across all PHAs. CONCLUSIONS PHAs\u0027 extent of Facebook usage for outreach purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied among the three PHAs, highlighting the strategies and approaches that other PHAs can potentially adopt.

The present study analyzes the long-term outcomes in 13 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for SMAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study of 10 females and three males undergoing surgery between 2001 and 2013 was performed. Demographic, clinical and radiologic data and long-term surgical outcomes were recorded. In 12 patients latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy and in one patient distal laparoscopic gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were performed. The median age was 24 years (20-28), and the median duration of symptoms was 24 months (5-24). The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 11; 92.3%), nausea and vomiting (n = 10; 77%) and weight loss (n = 9; 69.2%). The median operating time was 98 min (86-138) and hospital stay was 3 days (1-14). RESULTS No reconversions occurred, and one patient experienced gastric emptying delay in the immediate postoperative period with spontaneous resolution. In four patients, SMAS was associated with severe stenosis of the celiac trunk which was treated in the same operation, and four patients presented stenosis of the left renal vein (the \u0022nutcracker\u0022 phenomenon). With a median follow-up of 94 months (SD 65.3), eight patients (61.5%) had excellent results. One patient had a relapse of symptoms 4 years after surgery requiring distal gastrectomy, two patients presented delay in gastric emptying following temporary improvement and one patient experienced no improvement. CONCLUSIONS Latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy yields good results in SMAS although it requires other gastric motility disorders to be ruled out for appropriate treatment to be established.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cienfuegos, Javier A; Hurtado-Pardo, Luis; Valent\u00ED, V\u00EDctor; Landecho, Manuel F; Vivas, Isabel; Est\u00E9vez, Mateo G; Diez-Caballero, Alberto; Hern\u00E1ndez-Lizo\u00E1in, Jos\u00E9 Luis; Rotellar, Fernando","journal":"World journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05413-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SMAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SMAS","patients latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy","median duration of symptoms","patient experienced gastric emptying delay","patient distal laparoscopic gastrectomy","CONCLUSIONS Latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy","BACKGROUND Latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy","laparoscopic surgery","median follow-up","median age","distal gastrectomy","long-term outcomes","frequent symptoms","relapse of symptoms","years","months","good results","median operating time","excellent results","long-term surgical outcomes","gastric motility disorders","treatment of choice","severe stenosis","temporary improvement","retrospective study","present study","appropriate treatment","immediate postoperative period","Roux-en","radiologic data","superior mesenteric artery syndrome","females","left renal vein","nutcracker","spontaneous resolution","METHODS","abdominal pain","SD","Y reconstruction","Demographic","MATERIALS","celiac trunk","hospital stay","days","phenomenon","nausea","vomiting","weight loss","reconversions","operation"],"language":"en"},

Current prevention policies consist of hand hygiene and social distancing. Emergencies overloaded health services and shocked the logistics chains in many countries, especially Italy and China. Having more than a quarter of its population being elderly, Japan is at high risk for COVID-19 induced morbidity and mortality. This situation cancelled schedules of all routine group exercise activities for the seniors in Japan. While the outbreak is ongoing, staying at home is safe. However, successive days of being house-ridden and limited movement can lead to excessive physical inactivity. Some elderly who are not moving much can lose a significant amount of muscle strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. It can accelerate the frailty and dependency of the seniors, and subsequently, claiming of care and health services. Moreover, existing and new evidences showed that physical activity can promote antiviral immunity. An alternative to usual group exercise activities is crucial to keep seniors active without affecting social distancing. While staying at home for long, functional exercises maintaining basic level of physical activity and movements are urgently required to be introduced to the seniors in Tokyo and around the world to prevent functional decline. Home exercise is a practical option. Therefore, we made a home-version of the functional training exercise video with different sets of 10-minutes exercise for 7 days a week. This breakthrough alternative may sustain health promotion for the elderly persons to preserve their active aging and maintain optimal health.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aung, Myo Nyein; Yuasa, Motoyuki; Koyanagi, Yuka; Aung, Thin Nyein Nyein; Moolphate, Saiyud; Matsumoto, Hiromichi; Yoshioka, Takashi","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Japan","Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["Home exercise","minutes exercise","seniors active","routine group exercise activities","usual group exercise activities","functional training exercise video","health promotion","optimal health","home-version","functional exercises","COVID","functional decline","Japan","elderly persons","Emergencies overloaded health services","social distancing","basic level of physical activity","excessive physical inactivity","active aging","breakthrough alternative","successive days","novel corona virus infection outbreak","different sets","hand hygiene","pandemic","high risk","muscle strength","flexibility","logistics chains","schedules","induced morbidity","limited movement","Current prevention policies","countries","aerobic capacity","house","new evidences","movements","world","Italy","mortality","situation","population","antiviral immunity","week","practical option","China","quarter","frailty","dependency","Tokyo","care"],"language":"en"},

Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection. Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon. However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19. The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malavolta, Marco; Giacconi, Robertina; Brunetti, Dario; Provinciali, Mauro; Maggi, Fabrizio","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","accumulation of senescent cells","current emergence of SARS","COVID","senotherapeutics","biomedical aging research","future emergence of new viruses","RNA viruses","therapeutic strategies","deleterious consequences","exacerbated inflammatory response","priority area of research","enhanced replication efficiency","influenza virus","mutated ones","age-related diseases","comorbidities","challenge","role","ruxolitinib","testing","higher death rate","older people","idea","unsuccessful attempts","vaccines","infection","development","azithromycin","efficacy","Data","phenomenon","IL","potential","present"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources formal (p=0.001) and informal (p=0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness p=0.000.

The aim of the SAGES Technology and Value Assessment Committee aims is to evaluate the efficacy, value, and safety of WATS3D. METHODS Clinical studies involving WATS3D were identified via a search of the PubMed/Medline databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) conducted in March of 2019 using search terms, such as wide-area transepithelial sampling, three-dimensional (3D) computer-assisted analysis, WATS-3D, Barrett\u0027s esophagus and WATS-3D, Barrett\u0027s esophagus and wide-area transepithelial sampling with three-dimensional computer-assisted analysis, Barrett\u0027s esophagus, and emerging technology. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. RESULTS No significant morbidity or mortality was reported within the literature associated with the WATS3D technology. WATS3D increases diagnostic yield by 38-150% for Barrett\u0027s Esophagus, by 40-150% for Low Grade Dysplasia; and by 420% for High Grade Dysplasia; when compared to forceps biopsy alone. WATS3D technique has very high inter-observer agreement for the pathological diagnosis of non-dysplastic and dysplastic Barrett\u0027s Esophagus.

Its origins lie mainly in the attrition experienced in recent years in the field of new drug discovery. KEY FINDINGS Despite some regulatory and economic challenges, drug repositioning offers many advantages, and a number of recent successes have confirmed both its public health benefits and its commercial value. The first examples of successful drug repositioning mainly came about through serendipity like acetylsalicylic acid, thalidomide, sildenafil or dimethylfumarate. CONCLUSION The history of great-repositioned drugs has given some solutions to various pathologies. Serendipity is not yet useful to find repositioning drugs.

The advantages of endoscopic power assisted adenoidectomy over cold steel adenoidectomy has been well established in the literature. As adenoidectomy is one of the most common paediatric surgical procedure there is always a concern to improve the outcomes and make postoperative experience more pleasant for the paediatric population. Cost difference between a coblator wand and microdebrider blade is always a confounding factor in decision making. The present study was conducted to compare both the techniques of adenoidectomy in terms of certain intraoperative and post operative parameters. The present study was a prospective randomized single blind study conducted in a university hospital on 140 subjects. The patients diagnosed with chronic adenoiditis grade 3-4 were randomly allocated in two groups after following the exclusion and inclusion criteria. the adenoidectomy in two groups; Microdebrider group and Coblation group were compared in terms of intraoperative time, post operative pain score; intraoperative bleeding, surgical field and some common complications. The data was analysed for significance by various statistical tests. The average adenoid size operated in both groups was Grade 3. The intraoperative time taken to complete the procedure in group A was 12.78 \u00B1 3.8 min and in group B was 22 \u00B1 3.3 min with p value \u003C 0.05. There was statistically significant difference in grade of Intraoperative Bleeding in both groups with mean grade of intraoperative bleeding being 1.4 \u00B1 1.04 in group B and 3.5 \u00B1 0.9 in Group A. The surgical field was poor to average in 33 cases (n = 70) in group A as compared to only 1 case (n = 70) in group B; the difference being statistically significant. The average post-operative pain score was 2.69 \u00B1 0.99 and 1.17 \u00B1 1.1 after post-operatively 24 h and 72 h respectively in group B; 7.14 \u00B1 0.99 and 4.08 \u00B1 1.42 respectively in group A. The p value for the same was \u003C 0.05. However there was no statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of any complications or completeness of removal. Though both the techniques are highly efficacious in adenoid removal and low complication rate in our study but still more studies with large sample size are encouraged to validate these results and establish the comparative efficacy of both the techniques in terms of the intraoperative parameters as well as post-operative recovery along with recurrence rates.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Jaskaran; Bhardwaj, Bhanu","journal":"Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-019-01736-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32158657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Microdebrider"],"organizations":["Intraoperative Bleeding"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group B","Microdebrider group","techniques of adenoidectomy","Coblation group","Microdebrider adenoidectomy","groups","Coblation adenoidectomy","intraoperative parameters","terms of intraoperative time","terms of certain intraoperative","mean grade of intraoperative bleeding","significant difference","cold steel adenoidectomy","present study","average post-operative pain score","post-operative recovery","surgical field","Cost difference","average adenoid size","common paediatric surgical procedure","microdebrider blade","new techniques available","adenoid removal","common complications","chronic adenoiditis grade","p value","prospective randomized single blind study","completeness of removal","paediatric population","large sample size","low complication rate","confounding factor","coblator wand","advantages of endoscopic power","postoperative experience","university hospital","significance","outcomes","studies","recurrence rates","days","comparative efficacy","various statistical tests","decision making","results","patients","exclusion","concern","inclusion criteria","data","subjects","cases","literature"],"language":"en"},

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. \u0022convalescent\u0022) plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure to undertake collections and construct inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections and transfusion itself.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective, observational study included 23 consecutive patients with large parastomal hernias who underwent PPP between January 2016 and September 2018. The volume of parastomal hernia (VPH), volume of the abdominal cavity (VAC), and the VPH/VAC ratio were measured before and after PPP using abdominal computed tomography scan data. All the hernias were repaired by a laparoscopic or laparoscopic-open-laparoscopic approach using the intraperitoneal Sugarbaker technique. RESULTS Before and after PPP, the mean VPH was 1442 and 1581 mL (P\u003C0.01), and the mean VAC was 5667 and 9194 mL (P\u003C0.01). The VAC increased by 3527 mL (P\u003C0.01) and was greater than the mean VPH before PPP. The VPH/VAC ratio after PPP was reduced at an average of 8.1% (P\u003C0.01). Fascial closure was achieved in all patients, with no clinical evidence of elevated intra-abdominal pressures. The mean follow-up was 24 months (13 to 40 mo), and, to date, no hernia recurrences have been reported in these patients. CONCLUSIONS PPP is a feasible and useful tool in the surgical management of large parastomal hernias. It passively expands the abdominal volumes, thereby resulting in respiratory adaptation to elevated intra-abdominal pressures.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Fuxin; Ma, Ning; Li, Ying-Ru; Gan, Wen-Chang; Zong, Zhen; Zhou, Tai-Cheng; Chen, Shuang","journal":"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy \u0026 percutaneous techniques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31985570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPP","VAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean VPH","mean VAC","management of parastomal hernias","CONCLUSIONS PPP","surgical management of large parastomal hernias","VAC ratio","abdominal volumes","abdominal cavity","volume of parastomal hernia","consecutive patients","mean follow-up","clinical evidence of elevated intra-abdominal pressures","laparoscopic approach","laparoscopic-open","abdominal computed tomography scan data","observational study","present study","hernia recurrences","useful tool","respiratory adaptation","effectiveness","intraperitoneal Sugarbaker technique","PURPOSE Preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum","METHODS","date","months","Fascial closure","average","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Echocardiographic, transcranial Doppler, and hemodynamic data from 37 neonates with moderate-severe HIE \u002B TH were reviewed. Twenty healthy newborns served as controls. Cardiac dysfunction in HIE \u002B TH was characterized by a predominant RV dysfunction, with concomitantly reduced CBF velocity. A significant correlation was found between CBF velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV output (RVO), and stroke volume (SVRV), as well as with left ventricular output and stroke volume. Brain oxygenation (rSO2) correlated significantly with RVO, SVRV, TAPSE, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, whereas cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) correlated with RVO, SVRV, RV myocardial performance index, and superior vena cava flow. CBF velocity and cerebral NIRS correlations were stronger with parameters of right ventricular performance.Conclusion: CBF velocity and brain oxygenation correlate predominantly with RV function in HIE \u002B TH.

Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives.

In particular, stress tests such as manipulation and temperature changes were conducted through molecular methods to identify the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in stressed animals compared with a control group. The immunohistochemical technique was also applied to locate and study the trends-levels of nitrotyrosine (NT), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in different tissues from stressed animals and control group. The presence of the rodlet cell (RCs) was evaluated by histology in both a control and stressed group. Our results show that the real-time PCR method developed is specific for the evaluated target gene and that manipulation and temperature increase are strong stressors for animals. Relative quantification data revealed a gene expression increase of HSP70 in the stressed group of animals compared to the control group. The antibodies used for the immunohistochemical staining were efficient, and it was possible to appreciate the increase of immunoprecipitates in European sea bass either manipulated or stressed by temperature increase.

One mediator of vitamin D-dependent immune regulation and antimicrobial defense is the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (LL-37), encoded by the cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) gene. We compared the mRNA expression of the CRAMP gene, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, as well as the CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 genes (involved in vitamin D metabolism) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) between depressed individuals who died by suicide (n = 15) and matched (age, gender, and post-mortem interval) non-psychiatric controls (n = 15). Gene expression was measured through qRT-PCR with TaqMan\u00AE primers and probes, with GAPDH and \u03B2-actin genes as endogenous controls. Statistical analyses included t-tests and Pearson correlations. CRAMP mRNA expression was downregulated and VDR mRNA expression was upregulated in both dlPFC and ACC in suicides relative to controls, with no significant differences in expression of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1.

While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting. AIM To share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors. DESIGN Not applicable. POPULATION COVID-19 survivors. METHODS A group of Physical Medicine \u0026 Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services. RESULTS In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peipheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric.

Since the ongoing climate warming is known to alter nutritional environments encountered by ectotherms, a precise understanding of the integrated effects of these two factors on ectotherm performance is essential for improving the accuracy of predictions regarding how ectotherms will respond to climate warming. Here we employed response surface methodology to examine how multiple life-history traits were expressed across a grid of environmental conditions representing full combinations of six ambient temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, 31, 33 \u00B0C) and eight dietary protein:carbohydrate ratios (P:C = 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1) in Drosophila melanogaster. Different life-history traits were maximized in different regions in the two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space. The optimal temperature and P:C ratio identified for adult lifespan (13 \u00B0C and 1:16) were lower than those for early-life female fecundity (28 \u00B0C and 4:1). Similar divergence in thermal and nutritional optima was found between body mass at adult emergence (18 \u00B0C and P:C 1:1) and the rate of pre-adult development (28 \u00B0C and P:C 4:1). Pre-adult survival was maximized over a broad range of temperature (18-28 \u00B0C) and P:C ratio (1:8-8:1). These results indicate that the occurrence of life-history trade-offs is regulated by both temperature and dietary P:C ratio. The estimated measure of fitness was maximized at 23 \u00B0C and P:C 2:1. Based on the shape of the response surface constructed for this estimated fitness, we characterized the fundamental thermal and nutritional niche for D. melanogaster with unprecedented detail.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Keonhee E; Jang, Taehwan; Lee, Kwang Pum","journal":"Oecologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04666-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418116/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C ratio","ectotherms","optimal temperature","Different life-history traits","multiple life-history traits","adult emergence","occurrence of life","adult lifespan","estimated fitness","broad range of temperature","Pre-adult survival","nutritional optima","nutritional niche","nutritional environments","history trade-offs","two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space","rate of pre-adult development","life female fecundity","estimated measure of fitness","response surface methodology","ongoing climate warming","influential environmental determinants of Darwinian fitness","different regions","dietary protein","Drosophila melanogaster","grid of environmental conditions","factors","combinations","body mass","carbohydrate ratios","integrated effects","precise understanding","ectotherm performance","Similar divergence","accuracy of predictions","ambient temperatures","results","shape"],"language":"en"},

We discuss the unique role of IFN\u03BB in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may impair IFN\u03BB induction, leading to a delayed type I IFN-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease.

SUMMARY: Possibilities of vaccination with inactivated virus via the respiratory tract studied in the Aujeszky virus \u2014 white mouse system Using an ethylethelenimin\u2010inactivated and concentrated Aujeszky disease virus vaccine, mice were vaccinated i. m., i. n. and by aerosol. A different immunity resulted from all three routes. The grade of immunity induced and its disposition depended both on the method of application of the vaccine and of the challenge virus. Against parenteral challenge i. m. vaccination was superior to i. n. vaccination. Using i. n. challenge i. n. vaccination was at least as good as i. m. vaccination. Aerosol vaccination with inactivated virus gave significant protection only when adjuvant was included and was in any case less effective than the other two methods of vaccination. I. n. vaccination reduced the spread and multiplication of the i. n. challenge dose almost completely. Aerosol vaccination reduced the number of lung and brain isolations and also the lung virus titres compared with the controls.

RESUMEN: Posibilidades de vacunaci\u00F3n con virus inactivado a trav\u00E9s del tracto respiratorio estudiadas en el sistema virus de Aujeszky\u2010rat\u00F3n blanco Se vacunaron ratones blancos por las v\u00EDas im., in. y con aerosoles mediante una virusvacuna de Aujeszky inactivada con etiletilenimina y concentrada. Con todas las tres formas de administraci\u00F3n se logr\u00F3 una inmudidad diferente. El grado de inmunidad inducida y su valuaci\u00F3n depend\u00EDan del tipo de aplicaci\u00F3n, tanto de las vacunas como del virus de infecci\u00F3n de prueba. Frente a la infecci\u00F3n parenteral se revel\u00F3 la vacunaci\u00F3n im. muy superior a la vacunaci\u00F3n in., pero tras la infecci\u00F3n in. de prueba era la inmunizaci\u00F3n lograda por v\u00EDa in. equivalente al menos a la im. La vacunaci\u00F3n aeros\u00F3lica con virus inactivado de Aujeszky induc\u00EDa solo con adici\u00F3n de adyuvante una protecci\u00F3n significativa, la cual, sin embargo, era bastante inferior en comparaci\u00F3n con los otros tipos de aplicaci\u00F3n.\u00E4La vacunaci\u00F3n in. reduc\u00EDa asi por completo la multiplicaci\u00F3n y difusi\u00F3n del virus de infecci\u00F3n de prueba aplicado por v\u00EDa in. La vacunaci\u00F3n por medio de aerosoles disminu\u00EDa frente a los testigos tanto el n\u00FAmero de aislamientos en pulmones y cerebros como el nivel de los t\u00EDtulos vir\u00F3sicos pulmonares. Solo se pudieron identificar anticuerpos neutralizantes en el suero sangu\u00EDneo de ratones vacunados por las v\u00EDas im. e in., ya que no tras vacunaci\u00F3n aeros\u00F3lica. En los l\u00EDquidos de lavado pulmonar y en extractos pulmonares no se hallaron en ning\u00FAn caso anticuerpos neutralizantes.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neukirch, M.; Bauer,

These methods are now widely replaced with appropriate DNA- and RNA-based amplification techniques, in particular real time PCR amplification, for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for acute respiratory infections. Real-time PCR offers rapid results, efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results due to contamination. As a result, better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care. In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use, the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of real-time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens. However this must be done within a context of resource availability, technical expertise available and clinical utility. It seems certain that molecular microbiology will continue to develop, leading to further applications in diagnostic technology, thereby improving our understanding of disease processes and enhancing our knowledge of the pathogens responsible.","publish_time":"2010-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nissen, Michael D.; Lambert, Stephen B.; Whiley, David M.; Sloots, Theo P.","journal":"PCR for Clinical Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d2366b0ee4d6b5ec8c8b7376e7b343fa15e0ff8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of respiratory viruses","acute respiratory infections","rapid results","Real-time PCR","diagnostic strategy","diagnostic use","pathogens responsible","diagnostic technology","molecular methods","non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens","RNA-based amplification techniques","combination of real-time amplification tests","particular real time PCR amplification","enhanced efficiencies","molecular microbiology","reduced risk of false positive results","technical expertise available","conventional culture techniques","extended number of agents responsible","reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration","work flow","better patient management","immunofluorecence assays","gold standard","context of resource availability","laboratory","clinical utility","health care","appropriate DNA","knowledge","understanding of disease processes","specificity","contamination","sensitivity","applications"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we first (Sect. 7.1) recapitulate the development of these arrays and highlight a couple of key improvements in the array production and the application in proteomics research. For clinical and biomarker development applications, it is important to measure entities that are directly related to physiological function (and dysfunction). In this respect, the assessment of enzymatic activities is obviously preferable to genotyping, expression profiling, or even measurement of protein amounts. In Sect. 7.2, an original technology based on peptides arrayed onto a porous support allows detailed profiling of kinase activities in a biological sample. The applications described range from kinase characterization to inhibition profiles, detection of off-target effects, and drug response prediction in a clinical setting, allowing rational choice of the drug to be used. Such directly functional approaches will have an important role in the transition to more personalized medicine. Finally, in Sect. 7.3, a recently developed method for \u201Claser printing\u201D of peptide arrays that will make these approaches much more practical is presented.","publish_time":"2012-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hong; Pelech, Steven; Ruijtenbeek, Rob; Felgenhauer, Thomas; Bischoff, Ralf; Breitling, Frank; Stadler, Volker","journal":"Microarrays in Diagnostics and Biomarker Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3ae72f7d561d0efb3293e1fe7e5417ecc0cee29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide arrays","kinase characterization","detailed profiling of kinase activities","enzymatic activity profiling","broad range of applications","expression profiling","biomarker development applications","proteomics research","characterization of molecular interactions","assessment of enzymatic activities","molecular probes","clinical setting","important role","use of peptides","functional approaches","drug response prediction","antibody screening","epitope mapping","array production","detection","proteins","target effects","inhibition profiles","porous support","result","laser printing","potential loss of structural information","couple of key improvements","transition","rational choice","biological sample","concern","developed method","measurement of protein amounts","valuable tool","respect","physiological function","personalized medicine","dysfunction","original technology","entities","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The genus is established for two new species found in Australia, P. enalios sp. nov., an intertidal form, and P. winsori sp. nov., which lives in fallen timber in the supralittoral brackish water regions of mangrove swamps. One only of the known species of land nemerteans, Geonemertes agricola from Bermuda, closely resembles these two species morphologically and is transferred to the new genus as Pantinonemertes agricola. A re\u2010examination of all the known species of Geonemertes has shown that two major groups can be distinguished on the basis of morphological characters. In one group the rhynchocoel musculature is in two distinct layers, a frontal organ is present, the mid\u2010dorsal blood vessel has a single vascular plug, and the flame cells are binucleate and reinforced with cuticular support bars. It comprises the genus Pantinonemertes gen, nov, and the Pelaensis or Indopacific group of terrestrial nemerteans, for which the generic name Geonemertes is retained. In the second major group the rhynchocoel musculature is composed of interwoven longitudinal and circular fibres, there is no frontal organ, the mid\u2010dorsal blood vessel bears two vascular plugs, and the flame cells are mononucleate and lack support bars. Five genera, three of which are new, are distinguished in this group. Australian species are united in the genus Argonemertes gen. nov., and New Zealand forms comprise the genus Antiponemertes gen. nov., while Acteonemertes bathamae from New Zealand and the Auckland and Ocean Islands remains in a separate genus. Geonemertes nightingaleensis is transferred to a new genus, Katechonemertes gen. nov., and for Geonemertes chalicophora a previously used generic name, Leptonemertes, is adopted.

Avian influenza (AI) viruses primarily circulate in wild waterfowl populations and are occasionally transmitted to domestic poultry flocks. However, the possible roles of other wildlife species, such as wild mammals, in AI virus ecology have not been adequately addressed. 2.. Due to their habitat and behaviour, many wild mammals may be capable of transmitting pathogens among wild and domestic populations. Exposure to AI viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals. The presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry AI outbreak in North America. These reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to AI viruses. 3.. Serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry, domestic swine and human exposure to influenza A viruses, but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals. As such, some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals. Herein, we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild mammals. We call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation, and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains.","publish_time":"2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"VANDALEN, KACI K.; SHRINER, SUSAN A.; SULLIVAN, HEATHER J.; ROOT, J.

The proposed submodule also uses several processing steps, including the use of various stemming methods, the use of word stop-lists or other lexical structures, the use of stochastic keyword ranking using a weight table, etc.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tarasiev, Andrey; Filippova, Margarita; Aksyonov, Konstantin; Aksyonova, Olga; Antonova, Anna","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/946df51b719d989e317280090b2b783d781450b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed system","customizable automated system","post-processing module","post-processing subsystem","processing steps","proposed submodule","article","use of stochastic keyword ranking","use of word stop-lists","use of various stemming methods","speech recognition schemes","third-party speech recognition systems","real-time text","recognized text","automated robot","example of Russian","decision support submodule","center operator","lexical structures","voice dialogs","smart chat bots","developed flexible architecture","interacting microservices","assistants","weight table","English dictionary models","idea","user","paper","subject area","independent submodules"],"language":"en"},

These feature vectors (graph descriptors) are used to measure the pairwise similarity between graphs. This enables applying data mining algorithms (e.g classification, clustering, or anomaly detection) on graph-structured data which have numerous applications in multiple domains. State-of-the-art algorithms for computing descriptors require the entire graph to be in memory, entailing a huge memory footprint, and thus do not scale well to increasing sizes of real-world networks. In this work, we propose streaming algorithms to efficiently approximate descriptors by estimating counts of sub-graphs of order [Formula: see text], and thereby devise extensions of two existing graph comparison paradigms: the Graphlet Kernel and NetSimile. Our algorithms require a single scan over the edge stream, have space complexity that is a fraction of the input size, and approximate embeddings via a simple sampling scheme. Our design exploits the trade-off between available memory and estimation accuracy to provide a method that works well for limited memory requirements. We perform extensive experiments on real-world networks and demonstrate that our algorithms scale well to massive graphs.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassan, Zohair Raza; Shabbir, Mudassir; Khan, Imdadullah; Abbas, Waseem","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42e85f549c1c4baea8acc79b8e23d9e6d7ef7b43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graph descriptors","algorithms scale","entire graph","graph analytics","streaming algorithms","State-of-the-art algorithms","graph-structured data","data mining algorithms","approximate descriptors","available memory","existing graph comparison paradigms","computing descriptors","huge memory footprint","limited memory requirements","sizes of real-world networks","massive graphs","approximate embeddings","space complexity","fixed dimensional feature space","counts of sub-graphs of order","feature vectors","g classification","fundamental task","anomaly detection","numerous applications","Graphlet Kernel","essential structural properties","clustering","edge stream","trade-off","estimation accuracy","extensions","fraction","input size","simple sampling scheme","Formula","method","single scan","multiple domains","text","NetSimile","design","extensive experiments","similarity"],"language":"en"},

In general, ReID is an extremely challenging task due to complex background clutters, large pose variations and severe occlusions. To improve its performance, a robust and discriminative feature extraction methodology is particularly crucial. Recently, the feature alignment technique driven by human pose estimation, that is, matching two person images with their corresponding parts, increases the effectiveness of ReID to a certain extent. However, we argue that there are still a few problems among these methods such as imprecise handcrafted segmentation of body parts, and some improvements can be further achieved. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Mask-Guided Region Attention Network (MGRAN) for person ReID. MGRAN consists of two major components: Mask-guided Region Attention (MRA) and Multi-feature Alignment (MA). MRA aims to generate spatial attention masks and meanwhile mask out the background clutters and occlusions. Moreover, the generated masks are utilized for region-level feature alignment in the MA module.

Recently, deep learning models have been increasingly applied to ECG classification. Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification. However, this methodology has two drawbacks. First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Second, beat-wise classification risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to achieving high classification performance. Addressing these drawbacks, we propose a novel deep learning model that can simultaneously conduct heartbeat segmentation and classification. Compared to existing methods, our model is more compact as it does not require explicit heartbeat segmentation. Moreover, our model is more context-aware, for it takes into account the relationship between heartbeats. To achieve simultaneous segmentation and classification, we present a Faster R-CNN based model that has been customized to handle ECG data. To characterize inter-heartbeat context information, we exploit inverted residual blocks and a novel feature fusion subroutine that combines average pooling with max-pooling. Extensive experiments on the well-known MIT-BIH database indicate that our method can achieve competitive results for ECG segmentation and classification.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Xi; Liang, Shen; Zhang, Yanchun","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1592129b251efc1e31bb644e826ef6a9dfc779f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECG classification","ECG segmentation","explicit heartbeat segmentation","simultaneous segmentation","wise classification risks","inter-heartbeat context information","model simplicity","ECG heartbeats","high classification performance","novel deep learning model","ECG data","context-aware","drawbacks","deep learning models","average pooling","max-pooling","existing methods","novel feature fusion subroutine","inverted residual blocks","important research topic","well-known MIT-BIH database","competitive results","steps","preprocessing","Extensive experiments","Faster R-CNN","healthcare","account","Arrhythmia detection","compactness","relationship","methodology"],"language":"en"},

Learning such tasks requires both efficient exploitation and exploration to reduce the sample complexity. One line of research called self-imitation learning is recently proposed, which encourages the agent to do more exploitation by imitating past good trajectories. Exploration bonuses, however, is another line of research which enhances exploration by producing intrinsic reward when the agent visits novel states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Explore-then-Exploit (EE), which interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to strengthen the effect of these two algorithms. In the exploring stage, with the aid of intrinsic reward, the agent tends to explore unseen states and occasionally collect high rewarding experiences, while in the self-imitating stage, the agent learns to consistently reproduce such experiences and thus provides a better starting point for subsequent stages.

More specifically, we leverage graph sampling techniques for sampling non-hyperlinks in hyperlink prediction. Our analysis clearly establishes the effect of random sampling, which is the norm in both link- as well as hyperlink-prediction. Further, we formalize the notion of \u201Chardness\u201D of non-hyperlinks via a measure of density, and analyze its distribution over various negative sampling techniques. We experiment with some real-world hypergraph datasets and provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the effects of negative sampling.

We propose an empirical model, based on the assumption of finite n-gram language vocabularies, to estimate the number of distinct n-grams in large corpora, as well as the sizes of the equal-frequency n-gram groups, which occur in the lower frequencies starting from 1. The model was validated for n-grams with [Formula: see text], by a wide range of real corpora in English and French, from 60 million up to 8 billion words. These are full non-truncated corpora data, that is, their associated frequency data include the entire range of observed n-gram frequencies, from 1 up to the maximum. The model predicts the monotonic growth of the numbers of distinct n-grams until reaching asymptotic plateaux when the corpus size grows to infinity. It also predicts the non-monotonicity of the sizes of the equal-frequency n-gram groups as a function of the corpus size.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, Joaquim F.; Cunha, Jose C.","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02485de88c257916a3ff976943181149c2d77b0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["n-gram frequency distributions","equal-frequency n-gram groups","large corpora","numbers of distinct n-grams","number of distinct n-grams","entire range of observed n-gram frequencies","assumption of finite n-gram language vocabularies","natural language corpora","small scale corpora","non-truncated corpora data","associated frequency data","wide range of real corpora","text","sizes","large scale behavior","corpus size","Formula","empirical model","non-monotonicity","lower frequencies","indexing","time","investigation","asymptotic plateaux","English","new challenges","function","monotonic growth","space optimization purposes","knowledge","Statistical multiword extraction methods","French","appearance","infinity","words","maximum"],"language":"en"},

This is attributed to significant manual efforts required for assigning job posts with RIASEC labels. To cope with assigning massive number of jobs with RIASEC labels, we propose JPLink, a machine learning approach using the text content in job titles and job descriptions. JPLink exploits domain knowledge available in an occupation-specific knowledge base known as O*NET to improve feature representation of job posts.

A substantial body of evidence for health systems strengthening is generated in SA, and this informs national and international health system guidelines and guidance. In this manuscript, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the SA Medical Research Council, we apply an evidence ecosystem lens to the SA health system, and discuss its current functioning in support of the achievement of a high-quality health system that is able to achieve universal health coverage. We use three case studies to describe successes, challenges and gaps in the functioning of the evidence ecosystem. The first case study focuses on using evidence to strengthen health-system governance and support for community health worker programmes. The second case focuses on managing the growing epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while the third case focuses on social protection, the child support grant and its impact on health. SA scientists are part of global initiatives to strengthen the health-systems evidence ecosystem, specifically through pioneering methods to synthesise evidence and produce evidence-informed guidelines to facilitate evidence use in health-system decision-making. SA institutes of health policy analysis facilitate involvement of evidence producers and synthesisers in the national health system policy-making process. A future priority is to further strengthen national initiatives to translate evidence into policy and practice and to sustain capacity for continuous technical support to health-systems policy development and implementation.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathews, C; Goga, A; Loveday, M; Zembe, W; Daviaud, E; Siegfried, N; Lewin, S","journal":"South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2019.v109i11b.14245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["health systems","health-systems evidence ecosystem","SA health system","evidence synthesisers","HPSR evidence","evidence processers","evidence implementors","high-quality health system","health-system governance","health-system decision-making","national health system policy","evidence ecosystem lens","health-systems policy development","universal health coverage","international health system guidelines","involvement of evidence producers","evidence-informed guidelines","guides health system reforms","substantial body of evidence","SA institutes of health policy analysis","community health worker programmes","systems research","SA scientists","national initiatives","SA Medical Research Council","case studies","case study","continuous technical support","child support grant","universal coverage of high-quality healthcare","current functioning","global initiatives","s progress","disseminators","South Africa","capacity","achievement","resistant tuberculosis","challenges","anniversary","social protection","growing epidemic of drug","pioneering methods","successes","gaps","impact","practice","guidance","implementation","future priority","celebration","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation and difficulties with self-management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to re-defining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Due to this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients\u0027 needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementation science research.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Leung, Samantha E; Cassin, Stephanie E","journal":"Obesity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individuals","bariatric surgery programs","virtual care models","rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care","remote delivery of care","pandemic","obesity management","increased emotional distress","reach of psychosocial services","novel approaches","self-management","increased eating psychopathology","psychological sequalae secondary","tremendous psychological impact","global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","mental health exacerbation","new opportunities","patients\u0027 needs","difficulties","weight","implementation science research","online modalities","COVID","impairment","detrimental effects","Emerging evidence","challenges","world","quality of life"],"language":"en"},

It has been proposed that shortening the ASA dosing interval may overcome the time-dependent renewal of the drug target, leading to a greater antiplatelet effect. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy of once- versus twice-daily ASA in conditions with increased platelet turnover. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for RCTs assessing once- versus twice-daily ASA. Data were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers, and were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2). Other pharmacodynamic measures were retrieved as secondary outcomes. Results were reported as mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS Seven RCTs were included, enrolling 379 participants overall. None of the studies reported clinical outcomes. Pooled results showed that compared with once-daily ASA, twice-daily ASA was associated with a decrease in mean TxB2 of 1.42 ng/mL (95% CI - 2.71 to - 0.13; I2 = 66%). We found no differences in subgroup analyses based on disease subtype, trial blinding, or trial design. A greater antiplatelet activity of the twice-daily regimen was also found when using PFA-100-ADP methods, although not when using the VerifyNow, LTA-AA, and multiplate methods. CONCLUSIONS Twice-daily ASA was associated with a greater antiplatelet effect compared with standard once-daily ASA.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mainoli, Beatrice; Duarte, Gon\u00E7alo S; Costa, Jo\u00E3o; Ferreira, Joaquim; Caldeira, Daniel","journal":"American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40256-020-00409-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["daily ASA","daily regimen","ASA dosing interval","greater antiplatelet effect","antiplatelet responses","greater antiplatelet activity","RCTs","antiplatelet agent","Pooled results","Systematic Reviews","Meta-Analyses","primary outcomes","mean differences","secondary outcomes","mean TxB2","clinical outcomes","multiplate methods","ADP methods","systematic review of randomized controlled trials","meta-analysis","trial blinding","subgroup analyses","trial design","recurrent ischemic events","major adverse cardiovascular events","MACEs","disease subtype","time-dependent renewal","MEDLINE","serum thromboxane B2","drug target","Preferred Reporting Items","PRISMA","conditions","individuals","decrease","standard","increased platelet turnover","confidence intervals","LTA-AA","Embase databases","CIs","PFA","pharmacodynamic measures","guidelines","BACKGROUND Acetylsalicylic acid","random-effects model","VerifyNow","studies","CONCLUSIONS","independent reviewers","efficacy","participants","I2"],"language":"en"},

This model considers the ankle plantarflexors to act as a single synergistic group. There are differences in muscle properties among the medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG, respectively) and the soleus that may affect their activation. Twelve volunteers participated in an investigation to determine whether the activation of the ankle plantarflexor muscles was modulated according to perturbation direction during unilateral standing perturbations of 1% body mass. High-density surface electromyography (HDS-EMG) was used to determine the amplitude and barycenter of the muscle activation and kinematic analysis was used to evaluate ankle, knee, and hip joint movement. The HDS-EMG amplitude and barycenter of MG and LG were modulated with the perturbation direction (MG p \u003C 0.05; LG p \u003C 0.01; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA). In soleus, the HDS-EMG barycenter modulated across the perturbation direction (p \u003C 0.01 for X\u0026Y coordinates), but the HDS-EMG amplitude did not change. A repeated-measures correlation was used to interpret the HDS-EMG pattern in the context of the kinematics. The relative contribution of MG activation compared to the total gastrocnemii activation was significantly associated with ankle dorsi/plantarflexion (rrm = 0.620), knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.622 and rrm = 0.547, respectively), and hip flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.653 and rrm = 0.432, respectively). The findings suggest that the central nervous system activates motor units within different regions of MG, LG and SOL in response to standing perturbations in different directions.","publish_time":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, J W; Gallina, A; Ivanova, T D; Vieira, T; McAndrew, D J; Garland, S J","journal":"Experimental brain research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-019-05696-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31760455/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LG","SOL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rrm","HDS-EMG barycenter","HDS-EMG amplitude","HDS-EMG pattern","muscle activation","LG p","perturbation direction","ankle plantarflexors","ankle dorsi","total gastrocnemii activation","extension","abduction","adduction","knee flexion","ankle plantarflexor muscles","unilateral standing perturbations","hip flexion","soleus","repeated-measures correlation","different regions","muscle properties","different directions","one-way repeated-measures ANOVA","Maintenance of upright standing posture","hip joint movement","inverted pendulum model","central nervous system","motor units","response","lateral gastrocnemius","kinematic analysis","context","High-density surface electromyography","body mass","Y coordinates","findings","single synergistic group","differences","plantarflexion","kinematics","investigation","relative contribution","volunteers"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of approved marketed drugs against coronaviruses, the treatment and management of this novel CoV disease (COVID-19) worldwide is a challenge. Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery. Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection. Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis.

Based on clinical symptoms, laboratory evaluation, and imaging, the causative pathogen often cannot be delineated. Point-of-care-testing systems that provide an opportunity for fast detection of common viruses and some bacteria can therefore influence treatment\u0027s options. We aimed to examine whether the Biofire\u00AE FilmArray\u00AE has an effect on antibiotic treatment, duration of antibiotic therapy, and length of hospital stay within a pediatric cohort. METHODS We included children who were admitted to inpatient treatment with an acute respiratory tract infection from 02/2017 to 04/2018 using the FA respiratory panel for pathogen detection. The study group data were compared to the retrospective data of children admitted from 02/2016 to 02/2017, using a proprietary multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS A total of 322 children of the study group and 464 children of the control group were analyzed for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, antibiotic treatment, and length of hospital stay. There was no significant reduction (P \u003C .05) of antibiotic treatment and length of hospital stay. CRP, prehospital antibiotic treatment, antibiotic treatment, past medical history, age, and further pathogen detection showed a significant impact on antibiotic therapy, duration of antibiotic treatment, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION The use of the FA did not result in a significant reduction of antibiotic treatment or in length of hospital stay. Other parameters had a more significant impact. Therefore, we suggest that standard operation procedures with therapy guidelines are necessary to provide an effective application of POCT systems.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reischl, Anna Theresa; Schreiner, Daniel; Poplawska, Krystyna; Kidszun, Andr\u00E9; Zepp, Fred; Gr\u00F6ndahl, Britta; Gehring, Stephan","journal":"Journal of clinical laboratory analysis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of antibiotic treatment","prehospital antibiotic treatment","significant reduction of antibiotic treatment","length of hospital","duration of antibiotic therapy","inpatient treatment","pathogen detection","significant impact","BACKGROUND Children","retrospective data of children","study group data","therapy guidelines","clinical symptoms","FA respiratory panel","control group","respiratory tract infections","causative pathogen","acute respiratory tract infection","fast detection of common viruses","laboratory findings","laboratory evaluation","care-testing systems","effective application of POCT systems","past medical history","opportunity","age","bacteria","imaging","standard operation procedures","CRP","proprietary multiplex RT-PCR","FilmArray","pediatric cohort","treatment\u0027s options","Point","Biofire","CONCLUSION","parameters","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The data on 8,958 twin pairs (3,108 MZ twin pairs and 5,850 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study were analysed. CU traits were assessed at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 by mothers and analysed using a biometric latent growth model. RESULTS Individual differences in the baseline level of CU traits were highly heritable (76.5%), while the heritability of the developmental course of CU traits was moderate (43.6%). The genetic influences on baseline level and developmental course of CU traits were mostly nonoverlapping. Nonshared environment made a modest contribution to the baseline level of CU traits (21.7%). Nonshared environmental influences on the developmental course of CU traits were moderate (43.2%), with nearly half of them being the same as those influencing the baseline level and just over half being specific. Shared environmental effects did not contribute to systematic change across childhood and adolescence but were rather age-specific. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that rather than only being conceptualized as factors of stability, genes also play a dynamic role in explaining systematic change in CU traits. Genetic effects for the initial risk and subsequent development of CU traits are not the same. In addition to genetic factors, nonshared environmental influences play an important role in explaining why some children will increase or maintain their CU traits over time, whereas other will desist. New genetic and environmental influences with age suggest that repeated, age-tailored interventions may be required throughout development to make a lasting difference in the presentation of CU traits and associated outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi, Yusuke; Pease, Christopher R; Pingault, Jean-Baptiste; Viding, Essi","journal":"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["baseline level of CU traits","presentation of CU traits","developmental course of CU traits","subsequent development of CU traits","genetic influences","Nonshared environmental influences","environmental influences underlying baseline level","Genetic effects","genetic factors","developmental course of callous","Shared environmental effects","age-specific","DZ twin pairs","MZ twin pairs","systematic change","childhood","adolescence","half","Twins Early Development Study","age-tailored interventions","dynamic role","important role","factors of stability","initial risk","modest contribution","lasting difference","RESULTS Individual differences","genes","associated outcomes","addition","biometric latent growth model","METHODS","data","children","heritability","nonoverlapping","mothers","BACKGROUND","ages","time","CONCLUSIONS","findings"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we describe our initial experience performing complex abdominal wall repair (CAWR) utilizing component separation and P4HB mesh as onlay reinforcement. METHODS All patients undergoing CAWR between June 2014 and May 2017 were followed prospectively for postoperative outcomes. Only those patients who underwent components separation with primary repair of the fascial edges followed by onlay of P4HB mesh were included in this study. RESULTS 105 patients (52 male, 53 female; mean age 59.2 years, range 22-84) met inclusion criteria. Mean BMI was 29.1 (range 16-48); 52% patients had prior attempted hernia repair, most with multiple medical comorbidities (71% of patients with ASA 3 or greater). 30% of cases were not clean at the time of repair (CDC class 2 or greater). Median follow-up was 36 months (range 9-63). Eighteen patients (17%) developed a hernia recurrence ranging from 2 to 36 months postoperatively. Five (5%) patients developed a localized superficial infection treated with antibiotics, three (2.8%) required re-operation for non-healing wounds, and six (6%) patients developed seroma. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate a relatively low rate of hernia recurrence, seroma, and other common complications of CAWR in a highly morbid patient population. Importantly, the rate of mesh infection was low and no patients required complete mesh removal, even when placed into a contaminated or infected surgical field.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levy, Adam S; Bernstein, Jaime L; Premaratne, Ishani D; Rohde, Christine H; Otterburn, David M; Morrison, Kerry A; Lieberman, Michael; Pomp, Alfons; Spector, Jason A","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07601-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAWR","ASA","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","onlay of P4HB mesh","rate of mesh infection","range","primary repair","time of repair","complete mesh removal","prior attempted hernia repair","low rate of hernia recurrence","onlay reinforcement","seroma","months","complex abdominal wall repair","common complications of CAWR","component separation","components separation","mean age","Mean BMI","soft tissue reinforcement","localized superficial infection","fascial edges","Phasix","hydroxybutyric acid","initial experience","female","multiple medical comorbidities","re-operation","non-healing wounds","CDC class","use","morbid patient population","infected surgical field","biosynthetic polymer","BACKGROUND Poly","years","antibiotics","data","Median follow-up","hydrolysis","cases","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","ASA","study","METHODS","postoperative outcomes","inclusion criteria"],"language":"en"},

However, conventional network embedding models are developed for static structures, commonly consider nodes only and they are seriously challenged when the network is varying in time. Temporal networks may provide an advantage in the description of real systems, but they code more complex information, which could be effectively represented only by a handful of methods so far. Here, we propose a new method of event embedding of temporal networks, called weg2vec, which builds on temporal and structural similarities of events to learn a low dimensional representation of a temporal network. This projection successfully captures latent structures and similarities between events involving different nodes at different times and provides ways to predict the final outcome of spreading processes unfolding on the temporal structure.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torricelli, Maddalena; Karsai, M\u00E1rton; Gauvin, Laetitia","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63221-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Temporal networks","temporal structure","conventional network","structural similarities of events","different nodes","different times","latent structures","static structures","structural regularities","low dimensional representation","ways","advantage","processes","models","techniques","new method of event","description of real systems","final outcome","projection","weg2vec","local fabrics","complex information","handful of methods"],"language":"en"},

In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used Ultrasound-Guided Minimally Invasive Autopsy (MIA-US) to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19 and present the results of ten initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology and RT-PCR to detect SARS-COV-2-RNA. All patients presented exudative/proliferative Diffuse Alveolar Damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients and all patients presented a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major events in the lungs and involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes are the result of severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena. These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nunes Duarte-Neto, Amaro; de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida; da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz; Malheiros, Denise Maria Avancini Costa; de Oliveira, Ellen Pierre; Theodoro Filho, Jair; Pinho, Jo\u00E3o Renato Rebello; Soares Gomes-Gouv\u00EAa, Michele; Salles, Ana Paula Moreira; de Oliveira, Ilka Regina Souza; Mauad, Thais; do Nascimento Saldiva, Paulo Hil\u00E1rio; Dolhnikoff, Marisa","journal":"Histopathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fibrinous"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["systemic involvement of COVID","patients","study of severe COVID","number of COVID","systemic disease","alveolar arterioles","alveolar cells","CONCLUSIONS MIA-US","main systemic findings","testis","spleen","heart","vascular injury","proliferative Diffuse Alveolar Damage","high density of alveolar megakaryocytes","novel disease","results","result of severe epithelial injury","tissue sampling of lungs","possible tissue damage","liver sinusoids","Fibrinous thrombi","Small thrombi","initial autopsies","associated conditions","microthrombotic vascular phenomena","involvement of various organs","respiratory epithelium","skeletal muscle","brain","skin","dermis","kidneys","viral infection","myositis","dermatitis","RT-PCR","sepsis","histology","addition","comorbidities","major events","intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects","Ultrasound","airway","pathophysiology","glomeruli","Invasive Autopsy","cases","SARS-COV","Pulmonary changes","s mortality rate","biosafety recommendations","myocarditis","orchitis","tissues","therapeutic approaches","order","RNA","context","Brazil"],"language":"en"},

However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, early treat, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from 77 clinical throat swabs, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey. According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively. Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge. Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suo, Tao; Liu, Xinjin; Feng, Jiangpeng; Guo, Ming; Hu, Wenjia; Guo, Dong; Ullah, Hafiz; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Qiuhan; Wang, Xin; Sajid, Muhanmmad; Huang, Zhixiang; Deng, Liping; Chen, Tielong; Liu, Fang; Xu, Ke; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Yingle; Xiong, Yong; Chen, Guozhong; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu","journal":"Emerging microbes \u0026 infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1772678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative RT-PCR reports","current standard RT-PCR","limitations of RT","feasibility of ddPCR","clinical detection of SARS","detectable SARS-CoV","clinical diagnosis of SARS","optimized droplet digital PCR","Quantitative real time PCR","significant numbers of false negative reports","negative likelihood ratio","limit of detection","clinical throat swabs","gold standard","diagnostic accuracy","discharge criteria","results of follow-up survey","days post discharge","NPV","PPV","nucleic acid","patients","NLR","COVID","low viral load specimens","powerful complement","transmission","specificity","situation","terms","superiority","early treat","failure","samples","sensitivity","study","convalescents"],"language":"en"},

The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.

In the light of the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the most efficient tool to find therapeutic solution. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to summarize in vitro data of current agents used for the management of SARSCoV-2 all over the world. METHODS A literature search of articles from January 2000 until April 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to assess in vitro data of current or putative therapies for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Although in vitro studies are scarce, data regarding chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, ivermectin, lopinavir, homoharringtonine and emetine seem promising.

To ascertain the evidence on this topic, we conducted an in-depth literature review using the PRISMA checklist. The search parameters included US articles written in English and published since 2000. More than 30,000 potential paper titles were identified and ultimately, 45 papers were selected for inclusion. Green spaces typically comprised tree cover, parks and ground cover. Criminal behaviors typically included murder, assault, and theft. The majority of the research reviewed involved quantitative methods (e.g., comparison of green space area to crime data). We extracted multiple mechanisms from the literature that may account for the impact of green space on crime including social interaction and recreation, community perception, biophilic stress reduction, climate modulation, and spaces expressing territorial definition. Recommendations are made for future research, such as meta-analysis of existing data and the development of grounded theory through qualitative data-gathering methods.

Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 days. The studies showed that while Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 days, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection. The studies also demonstrated significant challenges to measuring Cr(VI) below 100 ng/L, as the results can be subject to positive bias or contamination that may not be readily apparent.

We hypothesized that frailty would be independently associated with decreased functional status, increased discharge to a nonhome location, and longer duration of hospitalization after cardiac surgery, and that delirium would modify these associations. METHODS This was an observational study nested in 2 trials, each of which was conducted by the same research team with identical measurement of exposures and outcomes. The Fried frailty scale was measured at baseline. The primary outcome (defined before data collection) was functional decline, defined as \u22652-point decline from baseline in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score at 1 month after surgery. Secondary outcomes were absolute decline in IADL score, discharge to a new nonhome location, and duration of hospitalization. Associations were analyzed using linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models with adjustments for variables considered before analysis (age, gender, race, and logistic European Score for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [EuroSCORE]) and in a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Data were available from 133 patients (83 from first trial and 50 from the second trial). The prevalence of frailty was 33% (44 of 133). In adjusted models, frail patients had increased odds of functional decline (primary outcome; odds ratio [OR], 2.41 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.03-5.63]; P = .04) and greater decline at 1 month in the secondary outcome of absolute IADL score (-1.48 [95% CI, -2.77 to -0.30]; P = .019), compared to nonfrail patients. Delirium significantly modified the association of frailty and change in absolute IADL score at 1 month. In adjusted hypothesis-generating models using secondary outcomes, frail patients had increased discharge to a new nonhome location (OR, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.37-7.69]; P = .007) and increased duration of hospitalization (1.35 days [95% CI, 1.19-1.52]; P \u003C .0001) compared to nonfrail patients. The increased duration of hospitalization, but no change in functional status or discharge location, was partially mediated by increased complications in frail patients. CONCLUSIONS Frailty may identify patients at risk of functional decline at 1 month after cardiac surgery. Perioperative strategies to optimize frail cardiac surgery patients are needed.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakano, Mitsunori; Nomura, Yohei; Suffredini, Giancarlo; Bush, Brian; Tian, Jing; Yamaguchi, Atsushi; Walston, Jeremy; Hasan, Rani; Mandal, Kaushik; Schena, Stefano; Hogue, Charles W; Brown, Charles H","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Instrumental Activities of Daily Living","IADL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased discharge","frail cardiac surgery patients","increased odds of functional decline","increased duration of hospitalization","functional outcomes","nonfrail patients","risk of functional decline","absolute decline","increased length","discharge location","increased complications","month","secondary outcome of absolute IADL score","Secondary outcomes","greater decline","association of frailty","CONCLUSIONS Frailty","prevalence of frailty","logistic European Score","new nonhome location","decreased functional status","propensity score analysis","longer duration of hospitalization","Fried frailty scale","primary outcome","adjusted models","Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation","baseline","change","delirium","associations","Poisson regression models","odds ratio","data collection","RESULTS Data","adjusted hypothesis","variables","race","Instrumental Activities of Daily Living","identical measurement of exposures","gender","adjustments","EuroSCORE","major morbidity","Perioperative strategies","research team","age","mortality","days","studies","observational study","METHODS","trials","confidence interval","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The current study established a burn model in rats and used a free radical scavenger edaravone (ED) to treat the rats, so as to investigate the effect of edaravone on intestinal mucosa barrier after burn injury. METHODS Anesthetized rats were subjected to 40% total body surface area water burn immediately, followed by treatment with ED, scrambled antagomir, or antagomiR-320. Intestinal mucosa damage was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and graded by colon mucosal damage index (CMDI) score. The contents of total sulfhydryl (TSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by spectrophotometry. Cell apoptosis, protein relative expression,and the in situ expressions of p-Akt and p-Bad were detected by flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The miR-320 expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS ED alleviated intestinal mucosal damage caused by burn injury, down-regulated the levels of MDA, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, but up-regulated the levels of TSH, SOD, CAT and Bcl-2. We also found that ED could reduce oxidative stress, inhibit cell apoptosis, increase the expressions of p-Akt, p-Bad and miR-320, and decrease PTEN expression. PTEN was predicted to be the target gene for miR-320, and cell apoptosis could be promoted by inhibiting miR-320 expression. CONCLUSION ED regulates Akt/Bad/Caspase signaling cascade to reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress through up-regulating miR-320 expression and down-regulating PTEN expression, thus protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier of rats from burn injury.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ke, Jiaxiang; Bian, Xi; Liu, Hu; Li, Bei; Huo, Ran","journal":"Molecular medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-019-0122-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PTEN","Akt/Bad/Caspase"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTEN expression","injury","burn model","intestinal mucosal barrier of rats","intestinal mucosal damage","Intestinal mucosa damage","p-Bad","Cell apoptosis","Akt","RESULTS ED","CONCLUSION ED","mortality of burn patients","protein relative expression","BACKGROUND Intestinal mucosa barrier dysfunction","cleaved caspase","situ expressions of p","colon mucosal damage index","SOD","levels of TSH","oxidative stress","levels of MDA","effect of edaravone","scrambled antagomir","contents of total sulfhydryl","free radical scavenger edaravone","total body surface area water","cascade","superoxide dismutase","flow cytometry","catalase","CMDI","hematoxylin-eosin staining","important factor","cytochrome C","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","Western blotting","immunohistochemistry","treatment","score","current study","malondialdehyde","Bcl","target gene","spectrophotometry","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We present a review of the current literature that details the potential negative consequences of COVID-19 positive donors. The factors we consider include: 1) the risk of blood transmission SARS-CoV-2, 2) involvement of donor organs, 3) lack of effective therapies, 4) exposure of healthcare and recovery teams, 5) disease transmission and propagation, and 6) hospital resource utilization. While we acknowledge that transplantation fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients, but also to the community and to healthcare workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies. For these reasons, we believe the evidence and risks show that COVID-19 infection should continue to remain a contraindication for donation, as has been the initial response of donation and transplantation societies.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Malay B; Lynch, Raymond J; El-Haddad, Hanine; Doby, Brianna; Brockmeier, Diane; Goldberg, David S","journal":"American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["utilization of COVID","exposure of healthcare","positive donors","healthcare workers","transplantation societies","present","potential negative consequences of COVID","strained healthcare resources","involvement of donor organs","lack of effective therapies","hospital resource utilization","risk of blood transmission SARS-CoV","disease transmission","curative therapies","perpetual scarcity of deceased donor organs","disrupted hospital functions","absence of effective preventative","initial response of donation","lives of transplant professionals","Kates et","society","recovery teams","current literature","need","propagation","viewpoint","selected cases","evidence","community","infection","risks","organ failure","unprecedented pandemic","United States","review","contraindication","recipients","reasons","factors"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A statewide multi-institutional collaborative for COVID-19 patients was utilized to obtain clinical data on the first 10 critically ill COVID-19 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS Of the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID-19, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men. Seven (70%) had comorbidities. The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset. None of the patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever \u2265103\u00B0F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%). All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X-rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia. All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration. Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course. One patient (10%) died after 9 days on ECMO from multiorgan dysfunction.

Their impact in liver surgery is poorly understood and approach-specific ERPs have not yet been assessed. This retrospective study aims to analyse the effect of such programs on liver resection. All patients undergoing liver resection at a tertiary referral centre between January 2009 and April 2019 were identified. Primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS), secondary outcomes were functional recovery, complications and readmission rates. Patients in the ERP with different protocols for open, laparoscopic, major and minor resections were compared to a historical cohort. Of 1056 patients, 644 were treated within the ERP. A comparable duration of hospital stay [7 days (IQR (interquartile range) 6-12) vs 7 days (IQR 5-9) p = 0.047] and faster functional recovery with fewer complications was found in the ERP group [94 (50.5%) vs 103 (35.9%) p \u003C 0.002].

Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raoofi, Azam; Takian, Amirhossein; Akbari Sari, Ali; Olyaeemanesh, Alireza; Haghighi, Hajar; Aarabi, Mohsen","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Iran"],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSION COVID","RESULTS Iran","hardest burden of COVID","unfolding outbreak","appropriate policies","policy learning","lenses of health policy triangle","contextual-based policies","recommendations of China","cases","countries","lifesaving medical equipment","public health concern","World Health Organization","protective equipment","inadequate lifesaving","government coalitions","global pandemic","appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration","double burden of political sanctions","professional advocacy attempts","delayed decisive governance","biggest challenges","systematic document content analysis","Spain","METHODS","Italy","medicines","article","society approach","novel coronavirus disease","efficient action","USA","total","Germany","experience","spread","deaths","emergency","virus entrance","Qom city","strategies","efforts","lives","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology. The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic. Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process. RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks. We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks. The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures. The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies. Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks. We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; Wu, Chen; Yang, Yue; Shen, Yang; Li, Jie; Lin, Kaicheng; Guo, Yi; Wei, Hongyun; Xu, Zeyu; Zhu, Hong","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["health economics researches","health economics research methods","outbreaks of communicable diseases","outbreaks of infectious diseases","health care workers","clinical research","RCTs","global health care systems","real-world data","communicable disease prevention","clinical data collection","case reports","effectiveness","real-world evidence studies","success of epidemic containment","important support","important value","relevant researches","evaluation methods","grave challenges","control strategies","coronavirus disease","potential challenges","control plan","intervention measures","gold standard","standard format","strict peer review process","early initiation of epidemiological","analysis","randomized controlled trials","study design","verification","safety","cases","response capacity","technical points","designated hospitals","style","setting of epidemics","opportunity","given treatment","pandemic","authors","patients","perspective of methodology","COVID","standards","feasibility","China"],"language":"en"},

Asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection. Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR\u002B yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections. We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR\u002B contacts of COVID-19 patients. Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days (range 1 to 29), and 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (p \u003C 0.05). Nine subjects (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others. Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential. Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR\u002B individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yubo; Tong, Jin; Qin, Yalan; Xie, Ting; Li, Jianghua; Li, Jianrong; Xiang, Jianhua; Cui, Yong; Higgs, Elizabeth S; Xiang, Jianglin; He, Yong","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic COVID","asymptomatic individuals","normal CT findings","days","normal chest CT findings","asymptomatic RT-PCR","abnormal findings","normal CT strata","contacts of COVID","abnormal chest CT scans","potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections","coronavirus disease COVID","clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV","close contacts of confirmed COVID","laboratory findings","patients","comorbidities","testing of traced contacts","mean cohort age","viral transmission","Mean time","disease progression","BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","demographics","cases","northeast Chongqing","median length of nucleic acid","diagnosis","index patient","impact of treatment","frequency","important source of infection","years","range","METHODS","factors","CONCLUSIONS","portion","Studies","discharge","people","RESULTS","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Biolubrication gets impaired due to diseases such as osteoarthritis, in which cartilage damage results from alterations in synovial fluid and lamina splendens composition. Osteoarthritis is treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) orally or via intra-articular injection, but due to the poor adsorption of HA on the cartilage surface in the absence of adhesive molecules, pain relief is temporary. Here, we describe how natural lubrication on degraded cartilage surface can be restored with the help of a bioinspired mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan catechol (Chi-C). Quartz crystal microbalance was used to mimic the formation of lamina splendens in vitro, known as synovial fluid conditioning films (SyCF), and colloidal probe atomic force microscopy was used to measure their nanoscale frictional properties. Clear evidence of glycoprotein (PRG4) recruitment by Chi-C increased the softness of SyCF, which also improved nanoscale lubrication in vitro, decreasing the friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.03. At the macroscale, cartilage damage induced by Chondroitinase ABC increased the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.07 \u00B1 0.04 (healthy tissue) to 0.15 \u00B1 0.03 (after tissue damage) in the presence of synovial fluid after sliding for 50 min. After Chi-C treatment of damaged cartilage, the COF fell to 0.06 \u00B1 0.03, which is comparable to healthy cartilage. Chi-C did not adversely affect the metabolic activity of human chondrocytes. This study provides new key insight into the potential for restoring biolubrication through the use of muco-adhesive molecules.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Hongping; Ren, Ke; Kaper, Hans J; Sharma, Prashant K","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

This scoping review examines the extent and range of research undertaken to evaluate behavioral interventions to support women of childbearing age to prevent and treat overweight and obesity. METHODS Eight electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) or systematic reviews of RCTs until 31st January 2018. Eligible studies included women of childbearing age (aged 15-44 years), evaluated interventions promoting behavior change related to diet or physical activity to achieve weight gain prevention, weight loss or maintenance and reported weight-related outcomes. RESULTS Ninety studies met the inclusion criteria (87 RCTs, 3 systematic reviews). Included studies were published from 1998 to 2018. The studies primarily focused on preventing excessive gestational weight gain (n = 46 RCTs, n = 2 systematic reviews), preventing postpartum weight retention (n = 18 RCTs) or a combination of the two (n = 14 RCTs, n = 1 systematic review). The RCTs predominantly evaluated interventions that aimed to change both diet and physical activity behaviors (n = 84) and were delivered in-person (n = 85). CONCLUSIONS This scoping review identified an increasing volume of research over time undertaken to support women of childbearing age to prevent and treat overweight and obesity. It highlights, however, that little research is being undertaken to support the young adult female population unrelated to pregnancy or preconception.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutchesson, Melinda J; de Jonge Mulock Houwer, Mette; Brown, Hannah M; Lim, Siew; Moran, Lisa J; Vincze, Lisa; Rollo, Megan E; Hollis, Jenna L","journal":"BMC women\u0027s health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-0882-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systematic reviews of RCTs","weight loss","weight gain prevention","BACKGROUND Women of childbearing age","excessive gestational weight gain","postpartum weight retention","reported weight-related outcomes","scoping review","Eligible studies","diet","behavioral interventions","range of research","little research","obesity","physical activity behaviors","increasing volume of research","maintenance","pregnancy","young adult female population unrelated","randomized controlled trials","time","electronic databases","inclusion criteria","preconception","extent","RESULTS","years","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","combination","person"],"language":"en"},

The disease usually manifests with ataxia, but previous reports suggested PRKCG variants in retinal pathology. To systematically investigate for the first time visual function and retinal morphology in patients with SCA-PRKCG. Seventeen patients with PRKCG variants and 17 healthy controls were prospectively recruited, of which 12 genetically confirmed SCA-PRKCG patients and 14 matched controls were analyzed. We enquired a structured history for visual symptoms. Vision-related quality of life was obtained with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) including the Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement (NOS). Participants underwent testing of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and retinal morphology with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measurements of the SCA-PRKCG group were analyzed for their association with clinical parameters (ataxia rating and disease duration). SCA-PRKCG patients rate their vision-related quality of life in NEI-VFQ significantly worse than controls. Furthermore, binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were worse in SCA-PRKCG patients compared with controls. Despite this, none of the OCT measurements differed between groups. NEI-VFQ and NOS composite scores were related to ataxia severity. Additionally, we describe one patient with a genetic variant of uncertain significance in the catalytic domain of PKC\u03B3 who, unlike all confirmed SCA-PRKCG, presented with a clinically silent epitheliopathy. SCA-PRKCG patients had reduced binocular vision and vision-related quality of life. Since no structural retinal damage was found, the pathomechanism of these findings remains unclear.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ihl, Thomas; Kadas, Ella M; Oberwahrenbrock, Timm; Endres, Matthias; Klockgether, Thomas; Schroeter, Jan; Brandt, Alexander U; Paul, Friedemann; Minnerop, Martina; Doss, Sarah; Schmitz-H\u00FCbsch, Tanja; Zimmermann, Hanna G","journal":"Cerebellum","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01130-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed SCA-PRKCG patients","SCA-PRKCG group","PRKCG variants","visual fields","visual symptoms","Vision-related quality of life","binocular visual acuity","retinal morphology","testing of visual acuity","time visual function","NEI-VFQ","binocular vision","retinal pathology","ataxia rating","ataxia severity","healthy controls","matched controls","contrast sensitivity","National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire","structural retinal damage","Spinocerebellar ataxia type","Measurements","disease duration","NOS composite scores","catalytic domain of PKC\u03B3","conventional mutations","association","clinical parameters","protein kinase C\u03B3","genetic variant of uncertain significance","previous reports","progressive disorder","optical coherence tomography","pathomechanism","Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement","structured history","Participants","SCA14","findings","silent epitheliopathy","groups"],"language":"en"},

For lesions adjacent to the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts, mapping can be done with both awake craniotomy (AC) and under general anesthesia (GA). OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine which anesthetic protocol-AC vs. GA-provides better patient outcomes by comparing EOR and postoperative morbidity for surgeries using IS mapping in gliomas located near or in motor areas of the brain. METHODS A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies from 1983 to 2019. Seven databases were screened. A total of 2351 glioma patients from 17 studies were analyzed. RESULTS A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a higher mean EOR in AC [90.1% (95% C.I. 85.8-93.8)] than with GA [81.7% (95% C.I. 72.4-89.7)] (p = 0.06). Neurological deficits were divided by timing and severity for analysis. There was no significant difference in early neurological deficits [20.9% (95% C.I. 4.1-45.0) vs. 25.4% (95% C.I. 13.6-39.2)] (p = 0.74), late neurological deficits [17.1% (95% C.I. 0.0-50.0) vs. 3.8% (95% C.I. 1.1-7.6)] (p = 0.06), or in non-severe [28.4% (95% C.I. 0.0-88.5) vs. 20.1% (95% C.I. 7.1-32.2)] (p = 0.72), and severe morbidity [2.6% (95% C.I. 0.0-15.5) vs. 4.5% (95% C.I. 1.1-9.6)] (p = 0.89) between patients who underwent AC versus GA, respectively.

However, the scarcity of training data for specific kinases makes it difficult to train effective models for predicting their phosphorylation sites. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework, PhosTransfer, for improving kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction. It banks on the hierarchical information encoded in the kinase classification tree (KCT) which involves four levels: kinase groups, families, subfamilies and protein kinases (PKs). With PhosTransfer, predictive models associated with tree nodes at higher levels, which are trained with more sufficient training data, can be transferred and reused as feature extractors for predictive models of tree nodes at a lower level. Out results indicate that models with deep transfer learning out-performed those without transfer learning for 73 out of 79 tested PKs. The positive effect of deep transfer learning is better demonstrated in the prediction of phosphosites for kinase nodes with less training data. These improved performances are further validated and explained by the visualisation of vector representations generated from hidden layers pre-trained at different KCT levels.

Earlier, Wotschke (1978) demonstrated that intersections of [Formula: see text] deterministic context-free languages are in general more powerful than intersections of d deterministic context-free languages for any positive integer d based on the hierarchy separation of Liu and Weiner (1973). The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke\u2019s result cannot be extended to disprove any other language to be written in the form of an intersection of d deterministic context-free languages. To deal with the non-membership of a wide range of languages, we circumvent their proof argument and instead devise a new, practical technical tool: a pumping lemma for finite unions of deterministic context-free languages. Since the family of deterministic context-free languages is closed under complementation, this pumping lemma enables us to show a non-membership relation of languages made up with finite intersections of even non-bounded languages as well.

This research aims to investigate the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, utilitarian and hedonic motivations on consumer intention to buy books online. It conceptualizes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as situational influences, which involve the closure of physical bookstores, health risks associated with visiting such stores, online shopping trend and additional marketing efforts from online bookstores during the pandemic. Data were collected from 275 Vietnamese consumers using an online survey. Multivariate data analysis reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic situation has a positive and significant impact on consumer intention toward online book shopping. Furthermore, while utilitarian motivation exerts a strong effect on consumer intention to purchase books online, the relationship between hedonic motivation and online purchase intention is positive but insignificant. These findings would assist key stakeholders such as publishers and online bookstores to improve the quality of their websites as well as develop their marketing campaigns.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Hoang Viet; Tran, Hiep Xuan; Van Huy, Le; Nguyen, Xuan Nhi; Do, Minh Thanh; Nguyen, Ninh","journal":"Pub Res Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c0bbd6df208d34f08723b13d1350505d428d47e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["online bookstores","online purchase intention","online survey","COVID","online shopping trend","online book shopping","consumer intention","pandemic situation","utilitarian motivation","closure of physical bookstores","hedonic motivations","significant impact","large impact","situational influences","marketing campaigns","additional marketing efforts","Multivariate data analysis","strong effect","health risks","relationship","key stakeholders","Vietnamese consumers","publishers","publishing industry","quality","findings","websites","coronavirus disease","effects","research"],"language":"en"},

The systematic study of these two features of social systems has started only very recently, mainly thanks to the development of multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic models unfolding at comparable timescale with respect to the evolution of the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic threshold as a function of the multiplexity and the features of each layer. We found that higher values of multiplexity significantly reduce the epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of nodes present on multiple layers are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics is driven by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the multiplexity. However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics is sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their effects on contagion phenomena.","publish_time":"2018-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Quan-Hui; Xiong, Xinyue; Zhang, Qian; Perra, Nicola","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/841c8ab46f0fbfab16d3b677a5003b20f94b8336.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219435.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219435/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","contagion dynamics","multiple layers","contagion phenomena","contagion processes","susceptible epidemic models","time-varying networks","complex temporal dynamics","time-varying model of multiplex networks","temporal nature of connectivity patterns","properties of real networks","development of multiplex","higher values of multiplexity","features of social systems","spreading dynamics","connected layer","systematic study","temporal activation patterns of nodes present","multiple contexts","susceptible-infected","average connectivity","Social interactions","comparable timescale","evolution","respect","effects","impact","single layered graph","characterization","function","step","disease","interplay","little overlap","end","thanks","limitation","characterizing","advancements","results","case"],"language":"en"},

However, as an essential component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 confers protective effects in physiological circumstance, including maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, fluid, and electrolyte balance. The absence of protective role of ACE2 leads to dysregulated RAS and thus acute changes under multiple pathological scenarios including SARS. This potentially shared mechanism may also be the molecular explanation for pathogenesis driven by SARS-CoV-2.

Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. RESULTS A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p\u003C0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. CONCLUSIONS In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with Covid-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was 45\u00B116 years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was 5.4\u00B12.2 days, and the second generation case was 6.7\u00B13.1 days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) . The most common basic disease was hypertension (13 cases, 9%), diabetes (9 cases, 6%), and the most common symptom is fever(142 cases, 95%, 63% showed moderate fever) , cough and sputum(108 cases,72%), fatigue(23 cases,15%), anorexia(20 cases, 13%), headache, diarrhea, muscle soreness, sore throat as the first symptoms. The average time from onset of symptoms to consultation was 4.2\u00B12.2 days for all patients. The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and eosinophilia (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and AST. High, very few patients have renal impairment. Among the inflammation-related indicators, the main manifestations are increased CRP (66 cases, 43%) and ESR (86 cases, 57%), elevated D-Dimer in 29% of patients. 144 cases have different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT examination, with 30 cases (21%) on one side and 144 cases (79%) on both sides. Morphologically, most of the lesions were patchy ground glass lesions, which could be accompanied by air bronchus signs and some consolidation and paving stone signs. Of the cases showing \u0022white lung\u0022, 87% were sever ill or critically ill. After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was 12\u00B14 days. Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases. The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, C; Zhang, X B; Dai, Y; Xu, X Z; Zhao, J","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200224-00168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALT","ESR"],"locations":["Nanyang City"],"keyphrases":["first-generation cases","ill patients","severe patients","days","clinical symptoms","clinical diagnosis","nCoV infection","clinical basis","clinical features","signs of pneumonia","onset of symptoms","moderate fever","eosinophilia","Nanyang City","common basic disease","chest CT examination","paving stone signs","air bronchus signs","average length of hospitalization","different degrees of infective lesions","epidemiological characteristics","patchy ground glass lesions","average time","median age","degraded hospitalization","degree of lymphocytopenia","increased CRP","common symptom","active treatment","history of epidemiological exposure","median incubation period","inflammation-related indicators","consolidation","main manifestations","atory","decreased WBC","diarrhea","muscle soreness","sore throat","designated hospitals","radiologic data","peripheral blood cells","lymphonpenia","headache","consultation","epidemiology","cough","sputum","evidence","hypertension","majority","liver function damage","myocardial enzymes","ALT","changes","women","Conclusion","LDH","Methods","elevated D-Dimer","lymphocyte count","renal impairment","years","Objective","severity","discharge standards","white lung","diabetes","fatigue","anorexia","ESR","AST","Results","sides"],"language":"en"},

In the context of rapidly changing conditions and incomplete data, this article outlines 3 important strategies to improve healthcare workers\u0027 respiratory protection. At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields. Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United States. We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for Italy also over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. CFRs vary from 0.7% in Germany and 1.6% in South Korea to 8.6% in Spain and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain\u0027s difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6% between March 9 and March 29, 2020, and more than 95% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of infected cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case fatality rates indicate the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dudel, Christian; Riffe, Tim; Acosta, Enrique; van Raalte, Alyson A.; Myrskyla, Mikko","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d906c6a23278fa3514ae0ba8918241cb1afbc02e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048397","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["France","Germany","United States","Spain","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["age-structure","age-specific case-fatality rates","age-specific case fatality rates","observed cases","infected cases","detected cases","confirmed cases","Italy","observed CFR","diagnosed infection cases","level differences","population-level case fatality rate","South Korea","diagnosed COVID","CFRs","Germany","countries","time","different testing regimes","latest data point","Spain\u0027s difference","better understanding of population","substantial proportion of cross-country variation","worsening health outcomes","extent","transmission trajectories","factors","France","death","China","unique contributions","designed seroprevalence studies","respect","key determinants","need","findings","support","recommendations","variables","demographic decomposition","United States","example","importance","change"],"language":"en"},

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc [\u2265]500 ms (if QRS \u003C120 ms) or QTc [\u2265]550 (if QRS [\u2265]120 ms) and b) increased QTc of [\u2265]60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{\u002B/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{\u002B/-}29 ms and increased to 459{\u002B/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{\u002B/-}43 ms vs -0.2{\u002B/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p\u003E0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{\u002B/-}39 vs. 0.5{\u002B/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions: Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients with these drugs should be carefully assessed prior to use.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramireddy, A.; Chugh, H.

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has relied on nucleic acid tests. However, there are many limitations of nucleic acid tests, including low throughput and high rates of false negatives. More sensitive and accurate tests to effectively identify infected patients are needed. METHODS: This study has developed fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) to determine IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The assay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals. Clinical specificity was evaluated by measuring 972 hospitalized patients with diseases other than COVID-19, and 586 donors of a normal population. Clinical sensitivity was assessed on 503 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 52 suspected cases. RESULTS: The assays demonstrated satisfied assay precision with coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 4.45%. Inactivation of specimen does not affect assay measurement. SARS-CoV-2 IgM shows clinical specificity of 97.33% and 99.49% for hospitalized patients and normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG shows clinical specificity of 97.43% and 99.15% for the hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG show clinical sensitivity of 85.88% and 96.62% respectively for confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection with RT-PCR, of 73.08% and 86.54% respectively for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: we have developed fully automated immunoassays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in human serum.

A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srinivasan, Shriya; Ramadi, Khalil B; Vicario, Francesco; Gwynne, Declan; Hayward, Alison; Langer, Robert; Frassica, Joseph J.; Baron, Rebecca M.; Traverso, Giovanni","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14e3db8a93cda4fc41707c0d4ce4acf53bf982e2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.012617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iSAVE","ventilator support","multiple patients","ill patients","ventilator demand","single ventilator","patient interdependencies","existing ventilators","jerry-rigged ventilators","respiratory circuit","Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy","additional ventilators","patient-specific volume","ventilation capacity of hospitals","acute respiratory distress syndrome","individualized controls","Individualized System","range of respiratory clinical states","conditions of ARDS","health systems","overwhelming healthcare systems","significant portion of COVID","pressure control","ICU","devices","pneumonia","protected air streams","safety features","cross-contamination","flow changes","intensive care unit","caregivers","shortages","pandemic","necessity","need","pig evaluation","human application","surge","inevitable mortality","off-the-shelf components","deployable platform","clinicians"],"language":"en"},

We have developed a fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic that has two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region (country, state, county, or city). These two parameters are calibrated to data from the community, so the model uncertainty depends on the quality of the data and ability to test for COVID-19. The model shows that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. The model predicts well the spreading trajectory and peak time of new infections for a community of any size and provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic. The theory has immediate and far-reaching applications for ongoing outbreaks or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, B.; Wang, Y.-M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d96339becc50bf064cfd3d5b272fa88703ff26f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081281v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social distancing","given community","model uncertainty","epidemic spread","community transmission rate","fundamental spreading model","COVID","data","parameters","peak time of new infections","similar future outbreaks","regulated growth phase","ongoing outbreaks","daily new infection rate","spreading trajectory","lead time","degree of isolation","natural exponential growth phase","total number of infections","far-reaching applications","region","state","country","weeks","metric","emergent infectious diseases","upper estimate","county","vital information","quality","size","phases","theory","novel coronavirus","ability","absence of intervention","city","curve"],"language":"en"},

We showed previously that healthy older humans (\u003E65 years old) have reduced antigen-specific cutaneous immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) antigen challenge. This was associated with p38 MAP kinase driven inflammation that was induced by mild tissue injury caused by the injection of the antigen itself. Here we show that non-specific injury induced by injection of air or saline into the skin of older adults recruits CCR2\u002BCD14\u002B monocytes by CCL2 produced by senescent fibroblasts. These monocytes reduced TRM proliferation via secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Pre-treatment with a p38-MAPK inhibitor (Losmapimod) in older adults in vivo significantly decreased CCL2 expression, recruitment of monocyte into the skin, COX2 expression and PGE2 production. This enhanced the VZV response in the skin. Therefore, local inflammation arising from interaction between senescent cells and monocytes leads to immune decline in the skin during ageing, a process that can be reversed. Summary Inflammation resulting from tissue injury blocks antigen-specific cutaneous immunity during ageing. Monocytes recruited to the skin inhibit TRM function through COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 production.

There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19 (on April 13, 2020): information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists.

Due to information borrowing across multiple countries, the proposed growth curve models provide a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. They outperform the existing individual country-based models. Additionally, we use countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories.

However, given Wuhan\u0027s connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menkir, Tigist Ferede; Chin, Taylor; Hay, James A; Surface, Erik; Martinez de Salazar, Pablo; Buckee, Caroline; Mina, Michael J; Khan, Kamran; Watts, Alexander; Lipsitch, Marc; Niehus, Rene","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad849bc77a6dd46077bfa57f4c95f0ee14b953e0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20038331","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lunar New Year"],"locations":["China","South Africa","Mauritania"],"keyphrases":["number of exported cases","predicted number of cases","large Chinese cities","city of Wuhan","effects of travel","early phase","case definition guidelines","recent travel history","flight travel data","early international case definitions","accurate travel history requirements","COVID","destinations","estimates of flight volume","initial phase","estimates of prevalence","epidemic advances","timing of Lunar New Year","issues","Egypt","South Africa","importance","accounting","exportations","mainland China","emergence of local transmission","health care systems","pandemic","locations","predictions","substantial risk of exportation","Wuhan\u0027s connectivity","potential outbreaks","countries","differences","lockdown","Mauritania","SARS-CoV","findings","trends","heterogeneities","surveillance"],"language":"en"},

It has created a perplexing situation about what actions one should and should not take. Mathematical modeling of biological systems is challenging and gives a different perspective, especially in decision making under multiple complex scenarios. Public health officials grapple with multiple issues such as recommending a lockdown, contact tracing, promoting the mask usage, social distancing, and frequent handwashing, as well as keeping the families of patients in isolation for the incubation period. It is even more challenging to find the optimal combination of all of the above without the use of a suitable mathematical model. There are many different approaches to modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some models are easy to use, while others need extensive use of high-end computers. However, models to assist public health official\u0027s decision making are hard to find. In this paper, we discuss a novel systems approach to building a model for simulating the spread of COVID-19. The model, MIMANSA, divides an individual\u0027s in-person social interactions into three areas, namely home, workplace, and public places. While tracking the in-person interactions, the model follows the virus spread. Internally, the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers, virus-infected patients, or healthy carriers. It tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction. As and when a new silent carrier is created, the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread. All single-day blocks are integrated to get the final result. MIMANSA is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel, integrated model, and in the end, enable one to make complex decisions with ease. MIMANSA is trained and validated using the data from the www.COVID-19India.org website. It does not use any arbitrary constants. All its parameters have a physical significance and are measurable. Once trained, the parameter estimation is complete, and the model is ready to run multiple scenarios. MIMANSA has four control mechanisms that a user can use. It helps one simulate the what-if scenarios. The first one is to control the exposure level to the virus depending on the number of hours spent with a silent carrier. The second provides control over the infection rate or the probability of a healthy person getting infected in the presence of a silent carrier. The third one allows the user to control lockdown effectiveness percentage, and the fourth one gives control over quarantine percentage. Inside the model, MIMANSA differentiates between virus-infected patients, silent carriers, and healthy carriers. MIMANSA has the capability to consider variations in virus activity levels of every asymptomatic patient, varying the exposure to the virus, and varying the infection rate depending on the person\u0027s immunity. MIMANSA can simulate scenarios to study the impact of many different conditions simultaneously. MIMANSA assists public health officials in complex decision making, enables scientists in projecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, and aids hospital administrators in management. MIMANSA will play a significant role in finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs. the marginally high number of COVID-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welling, A.

Methods Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]. By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs.

This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries. Methods An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population \u22651 million. Results Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the infections rate was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Conclusions Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayoub, Houssein H.; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Mumtaz, Ghina R.; Makhoul, Monia; Abu-Raddad, Laith J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dc5d7450361ed2fb3dba1553240a4e7e156aaee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20059253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["African Region"],"keyphrases":["median age","role of age","Conclusions Age","countries","younger age cohorts","epidemic trajectories","median R0","infections rate","driver of variable SARS-CoV","epidemic potential","years","pandemic","Results","death rate","critical disease cases rate","smaller children populations","elderly populations","rapid epidemics","slower epidemics","African Region","European Region","rates of disease severity","stark regional differences","Background Current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","deterministic mathematical model","differentials","mortality","sizable adult","transmission dynamics","distribution","absence of interventions","worst-case scenario","Methods","persons","heavy toll","study","heterogeneity","territories","complacency","predictions"],"language":"en"},

Methods: All close contacts of the patient were screened since the first supermarket employee with COVID-19 was identified. A retrospective analysis was made on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the confirmed cases admitted to the designated hospitals for centralized treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to the first generation (supermarket employees, group A) and the second or third generation (family members or friends of supermarket employees, group B), and the similarities and differences between the two groups were compared. Results: A total of 24 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed, with an average age of 48{\u002B/-}1.73 years. The mean duration from onset to release form quarantine was 21.04{\u002B/-}6.77 days, and the onset time was concentrated in 5-11 days after the first patient was diagnosed. Among all the patients, 23 patients were moderate, among which 7 patients (29.17%) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of symptomatic patients were cough (75.00%), low fever (62.50%), shortness of breath (41.67%), sore throat (25.00%), gastrointestinal symptoms (25.00%), fatigue (20.83%), etc. Biochemical examination on admission showed that the white blood cell count \u003C 4.010x9/L (29.17%) and the lymphocyte count \u003C1.1x109/L (58.33%). The lymphocyte count of 50.00% of the patients was [\u2264]0.6x109/L. On admission, chest CT showed pneumonia (100%) with bilateral infiltration (75.00%). Treatment: antiviral drug (100%), Chinese medicine (100%), common oxygen therapy (45.83%). There were 11 cases in group A (first generation, 11 cases) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases). In group B, there were more males, from onset to admission later, more patients had underlying diseases, and more patients were treated with albumin (P\u003C0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in other clinical indicators, including the duration from onset to release form quarantine(P\u003E0.05). There was no improvement in granulocyte count in all patients, as well as in groups A and B, between admission and release from quarantine(P\u003E0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster were similar to those of other COVID-19 patients, but there were some special features. The severity of the disease was similar and there was intergenerational spread. There was no difference in clinical characteristics between generations. Asymptomatic infections occurred in a proportion of patients and could cause spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, S.; Wu, M.; Chang, Z.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, G.; Zhang, W.; Xing, J.; Tian, H.; Zhang, X.; Zou, X.; Zhang, L.; Liu, M.; Chen, J.; Han, J.; Ning, K.; Chen, S.; Wu, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084e550529d93c2ade48cbac52d85daca81ef972.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.20058891v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proportion of patients","Symptoms of symptomatic patients","group B","intergenerational clinical characteristics of COVID","admission","groups","confirmed cases","control of COVID","clinical indicators","cluster","lymphocyte count","release","form quarantine","onset time","granulocyte count","friends of supermarket employees","intergenerational spread","days","white blood cell count","mean duration","centralized treatment","gastrointestinal symptoms","statistical difference","Asymptomatic infections","designated hospitals","family members","help","pneumonia","prevention","cough","outbreak","similarities","males","chest CT","underlying diseases","close contacts","010x9","improvement","generations","total","Conclusion","antiviral drug","Biochemical examination","common oxygen therapy","shortness of breath","sore throat","Chinese medicine","low fever","Methods","severity","retrospective analysis","differences","6x109","Results","1x109","albumin","rules","bilateral infiltration","average age","special features","fatigue","Objective","years"],"language":"en"},

Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses \u2013 the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again. In Brief The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982. Key Points RaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins. The sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient \u2018explorers\u2019 of phenotype space. The SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date. Non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods. We estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats. While an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Jiang, Xiaowei; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Perry, Blair; Castoe, Todd; Rambaut, Andrew; Robertson, David L","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52de003f4d3caafaf2db5c2aae87adb1da712a24.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of SARS","Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV","recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV","likely divergence date of SARS","SARS-related coronaviruses","bat viruses","MERS-CoV evolutionary rates","bat sarbecovirus reservoir","horseshoe bats","role of bats","role of recombination","sarbecovirus genome","viral emergence","Non-recombinant regions","frequent recombination","divergence date estimates","sarbecovirus subgenus","emergence event","effects of recombination","non-recombining regions","coronavirus evolutionary rates","non-recombining genome regions","significant coronavirus emergence","closest available bat virus","genome sarbecovirus alignment","divergence events","evolutionary history","pangolin viruses","available bat sequences","sub-lineage","reservoir species","recent recombinant","different methods","independent methods","phylogenetic methods","HPD","recombination-free alignments","outstanding evolutionary questions","virus diversity","Divergence dates","pattern of deep recombination events","diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses","Bayesian evolutionary rate","viral subgenus responsible","intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses","viral pool","new virus","humans","potential role","years","substantial genetic diversity","different prior specifications","Key Points RaTG13","prior information","genetic exchange","HCoV-OC43","high prevalence","zoonotic event","Malayan pangolins","phylogenetic inference","intermediate host responsible","cross species boundaries","high levels of co-infection","novel allele combinations","mammals","approaches","explorers\u2019 of phenotype space","rise","COVID","relevant evolution","spillover","Hubei province","occurrence","sister lineages","member","extent","relationship","decades","order","hosts","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV/r treatment (\u226410 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Dan; Liu, Xiao-yan; Zhu, Ya-nan; Huang, Li; Dan, Bi-tang; Zhang, Guo-jun; Gao, Yong-hua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e8df89ae8483ad09682ea77f013e9845253b57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lopinavir/Ritonavir","LPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["r treatment group","RNA shedding","prolonged viral shedding","lack of LPV","antiviral treatment","median duration of viral shedding","prolonged SARS-CoV","days","median duration of SARS","earlier administration of LPV","median age","RNA detection","infected patients","Older age","independent risk factors","symptom onset","multivariate logistic regression analysis","isolation wards","isolation precautions","decisions","Ritonavir","potential impact of Lopinavir","RT-PCR conversion","People\u0027s hospital of Hubei province","IQR","odd ratio","retrospective study","data","Conclusions","clinical features","studies","COVID","Background","confidence interval","Methods","years","Results"],"language":"en"},

Methods We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients based on these data. The clinical outcomes were compared among different clusters. Results Temporal analyses of laboratory results revealed that compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in the white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Using these results, we sub-classified the COVID-19 patients into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. We then reviewed the medical record of these patients and risk stratified them based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27.8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Conclusions There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza.

This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Veziant, J.; Bourdel, N.; Slim, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2208737020d0d2bcbb465b0b85db0cc6b4a8fee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20300954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20300954?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the protection","the pneumoperitoneum","mesures de protection","Abstract The Covid","precautions during the exsufflation","pneumoperitoneum with the virus present","HCPs","soignants","Protection measures include personal protection equipment","\u00E9quipements de protection individuelle","patients with Covid","This article analyses the risks","exsufflation du pneumop\u00E9ritoine","viral contamination","risques de contamination","obtaining pneumoperitoneum","a\u00E9rosolisation du pneumop\u00E9ritoine","extrapolation des mesures prises","risque de contamination virale","contamination among healthcare professionals","during laparoscopic surgery","adaptation de la technique chirurgicale","an extrapolation","surgical technique","patients atteints","pr\u00E9sence du virus","organisation de la salle","those taken during other epidemics","preferred intracorporeal anastomosis","aerosols from","filters","They must still be mandatory to","pandemic","filtres","m\u00E9thode de cr\u00E9ation","method","interventions laparoscopiques r\u00E9alis\u00E9es","anastomoses","pr\u00E9cautions","yet","markedly changed our practices","Harmful effects","quantified","\u00E9pid\u00E9mies","effet d\u00E9l\u00E9t\u00E8re","rigueur","op\u00E9ration","but","pand\u00E9mie","pratiques"],"language":"fr"},

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population. In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of Covid-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R_0). This also enables us to estimate the daily transmission rate ({beta}) that determines the effect of social distancing. We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on Covid-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 1.78. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from April 13 till 7 May 2020. The R_0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37, 2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below one. Also, the estimated fractional reported symptomatic cases are between 10 to 50%. Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adekunle, A.

To analyze the role of temperature, humidity, date of first case diagnosed (DFC) and the behavior of the growth-curve of cumulative frequency (CF) [number of days to rise (DCS) and reach the first 100 cases (D100), and the difference between them (\u0394DD)] with the doubling time (Td) of Covid-19 cases in 67 countries grouped by climate zone. Design. Retrospective incident case study. Setting. WHO based register of cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases. Participants. 1,706,914 subjects diagnosed between 12-29-2019 and 4-15-2020. Exposures. SARS-Cov-2 virus, ambient humidity, temperature and climate areas (temperate, tropical/subtropical). Main outcome measures. Comparison of DCS, D100, \u0394DD, DFC, humidity, temperature, Td for the first (Td10) and second (Td20) ten days of the CF growth-curve between countries according to climate zone, and identification of factors involved in Td, as well as predictors of CF using lineal regression models. Results. Td10 and Td20 were \u22653 days longer in tropical/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8[plusmn]1.2 vs. 5.7[plusmn]3.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6[plusmn]1.8 vs. 8.6[plusmn]4.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and \u0394DD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10\u003C2 and Td10\u003C3 in temperate and tropical/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20/Td10 \u003E2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berumen, Jaime; Schmulson, Max; Guerrero, Guadalupe; Barrera, Elizabeth; Larriva-Sahd, Jorge; Olaiz, Gustavo; Garcia-Leyva, Rebeca; Wong-Chew, Rosa M; Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Gallardo, Hector; Fajardo-Dolci, German; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31a8c61158e3d1c3c2dc4c0f1a16ca29deee4383.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070920v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCS","CF","DFC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Td10","CF growth-curve","DFC","CF variability","predictors of CF","subtropical countries","plusmn","climate areas","ambient temperature","temperate areas","\u0394DD","climate zone","larger Td","role of temperature","D100","fastest growth-curves","ambient humidity","number of days","remaining variability","identification of factors","environmental factors","best of cases","fold change Td20","r2","cumulative frequency","register of cumulative incidence of Covid","multivariate models","Comparison of DCS","lineal regression models","pandemic containment measures","Main outcome measures","Retrospective incident case study","virus","date","doubling time","earlier flattening","SARS-Cov","behavior","difference","Summary Objective","Design","Setting","Participants","subjects","Exposures","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically-significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other.

Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database).

I modeled the way the rate of increase y = ln(e^r - 1) has declined through time in each of the 51 states with the goal of determining how quickly the rate has declined, whether the decline has changed, and whether states differ. A piecewise linear regression was used, with a single break point. This model can identify whether there was a change in the rate of decline, when the change happened, and which states have shown the greatest improvement in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The piecewise model identified a significant breakpoint on 24 Mar for all states combined, and all states had nearly the same breakpoint. Prior to 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.013 per day, meaning a reduction in the rate of spread from 23.5% per day to 19.5% per day; after 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.070 per day, a reduction from 19.5% per day to 7.5% per day. Prior to 24 Mar there was no significant variation among states in the decline in y, but after 24 Mar there was substantial variation. Montana, Idaho, and Vermont showed the greatest improvement, while Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa the least. The improvement as measured by the reduction after 24 Mar did not correlate with case density in a state, nor state population. The next question is whether it correlates with differences among states in the health measures taken to combat the spread.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Condit, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081752v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["states","day","rate of decline","rate of increase y","rate r","decreasing rate","average change","reduction","greatest improvement","spread of COVID","significant breakpoint","significant variation","piecewise model","exponential increase","state population","substantial variation","piecewise linear regression","Nebraska","ln","South Dakota","differences","Vermont","health measures","Iowa","Idaho","way","case density","single break point","Montana","corona virus","goal","USA","question","time"],"language":"en"},

We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries and contrasted them with the overall population in the penitentiaries\u0027 respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality. Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from COVID-19 Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were women\u0027s prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population). Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blair, A.; Parnia, A.; Siddiqi, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/051393d8a4d503ec756419a8440ef64cc6fc68c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20086314v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Correctional Service of Canada"],"locations":["Quebec"],"keyphrases":["federal penitentiaries","overall population","following COVID","elevated COVID","total prison population","prevalence","Hardest hit penitentiaries","Data","Canadian general population average","universal testing","outcomes","known comprehensive analysis of COVID","fewer tests","women\u0027s prisons","cases","high levels of testing","federal penitentiary system","Female prisoners","Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub","potential release of prisoners","confined nature of prison populations","penitentiaries\u0027 respective provincial jurisdictions","rigorous infection prevention control practices","Quebec","sex-specific frequency statistics","Increased sentinel","province","Conclusion","British Columbia","Correctional Service of Canada","proportion","current outbreaks","Methods","date","fatality","Objectives","Results"],"language":"en"},

Obesity is a leading comorbidity in psoriatic disease, including both psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and is associated with adverse metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Anthropometric parameters, such as weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, have been extensively reported in psoriatic disease. However, the associations of body composition and fat distribution with psoriasis have not been fully defined. Objectives. To identify whether patients with psoriatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis, have altered body composition compared with the general population, and to review existing modalities for the assessment of body composition. Methods. Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register and Google Scholar. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results. Twenty-five full text articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final narrative analysis. The studies were of heterogeneous design and used a range of objective measures to assess body composition, including simple anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT). Few studies met all the quality assessment criteria. Conclusions. Patients with psoriatic disease reveal defined body composition changes that are independent of obesity and the customary metabolic syndrome, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia. These findings emphasize that patients with psoriatic disease should be screened for abnormal adipose effects beyond their weight and body mass index (BMI). Our findings show that the last decade has seen an exciting expansion of research interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition. There is no consensus on the optimal assessment method of body composition for this diverse group, hence there is a need for validation of existing modalities and standardization of assessment tools.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blake, T.; Gullick, N.

While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The estimates of the proposed approach are in good agreement with values of viral loads of well-known diseases from the literature. The quanta emission rates of an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subject, with a viral load in the mouth of 108 copies mL-1, were 10.5 quanta h-1 and 320 quanta h-1 for breathing and speaking respiratory activities, respectively, at rest.

The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and \u003E= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease-of-use IgG/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT-PCR. The combination of RT-PCR and IgG-IgM combined test kit could provide further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ying; Liu, Yueping; Diao, Bo; Ren, Feifei; Wang, Yue; Ding, Jinya; Huang, Qianchuan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0ffa99948917197e138fb6ff445b3c2003d3d90.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044883","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgG/IgM","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG-IgM test kit","IgG-IgM combined test kit","IgG-IgM combined antibody test","RT-PCR results","PCR positive group","PCR positive samples","SARS-CoV","PCR negative group","PCR negative sample","patients","nucleic acid RT-PCR","rapid IgG","accuracy","combination of RT","Positive predictive value","sensitivity","specificity","negative predictive value","study","diagnostic indexes evaluation","sample collection","disease subgroups","short turnaround time","Objective Coronavirus disease","corresponding nasal","specific requirements","pharyngeal swab specimens","suspected cases","data","additional equipment","skilled technicians","insight","illness onset","Kappa efficiency","need","critical subgroup","place of SARA","Abstract","total","infection diagnosis","complementary option","competence","mass testing","Methods","Conclusion","Serum","current stage","world","aim"],"language":"en"},

Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible. For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots. Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection \u0026 inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment \u0026 vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity \u0026 mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis \u0026 osteoarthritis patients alike. Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new avenues for infectious disease research. Availability www.zikaknowledgebase.eu Funding European Commission\u2019s Seventh Framework Research Programme project PREPARE (FP7-Health n\u00B0602525) and ZIKALLIANCE (MK, H2020; No 734548). Author summary During the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract information about host\u2013pathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological knowledge as a potential tool to support investigations during an emergency. This tool is contrasted with conventional approaches that would take months to comb through the massive amount of existing literature. In addition to providing background information for research, scientific publications can be processed to transform textual information into complex networks, which can be integrated with existing knowledge resources to suggest novel hypotheses that potentially contribute to innovative infectious disease research approaches. This study shows that the knowledge extraction and mapping process required to inform clinical and research responses to an emerging epidemic can be efficiently and effectively executed with a dedicated and trained group of experts, a validated process and the necessary tools. Our results further provide an overview of ZIKV biology, allow prediction of drug efficacy and indentify specific host factors and signalling pathways affected by ZIKV.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bauch, Angela; Pellet, Johann; Schleicher, Tina; Yu, Xiao; Gelemanovi\u0107, Andrea; Cristella, Cosimo; Fraaij, Pieter L.; Polasek, Ozren; Auffray, Charles; Maier, Dieter; Koopmans, Marion; de Jong, Menno D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7adfd2564c44a8e608f7da414db96e6c1e0a3aaa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","ZIKV","ZIKA KB","eu Funding European Commission","Seventh Framework Research Programme"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["knowledge gaps","integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge","existing knowledge resources","existing literature","knowledge management specialists","response of pathophysiological research","ZIKV research community","expert knowledge curation","concept knowledge repository","data integration","timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge","generic knowledge management software","resulting structured biological knowledge","innovative infectious disease research approaches","physiological data","literature mining","massive research response lead","little information","ZIKV infection","Zika virus","computational data analysis","rapid integration","background information","textual information","recent ZIKV outbreak","rapid response","available sources","Framework Research Programme project","use of automated literature analysis","additional curated data","initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase","evaluation of available evidence","comprehensive database available","conventional approaches","comprehensive molecular interaction","information-technology domains","severe infectious disease outbreaks","helpful tool","scientific publications","potential tool","host","months","described use case","pre-defined workflow","clinical management strategies","informed guidance of epidemic","high-quality evidence","pathogen interaction","novel hypotheses","case study","defined cooperative effort","number of relevant publications","short period of time","multi-disciplinary team of experts","quick compilation","generation of predictive models","steep increase","responses","Funding European Commission\u2019s","new avenues","clinicians","virologists","FP7-Health n","reproducibility","bioinformaticians","interactions","step-by-step guide","future threats","detailed online user manual","ZIKALLIANCE","Availability","patient outcomes","web interface","Author summary","epidemics","impact","organ pathways","investigations","complex networks","proof","S4","update","articles","MK","H2020","consequence","emergency","visualisation","Researchers","S5","weeks","process","validated process","mapping process","overview of ZIKV biology","specific host factors","prediction of drug efficacy","signalling pathways","trained group of experts","research responses","knowledge extraction","emerging epidemic","necessary tools","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries.

This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram.

In Part I, we begin by identifying a class of social processes which are simultaneously important in applications and difficult to predict using existing methods. It is shown that these processes can be modeled within a multi-scale, stochastic hybrid system framework that is sociologically sensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. Among other advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the appeal of a political movement) and the social dynamics which are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social process prediction.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies measuring the accuracy of the various tests are usually underpowered and inconsistent, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted the literature search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. For the statistical analysis we used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA) and the point-of-care (POC) Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA) that are based on immunochromatography. In total, we identified 38 eligible studies that include data from 7,848 individuals. The analyses showed that tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones, and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone. All methods yielded high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods performed better in terms of sensitivity (90-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 86%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. POC tests (LFIA), that are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies show high specificity but lower sensitivity and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kontou, Panagiota I; Braliou, Georgia G; Dimou, Niki L; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bagos, Pantelis G","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7cd33f182af02e02408bf4af35b5aad2eddf645.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20074914v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","Lateral Flow Immunoassays","IgG/IgM","FIA","POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELISA tests","IgG tests","POC tests","various tests","serological tests","N antigen-based tests","meta-analysis of diagnostic tests","comparison of different tests","LFIA","better sensitivity","terms of sensitivity","better choice","CLIA-based methods","IgM test","lower sensitivity","eligible studies","individual studies","large seroprevalence studies","Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays","Fluorescence Immunoassays","high specificity","statistical analysis","IgM ones","combined IgG","sensitivities","Lateral Flow Immunoassays","bivariate method","S antigen","safer choice","Nucleic Acid Test","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","care","PubMed","medRxiv","antibodies","point","accuracy","associated Coronavirus disease","literature search","systematic review","PRISMA guidelines","gold standard","COVID","bioRxiv","NAT","stage","data","samples","imperative need","specificities","antibody type","emergence of SARS","pandemic","total","individuals","analyses","account","levels","infection","onset of symptoms","immunochromatography"],"language":"en"},

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like COVID-19 is complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak. RESUMEN Objetivo: El brote de COVID-19 a finales de 2019 ha puesto los sistemas de salud de muchos pa\u00EDses al l\u00EDmite de su capacidad. Los pa\u00EDses europeos m\u00E1s afectados son, hasta ahora, Italia y Espa\u00F1a. En ambos (y en otros pa\u00EDses), las autoridades decretaron un confinamiento, con especificidades locales. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar el impacto de las medidas adoptadas en Espa\u00F1a para hacer frente a la pandemia.

There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake that\u0027s ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions.

A new strategy, coined a \u0022Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management\u0022, abbreviated MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model.

Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 \u00B1 15.0 years vs 48.9 \u00B1 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations.

Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cinesi G\u00F3mez, C.; Pe\u00F1uelas Rodr\u00EDguez, \u00D3.; Luj\u00E1n Torn\u00E9, M.l; Egea Santaolalla, C.; Masa Jim\u00E9nez, J.

According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some important locations, such as the substantia nigra and the choroid plexus. According to our cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain.

The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases. Conclusion: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zareie, Bushra; Roshani, Amin; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Rasouli, Mohammad Aziz; Moradi, Ghobad","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1fc44e3b0530a4db99203fe6359f9d714403c92.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAM"],"locations":["Iran","China"],"keyphrases":["number of Covid","parameters of time","time-dependent recovery rate","time-dependent mortality rate","epidemiological data of Iran","shortest time","dependent transmission rate","rapid spread of COVID","epidemiological analysis","China","epidemic peaks","public readiness","hospital readiness","outbreaks of disease","important point","number of patients","highest point","infected cases","government measures","timing","virus","increased awareness of effective interventions","R software","countries","social contact","mgcv package","average","people","Background","month","infections","SIR model","Findings","analyses","Conclusion","GAM models","week","results","study","purpose","Methods","prediction"],"language":"en"},

The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells. In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset. We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fodoulian, Leon; Tuberosa, Joel; Rossier, Daniel; Landis, Basile N.; Carleton, Alan; Rodriguez, Ivan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ab71bf1b90ae23b2104225817c97e6ad38c21f6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.013268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenic SARS-CoV","ciliated cells","target cells","sustentacular cells","infection","respiratory tissue","olfactory sensory epithelium","virus entry genes","integrity of olfactory sensory neurons","chemosensory tissue","respiratory tract","induced anosmia","RNA-seq libraries","TMPRSS2 serine protease","scRNA-seq dataset","significant expression of ACE2","prime candidate","external world","human neuroepithelium","direct contact","cellular membrane","viral Spike protein","angiotensin","specific cell types","binding","priming","targets","association","alteration","recent emergence","enzyme","possibility","various reports","nose","worldwide health crisis"],"language":"en"},

Methods Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (\u003E13%) black and all other (\u003C13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration.

In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Yaling; Tan, Mingkai; Chen, Xing; Liu, Yanxia; Huang, Jide; Ou, Jingyi; Deng, Xilong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7fb7c200fe40b5d47e805b31c62f124b60c319d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","elevation of IL","levels of IL","mild COVID","reliable indicators of severe COVID","immunopathological characteristics of COVID","B cells","NK cells","number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells","overall decline of lymphocytes","immune reactions","rise-decline","present study","comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes","cellularity of various immune cell types","cytokines important","CD4","CD8","pattern","inflammation","length of hospital","changes","contagious SARS-CoV","respiratory disorder","data","therapeutic effect","Coronavirus disease","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning. Objectives: To predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using machine learning and deploy the best performing algorithm as an open-source online prediction tool for decision-making. Materials and methods: Mortality for confirmed CoVID-19 patients (n=3,022) between January 20, 2020 and April 07, 2020 was predicted using five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosting). Performance of the algorithms was compared, and the best performing algorithm was deployed as an online prediction tool. Results: The gradient boosting algorithm was the best performer in terms of discrimination (area under ROC curve=0.966), calibration (Matthews Correlation Coefficient=0.656; Brier Score=0.013) and predictive ability (accuracy=0.987). The best performer algorithm (gradient boosting) was deployed as the online CoVID-19 Community Mortality Risk Prediction tool named CoCoMoRP (https://ashis-das.shinyapps.io/CoCoMoRP/). Conclusions: We describe the framework for the rapid development and deployment of an open-source machine learning tool to predict mortality risk among CoVID-19 confirmed patients using publicly available surveillance data.

A statistical analysis of currently available positive test frequency data reveals a surprisingly uniform relationship between the number of CoV-19 test performed and the number of positive tests obtained. The uniformity is particularly striking for United States CoV-19 test data.

Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country\u0027s hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical..

Respiratory syncytial virus is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection. Some other virus may be found during co-infections. The aim of this study was to search for biological markers correlated with gravity and risk factors for asthma and allergy. The follow up was done during the multicenter and prospective study Bronchiolitis (PHRC 2000 n\u00B0 2000/020/HP), performed between November 2001 and January 2006, which included seven centers in France: Rouen, Le Havre, Lille, Elbeuf, Evreux, Brest and Saint-Nazaire associated with Nantes. Clinical an biological data were gathered during initial course, then at one month and one year. For the population of 209 infants mean aged was 3 month, the gravity was evaluated by scoring. The laboratory results correlated with clinical scoring were the following: viral evaluation, absolute numbers of leucocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils, flow cytometry for sub-populations of lymphocytes, allergology including IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein, and basophil activation test. The results of the study are presented and discussed.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Legru, Emilie; Lees, Olivier; Bubenheim, Michael; Boyer, Olivier; Marguet, Christophe","journal":"Revue Francophone des Laboratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63eb6be2e20bba19ac0974b56ff282c64e2a1511.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773035X09716831; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773035X09716831","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Elbeuf"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rouen","Le Havre","Lille","\u00C9vreux","Brest","Nantes","France","Evreux"],"keyphrases":["the study","The results","The aim","the population","the gravity was evaluated","was done during the multicenter","The laboratory results correlated with clinical scoring were the following","Respiratory syncytial virus is the major cause","lymphocytes","virus respiratoire syncytial","\u00E9tude de cohorte","Clinical an biological","prospective study Bronchiolitis","biological markers correlated with gravity","this study was to search","lower respiratory tract infection","month","Brest","infection virale respiratoire \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","Saint-Nazaire associated with Nantes","\u00E9l\u00E9ments de gravit\u00E9","Rouen","Havre","Lille","Elbeuf","\u00E9valuation de la gravit\u00E9","mois","r\u00E9sultats suivants","\u00E9pisode de bronchiolite aigu\u00EB","PHRC","r\u00E9sultats de laboratoires","HP","Summary Acute bronchiolitis is an acute respiratory infection which commonly occurs in infancy","Some other virus may be found during co-infections","infants mean aged was","eosinophilic cationic protein","eosinophil cationic protein","basophil activation test","co-infections virales","cadre du protocole Bronchiolite","were gathered during initial course","num\u00E9ration des leucocytes","identification virale","asthme du nourrisson","which included seven centers in France","allergology including IgE","flux de populations lymphocytaires","marqueurs biologiques pr\u00E9dictifs","viral evaluation","then at","risk factors","January","absolute numbers","eosinophils","sub","flow cytometry","cytom\u00E9trie","\u00E9osinophiles","\u00C9vreux","Evreux","allergologie","asthma","seuls","agent infectieux","presented","performed between November","moyenne","\u00E9volution","association","hospitalisation initiale","visites suivantes","allergy","nourrissons \u00E2g\u00E9s","donn\u00E9es clinico","year","discussed","crit\u00E8res cliniques","travail","but","bronchiolites","centres"],"language":"fr"},

Each of these phases carries distinct risks that need identification and mitigation, forcing laboratory managers to rethink and adapt their procedures in response to the pandemic. The sudden and unprecedented nature of a pandemic forced lab managers from around the world to base decisions on personal opinion and experience when evidence-based response options were unavailable. These perspectives on pandemic response were presented during a virtual international symposium on Covid-19, held on 3 April, 2020, and organised by the London Laboratory Managers\u2019 Group. Laboratory managers from seven different countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy, Spain, France, UK, Brazil, Australia) presented their personal experiences to a select audience of experienced laboratory managers from 19 different countries. .

Design: Prospective, population-based epidemiological and Mendelian randomisation studies. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 377,143 self-identified British descent (54% women; median age 58 years) participants in the UK Biobank. Main outcome measures: First incident pneumonia over an average of 8 follow-up years. Results: 107,310 (30%) participants had hypertension at UK Biobank enrolment, and 9,969 (3%) developed a pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk for incident respiratory disease including pneumonia (hazard ratio 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.43), P\u003C0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure (1.43 (1.29 to 1.59), P\u003C0.001), and chronic lower respiratory disease (1.30 (1.25 to 1.36), P\u003C0.001), independent of age, age2, sex, smoking status, BMI, prevalent diabetes mellitus, prevalent coronary artery disease, and principal components of ancestry. Mendelian randomisation analyses indicated that genetic predisposition to a 5 mmHg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk of incident pneumonia for SBP (1.08, (1.04 to 1.13), P\u003C0.001) and DBP (1.11 (1.03 to 1.20), P=0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increase in blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second, forced vital capacity, and the ratio of the two (P\u003C0.001 for all). Conclusions: These results strongly suggest that elevated blood pressure independently increases risk for pneumonia and reduces pulmonary function. Maintaining adequate blood pressure control, in addition to other measures, may reduce risk for pneumonia.

However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them are still unknown. Methods: We collected data of 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the study hospital. The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases. Few of the study patients have developed complications during treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Jiaqiang; Fan, Shibing; Chen, Jing; Wu, Jianglin; Xu, Shunqing; Guo, Yuming; Li, Chunhui; Zhang, Xianxiang; Wu, Chuansha; Mou, Huaming; Song, Chenxi; Li, Feng; Wu, Guicheng; Zhang, Jingjing; Guo, Lian; Liu, Huawen; Lv, Jinglong; Xu, Lixin; Lang, Chunhui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed patients","study patients","Majority of patients","asymptomatic cases","young adult patients of COVID","severe cases","transmission","admission","treatment","family members","confirmed COVID","clinical characteristics","clinical data","days","family contactors","key epidemiological parameters","short serial interval","median serial interval","confidence interval","years","long incubation period","mean incubation period","young adults","key role","study hospital","ground-glass opacity","worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease","chest CT findings","common symptoms","dry cough","acute kidney injury","Background","Adolescents","Conclusions","demographics","complications","RESULTS","business","end","follow-up","Methods","male","fever"],"language":"en"},

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People\u0027s Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d069dfb7f0aefcdc2c890a1bbe773ebd26b01a55.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission","NCC"],"locations":["China","Hubei","Republic"],"keyphrases":["inflection peak time","infection peak time","peak infection time","peak numbers","inflection case peak time","ill patients","peak time of open inflection cases","Estimated time","number of severe","critical cases","cure rate","Hubei province","daily NCC decay rate","mortality rate","diagnosis rate","critical case distribution","Medical observation","medical resource allocation","medical conditions","critical case ratios","data resource","maximum open infection cases","continuous rising of infected cases","medical assistance systems","relative optimistic scenario","relative pessimistic scenario","critical care resources","Wuhan","death data","People\u0027s Republic of China","optimistic scenarios","patient distribution","public health decision","National Health Commission","state transition matrix model","overwhelming pressure","reasonable management of doctors","arrival","discharge","government","outbreak","subsequent days","transmission trend","novel coronavirus","nCoV","room","improvement","metrics","pneumonia","training set","tilt","Results","Methods","estimation","Background","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched databases for all case reports and series from February 12 to April 4, 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between December 8, 2019 and April 1, 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported. CONCLUSIONS Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaigham, Mehreen; Andersson, Ola","journal":"Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32259279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal mortality","maternal deaths","perinatal outcomes of COVID","severe maternal morbidity","neonatal morbidity","neonatal death","result of COVID","suspected COVID","clinical manifestations","neonatal mortality","SARS-CoV","neonatal infection","perinatal deaths","intrauterine death","poor outcomes","maternal intensive care unit admissions","intrauterine fetal death","pregnancy","case reports","Unpublished reports","vertical transmission","current study","major complications","pregnant women","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dual fluorescence PCR","suspicion of duplicate reporting","Careful monitoring of pregnancies","previous human coronavirus outbreaks","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","English","location","peer-reviewed publications","vulnerable populations","databases","fetuses","unspecified date","cases","unprecedented global health crisis","Eligibility criteria","pandemic","knowledge","measures","laboratory test","elevated C-reactive protein","METHODS","majority of mothers","series","articles","combinations","Multiple terms","fever","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIAL","trimester","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","cesarean section","coughing","Lymphocytopenia","objective"],"language":"en"},

This is particularly true in the field of neuro-oncology, where the perceived benefit of therapeutic interventions is often low, although this notion is partially incorrect. We acknowledge that the recommendations for care of patients with cancer have become a moving target and that all recommendations are subject to modification based on national and institutional regulations. Still, some important considerations and proposals may apply broadly. First, it is important to note that old age and cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidities are the major risk factors for experiencing a severe course of and for dying of COVID-19, not chronic immunosuppression and cancer. Second, many of the considerations on how we should adapt clinical practice in neuro-oncology in view of COVID-19 that are now dominating discussions at local tumour boards, as well as on the institutional level and within societies of neuro-oncology, are not novel but have been valid before and only now have become a priority. More than ever, it seems to be mandatory to adhere to evidence-based medicine and not to prescribe potentially toxic, notably immunsuppresssive systemic therapy where evidence for efficacy is low. Furthermore, it is more obvious now that oncologists must not miss the right time for advance care planning, that is, supporting patients in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care. The major psychological impact of transforming oncology care to teleconferences and videoconferences and of the important strict recommendation of social distancing must not be overlooked in a patient population that is characterised by significant prevalence of cognitive decline and by the general perception that their life span may not exceed the life span of the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weller, Michael; Preusser, Matthias","journal":"ESMO open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care of patients","neuro-oncology","cancer","major psychological impact of transforming oncology care","life span","view of COVID","important considerations","future medical care","advance care planning","life goals","societies of neuro","field of neuro","major insecurities","recommendations","pandemic","major risk factors","evidence-based medicine","institutional regulations","institutional level","important strict recommendation of social distancing","pulmonary co-morbidities","preferences","treatment","access","videoconferences","old age","personal values","immunsuppresssive systemic therapy","modification","efficacy","right time","general perception","significant prevalence of cognitive decline","perceived benefit of therapeutic interventions","current standards of diagnosis","severe course","moving target","clinical practice","discussions","local tumour boards","oncologists","understanding","chronic immunosuppression","patient population","notion","proposals","priority"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. PARTICIPANTS 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (RE ) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. RESULTS As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in RE were identified over the study period within each region. CONCLUSIONS Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high. Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewnard, Joseph A; Liu, Vincent X; Jackson, Michael L; Schmidt, Mark A; Jewell, Britta L; Flores, Jean P; Jentz, Chris; Northrup, Graham R; Mahmud, Ayesha; Reingold, Arthur L; Petersen, Maya; Jewell, Nicholas P; Young, Scott; Bellows, Jim","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kaiser Permanente","ICU"],"locations":["United States","Washington","California"],"keyphrases":["acute hospital admission","duration of hospital","days","northern California","southern California","long hospital","incomplete hospital","probabilities of ICU admission","residents of California","median duration of ICU stay","Analyses of hospital length","confirmed covid","female patients","censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission","subsequent probabilities of admission","Washington state","Incidence rates of new hospital admissions","female inpatients","estimated median duration","Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans","mortality risk","people","region","confidence interval","healthcare plan enrollees","SETTING Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems","censoring adjusted case fatality ratio","critical care","cumulative incidences","non-survivors","cohort members","DESIGN Prospective cohort study","study period","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative incidence","intensive care unit","populations","age","west coast","conjunction","epidemiology","burden of severe coronavirus disease","implementation of social distancing interventions","clinical outcomes","transmission dynamics","effective reproduction number","epidemic wave","United States","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","PARTICIPANTS","Accounting","RESULTS","Reductions"],"language":"en"},

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model. METHODS Trastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100 \u03BCg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48 h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal. RESULTS Based on the biodistribution data, a 30 \u03BCg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 \u00B1 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 \u00B1 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 \u00B1 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression. CONCLUSIONS Dual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deken, Marion M; Bos, Desir\u00E9e L; Tummers, Willemieke S F J; March, Taryn L; van de Velde, Cornelis J H; Rijpkema, Mark; Vahrmeijer, Alexander L","journal":"EJNMMI research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-019-0564-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31754913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HER2-positive tumors","DTPA-trastuzumab","orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors","multimodal imaging of HER2","orthotopic low HER2","orthotopic high HER2","feasibility of HER2","orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors","fluorescence imaging","high HER2 expression","METHODS Trastuzumab","fluorescence image-guided surgery","image-guided resection","enabled image-guided tumor resection","CT imaging","multimodal image-guided surgery","intraoperative tumor localization","MCF7 tumor","complete tumor resection","positive breast cancer","fluorescence microscopy","orthotopic breast cancer model","radical resection of tumor tissue","Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors","co-localization of tumor tissue","targeted multimodal imaging","biodistribution study","IRDye800CW-NHS ester","\u03BCg dose of dual","micro-SPECT","intraoperative localization","CONCLUSIONS Dual","radiosignal","biodistribution data","dose escalation study","preoperative detection","p-isothiocyanatobenzyl","c nude mice","specific accumulation","patients","gamma probe","BALB","injection","human epidermal growth factor","correspondence","monoclonal antibody","ITC","diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid","antibodies","uptake","stained slices","addition","receptor","modalities","fluorophore","radioactive label","blood ratio","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Autoradiography","group","subsequent studies","clinical setting","aim"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.

To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. METHODS We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4-week at home. The patient\u0027s daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 - 44 days with an average of 25 \u00B1 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 - 14 days after discharge. The rate of a recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31%(4/13). CONCLUSION Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicate potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow-up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid. This article is protected by copyright.

The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. METHODS Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. RESULTS All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (\u003C1.0 \u00D7 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. CONCLUSIONS The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation. Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.

METHODS We reviewed the medical charts of four cases of corneal endotheliitis that were CMV-positive. We have classified types of clinical phenomenon into four types: coin-shaped KPs, sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs, mutton-fat KPs, and fine KPs and have graded their severity. We also determined the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV in the aqueous humor by real-time polymerase chain reaction before and during the treatment. We evaluated the correlation between the patterns of clinical characteristics and copy number of the DNA of CMV. RESULTS There were clinical improvements in all eyes following topical ganciclovir in conjunction with low dose of topical steroid treatment, with or without oral valganciclovir. The clinical characteristics and the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV varied during the treatment period. The presence of coin-shaped KPs was correlated with high copy numbers (105-103 copies/ml) of the DNA of CMV. The copy numbers of the DNA of CMV with sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs ranged from 104 to 102 copies/ml, and it was occasionally accompanied by high intraocular pressure. Mutton-fat KPs were observed inferiorly, sometimes together with coin-shaped KPs and sectoral corneal edema, or solely. The copy numbers in eyes with mutton-fat KPs varied and occasionally less than the cutoff level. Fine-pigmented KPs were observed after the resolution of the endotheliitis, and no DNA of CMV was detected in the aqueous humor. CONCLUSIONS Careful observations of the clinical characteristics such as the KPs and corneal edema might be helpful in estimating the amount of the DNA of CMV in eyes with corneal endotheliitis.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshimura, Ayano; Araki-Sasaki, Kaoru; Toyokawa, Noriko; Fujiwara, Rho; Jho, Nobuo; Gomi, Fumi","journal":"International ophthalmology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01412-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA of CMV","CMV corneal endotheliitis","fine KPs","coin-shaped KPs","mutton-fat KPs","CMV-positive","high copy numbers","sectoral corneal edema","Fine-pigmented KPs","DNA of cytomegalovirus","eyes","cases of corneal endotheliitis","patterns of clinical characteristics","types of clinical phenomenon","clinical improvements","clinicals characteristics","Khodadoust line","aqueous humor","presence of coin","treatment period","correlation","copies","low dose of topical steroid treatment","topical ganciclovir","various types of keratic precipitates","high intraocular pressure","conjunction","real-time polymerase chain reaction","medical charts","CONCLUSIONS Careful observations","resolution","oral valganciclovir","METHODS","RESULTS","severity","cutoff level","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to compare outcomes of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) vs. open total gastrectomy (OTG) for gastric adenocarcinoma using a national cancer database. METHODS The National Cancer Database (2010-2014) was analyzed for total gastrectomy cases performed for gastric adenocarcinoma. Patient demographics and surgical outcomes were stratified by stage and compared based on laparoscopic vs. open surgical approach. Primary outcome measures included 30-day and 90-day mortality and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate long-term survival. RESULTS There were 2584 cases analyzed, including 592 (22.9%) stage I, 710 (27.5%) stage II, and 1282 (49.6%) stage III cases. The distribution of LTG vs. OTG cases was 156 (26.4%) vs. 436 (73.6%) for stage I, 163 (23.0%) vs. 547 (77.0%) for stage II, and 241 (18.8%) vs. 1041 (81.2%) for stage III.

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with \u003E2.6 million confirmed infections and \u003E183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag time-for example, 23 days-there could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duarte\u0027s elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to \u003E1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above. In summary, 2 different approaches indicated similar ranges of undetected infections in North America. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level V.

We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19. Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care. Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas. Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.

Estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for HTNT and FFN assays derived from receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that both PEDV FFN and HTNT provided excellent diagnostic performance.

The majority of COVID-19 patients are with mild syndromes. This study aimed to develop models for predicting disease progression in mild cases. METHODS The risk factors for the requirement of oxygen support in mild COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression. Nomogram as visualization of the models was developed using R software. RESULTS A total of 344 patients with mild COVID-19 were included in the final analysis, 45 of whom progressed and needed high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation after admission. There were 188 (54.7%) males, and the average age of the cohort was 52.9 \u00B1 16.8 years. When the laboratory data were not included in multivariate analysis, diabetes, coronary heart disease, T \u003E=38.5\u2103 and sputum were independent risk factors of progressive COVID-19 (Model 1). When the blood routine test was included the CHD, T \u003E=38.5\u2103 and NLR were found to be independent predictors (Model 2). The AUROC of model 2 was larger than model 1 (0.872 vs. 0.849, P =0.023). The negative predictive value of both models was greater than 96%, indicating they could serve as simple tools for ruling out the possibility of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, two models comprised common symptoms (fever and sputum), underlying diseases (diabetes and coronary heart disease) and blood routine test are developed for predicting the future requirement of oxygen support in mild COVID-19 cases.

Early studies suggested that ketamine could increase the intracranial pressure thus lowering the cerebral perfusion and hence reduce the oxygen supply to the injured brain. However, more recent studies are less conclusive and might even indicate that patients with acute brain injury could benefit from ketamine sedation. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding the use of ketamine in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. Databases were searched for studies using ketamine in acute brain injury. Outcomes of interest were mortality, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, blood pressure, heart rate, spreading depolarizations, and neurological function. In total 11 studies were included. The overall level of evidence concerning the use of ketamine in brain injury is low. Only two studies found a small increase in intracranial pressure, while two small studies found decreased levels of intracranial pressure following ketamine administration. We found no evidence of harm during ketamine use in patients suffering from acute brain injury.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gregers, Mads Christian Tofte; Mikkelsen, S\u00F8ren; Lindvig, Katrine Prier; Br\u00F8chner, Anne Craveiro","journal":"Neurocritical care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-00975-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of ketamine","ketamine use","acute brain injury","traumatic brain injury","ketamine administration","ketamine sedation","cerebral perfusion pressure","patients","injured brain","small studies","blood pressure","recent studies","Early studies","decreased levels of intracranial pressure","cerebral circulation","evidence of harm","small increase","overall level of evidence","heart rate","depolarizations","mortality","anesthetic","oxygen supply","possible deleterious effects","neurological function","systematic review","Outcomes","years","Databases"],"language":"en"},

There is no sterilizing cure, therefore a continuous treatment is necessary, which caused the emerged idea of HIV as a chronic inflammatory disease that may also affect healthy aging. Considering that the activation profile of some innate cells such as natural killer cells has previously been associated to HIV progression, it remains to be better defined this activation status of NK cells considering the time of HIV infection. In this study, we characterized NK cell phenotype and function during acute and chronic HIV infection and also investigated markers of immunosenescence in these cells. Our results showed that chronic infected patients remained with elevated levels of some plasma inflammatory molecules (IP-10, sCD14) and a concurrent expansion of the non-functional NK cell subset (CD3-CD56-CD16\u002B). NK cells from the chronic infected group displayed an activated profile with higher levels of cytokines and chemokines production (TNF-\u03B1, IL-12, IFN-\u03B12, IFN-\u03B3, IL-6, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5). The production of these molecules was positively correlated to the time of infection. Moreover, we noted a possible association of higher global DNA methylation frequency of NK cells in two HIV patients in the advanced stage of disease. Chronic infected patients also showed a trend towards higher production of reactive oxygen species by their NK cells which altogether suggest the evolution of these cells to a senescent state that might be further evaluated.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soares, Luana Silva; Esp\u00EDndola, Milena Sobral; Zambuzi, Fabiana Albani; Galv\u00E3o-Lima, Leonardo Judson; Cacemiro, Maira Costa; Soares, Murilo Racy; Santana, B\u00E1rbara A; Calado, Rodrigo T; Bollela, Valdes Roberto; Frantz, Fabiani Gai","journal":"International immunopharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","NK","IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic HIV infection","innate cells","HIV patients","activation status of NK cells","chronic infected patients","time of HIV infection","HIV progression","natural killer cells","NK cell phenotype","chronic infected group","chronic inflammatory disease","possible association of higher global DNA methylation frequency of NK cells","emerged idea of HIV","non-functional NK cell subset","time of infection","higher levels of cytokines","chemokines production","activation profile","higher production of reactive oxygen species","plasma inflammatory molecules","elevated levels","activated profile","IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B12","advanced stage of disease","important global health issue","trend","CD3-CD56","concurrent expansion","TNF-\u03B1","AIDS pandemic","continuous treatment","sCD14","IP","RANTES","markers of immunosenescence","evolution","sterilizing cure","CD16","study","MCP","results","healthy aging","senescent state"],"language":"en"},

Overweight and obesity are related to a later, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Increasing weight between pregnancies has a negative impact on the development of the fetus in a subsequent pregnancy. It is also related to long-term obesity and overweight for the woman. Accordingly, weight control in women of the childbearing age is important for both women and their offspring. Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an integrated part of many peoples\u0027 lives, and it has the potential to prevent disease. In this systematic review, we summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials to compare effects of different ICT-based interventions to support postpartum women to achieve weight loss. METHODS A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane, searching on terms, such as postpartum, weight loss, telemedicine, and randomized controlled trials. Two independent researchers undertook study selection and data extraction. Results were reported narratively. The systematic review only included studies that were randomized controlled trials. RESULTS Eight studies were included in the systematic review. All of them were characterized by applying one or more ICT components to assist postpartum women in weight control, and had weight loss as an outcome measure. A significant difference was found in weight loss between control group and intervention group in the majority of the studies. However, five of the studies had a relatively short follow-up period (40 days to 16 weeks), six of the studies had a relatively small sample size (18 to 66 women), and half of the studies indicated challenges with adherence to the interventions over time. CONCLUSION ICT-based interventions can support postpartum women to achieve a healthy lifestyle and weight control. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and adherence to the interventions.

The data from January 20, 2020 to February 7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12 were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the fitting bias of SEIR(\u002B CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was less than 5%.

METHODS We conducted a web-based survey sent electronically to 21 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited IC fellowship program directors (PDs) and their respective fellows. RESULTS Fourteen programs (67%) responded to the survey and all acknowledged a significant decrease in CCL procedural volumes. More than half of the PDs reported part of their CCL being converted to inpatient units and IC fellows being redeployed to COVID-19 related duties. More than two-thirds of PDs believed that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a moderate (57%) or severe (14%) adverse impact on IC fellowship training, and 21% of the PDs expected their current fellows\u0027 average percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume to be below 250. Of 25 IC fellow respondents, 95% expressed concern that the pandemic would have a moderate (72%) or severe (24%) adverse impact on their fellowship training, and nearly one-fourth of fellows reported performing fewer than 250 PCIs as of March 1st. Finally, roughly one-third of PDs and IC fellows felt that there should be consideration of an extension of fellowship training or a period of early career mentorship after fellowship. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in CCL procedural volumes that is impacting IC fellowship training in the NY metropolitan area. These results should inform professional societies and accreditation bodies to offer tailored opportunities for remediation of affected trainees.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Tanush; Nazif, Tamim M; Vahl, Torsten P; Ahmad, Hasan; Bortnick, Anna E; Feit, Frederick; Jauhar, Rajiv; Kandov, Ruben; Kim, Michael; Kini, Annapoorna; Lawson, William; Leber, Robert; Lee, Alexander; Moreyra, Abel E; Minutello, Robert M; Sacchi, Terrence; Vaidya, Pranaychan J; Leon, Martin B; Parikh, Sahil A; Kirtane, Ajay J; Kodali, Susheel","journal":"Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography \u0026 Interventions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Accreditation Council","Graduate Medical Education","IC","CCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IC fellowship training","extension of fellowship training","pandemic","COVID","CCL procedural volumes","IC fellow respondents","thirds of PDs","Graduate Medical Education accredited IC fellowship program directors","adverse impact","respective fellows","significant reduction","RESULTS","NY metropolitan area","Accreditation Council","accreditation bodies","marked reduction","significant decrease","New York Metropolitan area","web-based survey","current fellows\u0027 average percutaneous coronary intervention","tailored opportunities","cardiac catheterization laboratory","period of early career mentorship","interventional cardiology","potential","postponement of elective procedures","professional societies","remediation of affected trainees","healthcare burden","coronavirus disease","inpatient units","consideration","performing fewer","PCIs","concern","METHODS","BACKGROUND","related duties","CONCLUSIONS","programs","half"],"language":"en"},

Parents are primary gatekeepers to children\u0027s food intake; however, reaching and engaging parents in nutrition promotion can be challenging. With growth in internet and smartphone use, digital platforms provide potential to disseminate information rapidly to many people. The objectives of this review were to conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of nutrition promotion via websites and apps supporting parents to influence children\u0027s nutrition, from three different perspectives: 1) current evidence base, 2) end user (parent) experience and 3) current commercial offerings. METHODS Three systematic reviews were undertaken of (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness for digital platforms for improving nutrition in children and parents, (2) studies conducting user-testing of digital tools with parents, (3) websites and apps providing lunch-provision information to parents. Searches were conducted in five databases for reviews one and two, and systematic search of Google and App Store for review three. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional and qualitative studies (study two only) were included if published in English, from 2013, with the intervention targeted at parents and at least 50% of intervention content focused on nutrition. Search results were double screened, with data extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality appraisal of included search results. RESULTS Studies evaluating digital nutrition interventions targeting parents (n = 11) demonstrated effectiveness for improving nutrition outcomes, self-efficacy and knowledge. Six of the included randomised controlled trials reported digital interventions to be equal to, or better than comparison groups. User-testing studies (n = 9) identified that digital platforms should include both informative content and interactive features. Parents wanted evidence-based information from credible sources, practical tools, engaging content and connection with other users and health professionals. Websites targeting lunch provision (n = 15) were developed primarily by credible sources and included information-based content consistent with dietary guidelines and limited interactive features. Lunchbox apps (n = 6), developed mostly by commercial organisations, were more interactive but provided less credible information. CONCLUSIONS Digital nutrition promotion interventions targeting parents can be effective for improving nutrition-related outcomes in children and parents. As demonstrated from the lunchbox context and user-testing with parents, they need to go beyond just providing information about positive dietary changes, to include the user-desired features supporting interactivity and personalisation.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zarnowiecki, Dorota; Mauch, Chelsea E; Middleton, Georgia; Matwiejczyk, Louisa; Watson, Wendy L; Dibbs, Jane; Dessaix, Anita; Golley, Rebecca K","journal":"The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-0915-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["engaging parents","digital nutrition interventions","children\u0027s nutrition","nutrition outcomes","digital interventions","digital platforms","CONCLUSIONS Digital nutrition promotion interventions","digital tools","credible information","User-testing studies","nutrition-related outcomes","systematic evaluation of nutrition promotion","RESULTS Studies","evidence-based information","lunch-provision information","information-based content consistent","engaging content","end user","websites","user-desired features","intervention content","qualitative studies","quality appraisal of included search results","informative content","credible sources","included randomised controlled trials","Lunchbox apps","systematic reviews","systematic search of Google","limited interactive features","children\u0027s diet quality","lunch provision","effectiveness","current evidence base","children\u0027s food intake","current commercial offerings","dietary guidelines","practical tools","lunchbox context","commercial organisations","positive dietary changes","connection","standardised spreadsheets","experience","smartphone use","cohort","different perspectives","users","App Store","internet","primary gatekeepers","self-efficacy","BACKGROUND","interactivity","knowledge","health professionals","growth","personalisation","study","databases","METHODS","comparison groups","Searches","objectives","people","English"],"language":"en"},

All values of corneal curvatures (K1, K2, Kmean) in 3 mm, 5 mm, and 7 mm zones were found statistically significantly higher in the RA group compared with the control group. Forty-five RA patients had a dry eye. Disease duration was correlated with dry eye in the RA group. There was a significant correlation between the duration of disease in RA patients and mean corneal curvatures (p 0.012/0.010/0.007, 3/5/7 mm respectively) and central corneal thickness (p 0.025).

However, there is no analysis that measures the potential magnitude of the problem or proposes a solution. In this paper, I combine the pandemic forecasting model used by the federal government with estimates of ventilator availability from the literature to assess the expected shortage under various scenarios. I then propose that the federal government organize a national effort for ventilators to be exchanged between states to take advantage of the inter-temporal differences in demand peaks. I evaluate versions of this proposal, including use of the national stockpile, to estimate the number of lives that could be saved, and observe that it is potentially substantial.

As the number of peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions grows, it is important to gain insight into the different designs of groups available, who is accessing them, if and how they may be effective, and what strategies are being used to implement or increase consumer engagement. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this systematic review of people with musculoskeletal conditions were to (1) describe the design features (functions, usage options, moderation, and expert input) of peer-to-peer OSGs, (2) describe the characteristics of the individuals using peer-to-peer OSGs, (3) synthesize the evidence on outcomes of participation, and (4) identify strategies used in the delivery and maintenance of OSGs. METHODS A search comprising terms related to the population (people with musculoskeletal disorders) and the intervention (peer-to-peer OSGs) was conducted in 6 databases. Results were filtered from 1990 (internet inception) to February 2019. Studies identified in the search were screened according to predefined eligibility criteria using a 2-step process. Quantitative studies were appraised by 2 reviewers using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Qualitative studies were appraised by 2 different reviewers using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Extracted data were synthesized narratively. RESULTS We examined 21 studies with low to moderate risk of bias. Of these studies, 13 studies included OSGs hosted on public platforms, 11 studies examined OSGs that were conducted in English, and 6 studies used moderators or peer leaders to facilitate engagement. Studies either reported the number of OSG members (n=1985 across all studies) or the number of posts (range: 223-200,000). The majority of OSG members were females who were not full-time employees and with varied levels of education. There were no randomized controlled trials measuring the efficacy of OSGs. Qualitative and quantitative studies identified empowerment, social support, self-management behavior, and health literacy as primary constructs to measure OSG efficacy. Neutral or marginal improvement was reported in these constructs. Sharing experiences and a greater level of engagement appeared to have an important influence on OSGs efficacy. The extent to which members posted on the website influenced engagement. CONCLUSIONS Across a diverse range of designs, languages, included features, and delivery platforms, peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions attract predominantly female participants of all ages and education levels. The level of participation of a member appears to be related to their perceived benefit, health literacy, and empowerment. Future studies are needed to identify which design and maintenance strategies have superior efficacy and whether there are concomitant improvements in health outcomes for people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions resulting from participation in OSGs.

Strategies delivered by means of information and communication technologies (ie, eHealth) can address treatment adherence through patient education, real-time monitoring of apnea symptoms and CPAP adherence in daily life, self-management, and early identification and subsequent intervention when device or treatment problems arise. However, the effectiveness of available eHealth technologies in improving CPAP adherence has not yet been systematically studied. OBJECTIVE This meta-analytic review was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a broad range of eHealth interventions in improving CPAP treatment adherence. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search of the databases of Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase to identify relevant randomized controlled trials in adult OSA populations. The risk of bias in included studies was examined using seven items of the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. The meta-analysis was conducted with comprehensive meta-analysis software that computed differences in mean postintervention adherence (MD), which was defined as the average number of nightly hours of CPAP use. RESULTS The meta-analysis ultimately included 18 studies (N=5429 adults with OSA) comprising 22 comparisons between experimental and control conditions. Postintervention data were assessed at 1 to 6 months after baseline, depending on the length of the experimental intervention. eHealth interventions increased the average nightly use of CPAP in hours as compared with care as usual (MD=0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.79). Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences in effects between studies that used eHealth as an add-on or as a replacement to care as usual (P=.95), between studies that assessed stand-alone eHealth and blended strategies combining eHealth with face-to-face care (P=.23), or between studies of fully automated interventions and guided eHealth interventions (P=.83). Evidence for the long-term follow-up effectiveness of eHealth adherence interventions remains undecided owing to a scarcity of available studies and their mixed results. CONCLUSIONS eHealth interventions for adults with OSA can improve adherence to CPAP in the initial months after the start of treatment, increasing the mean nightly duration of use by about half an hour. Uncertainty still exists regarding the timing, duration, intensity, and specific types of eHealth interventions that could be most effectively implemented by health care providers.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aardoom, Jiska Jo\u00EBlle; Loheide-Niesmann, Lisa; Ossebaard, Hans C; Riper, Heleen","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/16972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32130137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPAP","OSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPAP adherence","CPAP treatment adherence","guided eHealth interventions","CONCLUSIONS eHealth interventions","stand-alone eHealth","long-term follow-up effectiveness of eHealth adherence interventions","specific types of eHealth interventions","broad range of eHealth interventions","effectiveness of available eHealth technologies","mean postintervention adherence","automated interventions","average nightly use of CPAP","BACKGROUND Poor adherence","adults","treatment problems","start of treatment","average number of nightly hours of CPAP use","scarcity of available studies","mean nightly duration of use","face-to-face care","comprehensive meta-analysis software","adult OSA populations","experimental intervention","meta-analytic review","MD","risk of bias","health care providers","Cochrane Collaboration risk","significant differences","subsequent intervention","blended strategies","initial months","communication technologies","bias tool","Postintervention data","mixed results","obstructive sleep apnea","databases of Cochrane Library","real-time monitoring of apnea symptoms","continuous positive airway pressure","relevant randomized controlled trials","self-management","daily life","undecided owing","early identification","patient education","Embase","device","systematic literature search","PsycINFO","PubMed","intensity","comparisons","items","effects","METHODS","timing","control conditions","Subgroup analyses","Evidence","OBJECTIVE","length","information","replacement","add-on","common issue","baseline","Uncertainty"],"language":"en"},

Few case reports have discussed complications from free intraperitoneal staples after appendectomy. We present the first case of a volvulus caused by a free staple that subsequently required bowel resection. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 27-year-old female underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. The base of the appendix was divided using a laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler and the mesoappendix was divided using a LigaSure device. The patient was discharged the following day. Eight days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, emesis, and peritoneal signs. Computed tomography (CT) showed significant pneumoperitoneum and nonspecific small bowel edema. Exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing a necrotic small bowel segment from a malformed, free staple caught on the peritoneum of the small bowel mesentery causing a closed loop obstruction. After reduction and detorsion, the small bowel segment was not viable and required resection. She was discharged on postoperative day four with no additional perioperative complications. DISCUSSION Mechanical staplers are commonly used in laparoscopic appendectomy and free intraperitoneal staples are generally considered inert. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for the early postoperative appendectomy patient with obstructive symptoms. CONCLUSION Inspection of the staple line, choosing the appropriate staple size and cartridge, and removing free malformed staples if seen should be employed during appendectomy to prevent rare but devastating complications.","publish_time":"2019-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Rachel; Moore, Ryan; Schmidt, Lauren; Martin, Katherine; Sjoholm, Lars Ola; Mason, Leonard; Beard, Jessica","journal":"International journal of surgery case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2019.10.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31743842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["free staple","laparoscopic appendectomy","bowel resection","small bowel mesentery","free intraperitoneal staples","free malformed staples","necrotic small bowel segment","nonspecific small bowel edema","early postoperative appendectomy patient","staple line","laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis","appropriate staple size","INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic appendectomies","devastating complications","postoperative day","case reports","PRESENTATION OF CASE","additional perioperative complications","linear staplers","following day","DISCUSSION Mechanical staplers","significant pneumoperitoneum","emesis","severe abdominal pain","year-old female","cartridge","emergency department","GIA","obstructive symptoms","closed loop obstruction","uncomplicated appendicitis","mesoappendix","detorsion","peritoneal signs","Computed tomography","CONCLUSION Inspection","reduction","volvulus","Exploratory laparotomy","high index of suspicion","LigaSure device","base","days"],"language":"en"},

Because they are not chemically bound to these products and are widely used, the potential for environmental contamination is significant. Phthalates and their metabolites have been associated with endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment, among other adverse health effects, in laboratory animals and human epidemiologic studies. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are vulnerable to environmental pollutants due to their apex position in the food chain, long life spans, and habitat overlap with developed coastal areas. The objective of this study was to quantify phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine collected from bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, during May 2016 (n = 7) and May 2017 (n = 10). Screening of nine phthalate monoester metabolites in bottlenose dolphin urine was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using methods adapted from those used for analyzing human samples. At least one phthalate metabolite was detected in 71% of the dolphins sampled across both years, with the highest concentrations detected for monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM = 5.4 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.3-22.0 ng/ml) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; GM = 1.9 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.1-3.2 ng/ml).

We hypothesized that a region-specific effect might participate in this heterogeneity. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of alcohol dose on hypertension incidence using contemporary data through December 2017. Subjects were categorized according to their level of alcohol consumption as non-drinkers (reference) and low- (0.01 to 20.0 g/day), moderate- (20.1 to 40.0 g/day), moderate- to high- (40.1 to 60.0 g/day), and high-dose (\u003E 60.0 g/day) drinkers. We defined hypertension as a blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mmHg and/or the use of anti- hypertensive drugs. Results In total, 11 articles (seven Asian and four Western) were selected for our analysis. Among Asian men, a significantly elevated risk was observed even in the low alcohol dose group in comparison with the group with no alcohol consumption, and the risk increased in a dose-dependent manner (pooled relative risks [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 1.25 [1.13 to 1.38], 1.48 [1.27 to 1.72], 1.75 [1.43 to 2.15], and 1.78 [1.51 to 2.09]). Among Western men, a similar dose-response relationship was noted in general (p for subgroup difference \u003E 0.1), but a significantly elevated risk was evident only in the high-dose group (pooled relative risks [95% CI]: 1.22 [0.85 to 1.74], 1.57 [0.90 to 2.75], 1.47 [0.44 to 4.91], and 1.49 [1.02 to 2.18]). Conclusions Even low doses of alcohol can lead to the development of hypertension, particularly in Asian men.

The waste biomass as alternates solved the problems of high price and nonrenewable of traditional raw materials. The waste Zanthoxylum bungeanum branches were firstly selected as raw materials to prepare activated carbons. Interestingly, the pore structure and surface chemistry can be successfully controlled by adjusting the heating rate. The hierarchical porous carbons exhibited great potential for toluene adsorption. The micro-mesopore structure possessed unique spatial effect; micropores played a dominant role in adsorption process, especially narrow micropores (pore size \u2264 1.0 nm) emerged stronger adsorptive force toward toluene molecules due to overlapping attractive forces from neighboring pore walls. And mesopores not only displayed excellent transport diffusion but also provided adsorption sites. Additionally, the high graphitization degree enhanced the interaction between graphene layer equipped electron-rich regions and \u03C0-electrons on the aromatic ring by the \u03C0-\u03C0 conjugated effect. The hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups served as chemisorption sites and led to higher adsorption amounts. Fortunately, the regeneration can be achieved by thermal treatment at the low temperature (\u2264 150 \u00B0C) or even gas purging at room temperature (20 \u00B0C), which avoided an explosion accident in the process of high-temperature regeneration.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Bingman; Xie, Hongmei; Chen, Shengming; Liu, Biyan; Zhou, Guilin","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09115-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["toluene adsorption","adsorption process","adsorption sites","Activated carbon adsorption","process of high","temperature regeneration","higher adsorption amounts","\u03C0-\u03C0 conjugated effect","\u03C0-electrons","pore size","low temperature","room temperature","activated carbons","problems of high price","high graphitization degree","neighboring pore walls","narrow micropores","toluene molecules","chemisorption sites","nonrenewable of traditional raw materials","waste biomass","unique spatial effect","micro-mesopore structure","hierarchical porous carbons","waste Zanthoxylum bungeanum branches","graphene layer equipped electron-rich regions","interaction","attractive forces","nm","great potential","dominant role","stronger adsorptive force","aromatic ring","carbonyl functional groups","alternates","excellent transport diffusion","thermal treatment","gas purging","efficient technology","explosion accident","VOC removal","hydroxyl","mesopores","surface chemistry","heating rate"],"language":"en"},

Based on the evolutionary similarity with SARS-CoV, researchers propose that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal (GI) system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear. Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case. The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms. COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain.

We examined published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena","journal":"Human vaccines \u0026 immunotherapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1740560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD","RBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV virus","SARS-CoV patients","heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine","SARS-CoV RBD219-N1","SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain","RBD domains","RBM amino acid similarity","heterologous vaccine","mAbs","COVID","overall high amino acid similarity","published evidence","high sequence similarity","region","high-level neutralizing antibodies","receptor-binding motif","monoclonal antibodies","recombinant protein","homologous virus challenge","review of published studies","potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes","mice","protective immunity","minimal immunopathology","convalescent serum","Coronavirus Infectious Disease","Alhydrogel","possibility","support","spike","current good manufacturing practices","MA15 strain","viruses","findings","information"],"language":"en"},

Valproic acid (VPA) has shown anti-inflammatory activity and mild intrinsic antiviral effect. These properties warrant the study of VPA as a possible active treatment in persons with severe COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) will be given intravenous (i.v.) VPA at a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day and up to 60/kg/day (in 60 min i.v. infusions in 250 mL normal saline) as needed to reach plasma VPA concentrations of 50-100 mcg/mL (measured every 72 h). These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the primary outcome and for a further period of 30 days after treatment completion for the secondary outcome of recurrence. The primary study outcome is the reduction in the case fatality rate of at least 50% after 10 days of treatment (as compared with natural history). Secondary outcomes are the reduction of length of stay (LOS) of at least 50%, as well as COVID-19 recurrence at 30-day follow-up. The most important safety outcomes are acute liver failure, acute pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the urgent need for a drug against COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the study of VPA is justified from a scientific standpoint.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiquete, E.; Toapanta-Yanchapaxi, L.; Cantu-Brito, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca81ebc9ae55276d0695ee6f31efddb5f8c299dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20079988v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Valproic"],"organizations":["VPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of VPA","severe COVID","days of treatment","plasma VPA concentrations","chronic use of VPA","primary study outcome","acute pancreatitis","primary outcome","secondary outcome of recurrence","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute liver failure","acute lung injury","treatment completion","Secondary outcomes","LOS","day follow-up","severe atypical pneumonia","possible active treatment","reduction of length","Coronavirus disease","Consecutive adult patients","important safety outcomes","anti-inflammatory activity","invasive mechanical ventilation","long-term adverse effects","pro-inflammatory consequences","mild intrinsic antiviral effect","IMV","persons","period","urgent need","Methods","SARS-CoV","death","systemic entity","high mortality","case fatality rate","Conclusion","infusions","drug","thrombocytopenia","stay","Background","normal saline","Valproic acid","natural history","starting dose","scientific standpoint","mcg","properties"],"language":"en"},

Without efficacious drugs or vaccines, mass quarantine has been the main strategy adopted by governments to contain the virus spread. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of infected people and deaths and to a diminished pressure over the health care system. However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. Nevertheless, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures. Epidemiological models are therefore necessary to forecast possible new infection outbreaks and to inform government to promptly adopt new containment measures. In this context, we tested here if technical analysis methods commonly used in the financial market might provide early signal of change in the direction of SARS-Cov-2 infection trend in Italy, a country which has been strongly hit by the pandemic.

While several countries have chosen the almost complete lock-down for slowing down SARS-CoV-2 spread, scientific community is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment of the dangerous COVID-19. With this aim we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis, which allows to gain new insights about the main conformational changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favour human cell invasion. Furthermore, our analysis provides i) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, for preventing interactions with the human ACE2, and ii) instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies, according to chemical/physical space restraints and complementary determining regions (CDR) mutagenesis of the identified existing antibodies. The proposed antibodies show in silico a high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present and future coronavirus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ACE2. More in general, our analysis provides indications for the set-up of the right biological molecular context for investigating spike RBD-ACE2 interactions for the development of new vaccines, diagnosis kits and other treatments based on the usage or the targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mercurio, Ivan; Tragni, Vincenzo; Busco, Francesco; De Grassi, Anna; Pierri, Ciro Leonardo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c17c03ba31a61ae2fd440327a96be4cae5adf085.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","World Health Organization","RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new coronavirus SARS-CoV","spike RBD-ACE2 interactions","human ACE2","new high affinity antibodies","new tools","new insights","new possible neutralizing antibodies","reference antibodies","targeting of SARS","proposed antibodies","spike proteins","development of new vaccines","human cells angiotensin","identified existing antibodies","human cell invasion","spread","silico comparative modeling analysis","diagnosis kits","dangerous COVID","future coronavirus able","receptor binding domain","complementary determining regions","CDR","mutagenesis","chemical","physical space restraints","right biological molecular context","set-up","enzyme","instructions","recent severe acute respiratory syndrome","main conformational changes","Corona Virus Disease","level","treatments","indications","ideal pipeline","state of emergency","devastating outbreak","usage","scientific community","pandemic","complete lock","World Health Organization","countries"],"language":"en"},

However, due to the nature of contact tracing, public concern on privacy issues has been a bottleneck to the existing solutions, which is significantly affecting the uptake of contact tracing applications across the globe. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt blockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize the user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract tracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the additional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible. Results show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and mobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public, the proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities, companies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy effective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic soon. Meanwhile, the open initiative of BeepTrace allows worldwide collaborations, integrate existing tracing and positioning solutions with the help of blockchain technology.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Hao; Zhang, Lei; Onireti, Oluwakayode; Fang, Yang; Buchanan, William Bill; Imran, Muhammad Ali","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99bf67b463cfb141228867306b3be61c580ee32a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10103v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective contact tracing solutions","existing tracing","contact tracing scheme","nature of contact tracing","uptake of contact tracing applications","effective digital contact tracing applications","proposed contract tracing solutions","existing solutions","blockchain-enabled privacy","positioning solutions","privacy issues","privacy concerns","mobile phone applications","proposed BeepTrace solution","pandemic","mobile phone perspectives","open initiative of BeepTrace","help of blockchain technology","public concern","user ID","outbreak of COVID","approach","worldwide collaborations","companies","timely framework","higher security","urgent need","required resource","additional advantages","authorities","authorized solvers","server","software developers","viability","terms","battery friendly","researchers","patient","bottleneck","location information","infection","globe","Results","paper"],"language":"en"},

We want to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR. Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs, methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarials. 802 patients were on ts/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren, polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital admissions regardless other factors. Exposition to ts/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical signification. Use of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and csDMARDs dropped from the final model. Conclusion: This study provides additional evidence in IRD patients regarding susceptibility to moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandez-Gutierrez, B.; Leon, L.; Madrid, A.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, L.; Freites, D.; Font, J.; Mucientes, A.; Colomer, J.

In the current situation that effective medical treatments such as antiviral drugs are not discovered yet, dynamical features of the epidemics should be clarified for establishing strategies for tracing, quarantine, isolation, and regulating social behavior of the public at appropriate costs. Here we propose a network model for SARS epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals. This is in marked contrast with epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases or computer viruses to which scale-free network models often apply.","publish_time":"2004-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masuda, Naoki; Konno, Norio; Aihara, Kazuyuki","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f53349af371754609cdc04da17f4a28358a39050.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0401598v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemics","hospitals","social behavior","superspreaders","heterogeneous rates of social contacts","social group properties","human contacts","key factors","recent outbreak","contagious places","contagious patients","biological nature of individuals","small-world networks","scale-free network models","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","effective medical treatments","computer viruses","transmitted diseases","isolation","antiviral drugs","current situation","strategies","quarantine","public","good measure","appropriate costs","marked contrast","suspected cases","tracing","dynamical features","spreads","possible resurgence","mass transmission"],"language":"en"},

Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the COVID-19 virus origin by using artificial intelligence (AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined COVID-19 virus genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidences strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the COVID-19 virus. At the whole genome analysis level, our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Thanh Thi; Abdelrazek, Mohamed; Nguyen, Dung Tien; Aryal, Sunil; Nguyen, Duc Thanh; Khatami, Amin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d198ef61896080107a449f39dab94444338c6f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091397","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus origin","genome sequences of COVID","examined COVID","pangolins","bats","infected cases","raw genomic sequences","probable hosts","original hosts","pangolin coronavirus genomes","clustering algorithms","scientific hypotheses","novel coronavirus","scientific community","global pandemic","unsupervised clustering methods","Recent research results","genome analysis level","various AI-enabled experiments","artificial intelligence","comparative studies","deaths of thousands","findings","different countries","people","world","disease","evidences","paper"],"language":"en"},

Yet, healthcare decision-making and communication for this population can pose significant challenges. As a result, healthcare professionals may struggle to help patients define and prioritise their values, goals, and preferences in ways that are clinically and personally meaningful, incorporating physical functioning and quality of life, when faced with numerous diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The aim of this systematic review is to locate and synthesise a body of fine-grained observational research on communication between professionals, older adults, and carers regarding self-management in audio/audio-visually recorded naturalistic interactions. METHODS/DESIGN The paper describes a systematic review of the published conversation analytic and discourse analytic research, using an aggregative thematic approach and following the PRISMA-P guidelines. This review will include studies reporting on adult patients (female or male) aged \u2265 60 years whose consultations are conducted in English in any healthcare setting and stakeholders involved in their care, e.g. general practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, and family carers. We will search nine electronic databases and the grey literature and two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts to identify potential studies. Discrepancies will be resolved via consultation with the review team. The methodological quality of the final set of included studies will be appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research and a detailed description of the characteristics of the included studies using a customised template. DISCUSSION This is the first systematic review to date to locate and synthesise the conversation analytic research on how healthcare professionals raise and pursue talk about self-management with older adults in routine clinical interactions. Amalgamating these findings will enable the identification of effective and potentially trainable communication practices for engaging older adults in healthcare decision-making about the self-management goals and actions that enable the greatest possible health and quality of life in older adulthood.

Although many different atlases are publicly available, they are usually biased with respect to an imaging modality and the age distribution. Both effects are well known to negatively impact the accuracy and reliability of the spatial normalization process using non-linear image registration methods. An important and very active neuroscience area that lacks appropriate atlases is lesion-related research in elderly populations (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis) for which FLAIR MRI and non-contrast CT are often the clinical imaging modalities of choice. To overcome the lack of atlases for these tasks and modalities, this paper presents high-resolution, age-specific FLAIR and non-contrast CT atlases of the elderly generated using clinical images.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajashekar, Deepthi; Wilms, Matthias; MacDonald, M Ethan; Ehrhardt, Jan; Mouches, Pauline; Frayne, Richard; Hill, Michael D; Forkert, Nils D","journal":"Scientific data","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0379-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["appropriate atlases","different atlases","lack of atlases","non-contrast CT atlases","Normative brain atlases","neuroscience research","spatial normalization of image datasets","clinical imaging modalities of choice","spatial normalization process","age-specific FLAIR","elderly populations","FLAIR MRI","imaging modality","age distribution","clinical images","lesion-related research","active neuroscience area","non-linear image registration methods","voxel-based analyses of brain morphology","standard tool","multiple sclerosis","paper","stroke","function","reliability","tasks","example","accuracy","respect","effects"],"language":"en"},

Psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, and stress have been suggested as influencing dysmenorrhea, but previous findings are inconsistent. This study will investigate the relationship between depression/anxiety/stress and dysmenorrhea using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS Online databases including PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase will be searched. Appropriate keywords and MeSH terms will be used to retrieve the journal papers published from 1990 until the end of December 2019. To improve search coverage, the reference lists of all included studies will be reviewed to find eligible papers. Inclusion criteria include the following: descriptive, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies; the relationship between depression/anxiety/stress and dysmenorrhea being an objective of the study; and published in peer-reviewed journals. The paper selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of selected studies will be performed independently by two researchers, and disagreements will be resolved through discussions. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale will be used to assess the quality of selected studies. A quantitative synthesis will be performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) via the STATA software, if retrieving enough number of studies with no severe methodological heterogeneities. Otherwise, qualitative synthesis will be used to report the findings. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first systematic review on this topic. Performing an inclusive search in major databases over a wide timescale is one key strength of the proposed study and will maximize the coverage of the original research studies on this topic. Results of present study are expected to lead to deeper understanding the relationship between common mental health conditions and dysmenorrhea.

METHODS In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 56 \u00B1 13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.

By studying trading networks, we might better understand the dynamics of livestock diseases. We constructed ingoing contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain that were linked by trading, to elucidate potential pathways for the transmission of infection and to evaluate their effect on the risk of a farm experiencing a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incident. Our findings are consistent with variation in bTB risk associated with region, herd size, disease risk area and history of previous bTB incidents on the root farm and nearby farms. However, we also identified effects of both direct and indirect trading patterns, such that connections to more farms in the England High-Risk Area up to three movements away from the root farm increased the odds of a bTB incident, while connections with more farms in the England Low-Risk Area up to eight movements away decreased the odds. Relative to other risk factors for bTB, trading behaviours are arguably more amenable to change, and consideration of risks associated with indirect trading, as well direct trading, might therefore offer an additional approach to bTB control in Great Britain.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fielding, Helen R; McKinley, Trevelyan J; Delahay, Richard J; Silk, Matthew J; McDonald, Robbie A","journal":"Royal Society open science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Great Britain","England"],"keyphrases":["bTB risk","trading behaviours","Trading animals","trading networks","bTB control","indirect trading patterns","disease risk area","risk factors","nearby farms","England Low-Risk Area","root farm","history of previous bTB incidents","Great Britain","England High-Risk Area","connections","movements","odds","ingoing contact chains of cattle farms","region","herd size","variation","additional approach","bovine tuberculosis","potential pathways","markets","transmission of infection","consideration of risks","findings","effects","dynamics of livestock diseases","conduit","infections"],"language":"en"},

The GH-soft hydrogel was capable of facilitating the proliferation of DFBs and the synthesis of extracellular components, as compared to GH-hard hydrogels. In addition, the subcutaneously injected GH-soft hydrogel with bioluminescent reporter cells provided enhanced cell survival and local retention over 14 days. In vivo transplantation of DFB-encapsulated GH-soft hydrogels accelerated wound contraction, and promoted collagen deposition and neovascularization within the incisions performed on mice skin.

SETTING PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jieyun; Zhong, Zhimei; Ji, Pan; Li, Hongyuan; Li, Bocheng; Pang, Jielong; Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhao, Chunling","journal":"Family medicine and community health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/fmch-2020-000406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopaenia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic patients","experienced symptoms of patients","clinicopathological characteristics of patients","small percentage of patients","higher proportion of infected patients","clinical symptoms","elevated procalcitonin","Minor symptoms","common symptoms","major symptoms","meta-analysis","elevated levels of C reactive protein","elevated C reactive protein levels","related studies","DESIGN Studies","elevated D-dimer","normal leucocyte counts","elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate","unique retrospective studies","confirmed cases of COVID","Lymphopaenia","anorexia","chest tightness","fever","myalgia","coronavirus disease","dyspnoea","cough","abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes","abnormal renal function","China Science","Chinese Biomedical Literature Database","case series","case-control","clinical decisions","liver function","Technology Journal Database","China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases","Wanfang","sufficient details","laboratory outcomes","Embase","cohort","SETTING PubMed","vomiting","summary","male","risk of publication bias","relevant data","viral origin","reference","research","PARTICIPANTS","total","nausea","fatigue","shivering","pharyngalgia","headache","study","diarrhoea","expectoration","leucopenia","leucocytosis","CONCLUSIONS","carriers","rhinorrhea","OBJECTIVE","findings","reviewers"],"language":"en"},

It is important to highlight that one of the main characteristics of this pandemic is the oversaturation of the health system capacity, mostly due to a high demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), Hospital/ICU beds, as well as ventilators. In places with limited resources and where the health care systems are already saturated, such consideration is even more worrisome. Therefore, most worldwide authorities are recommending to avoid, as much as possible, patient\u0027s elective visits to hospitals, as well as a judicious use of the operating room in order to mitigate the strain put on the health system.

A wide range of real-time PCR (rtPCR) assays are used in our laboratory (National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark) for pathogen detection, and PCR analyses are performed on traditional rtPCR platforms in which a limited number of samples can be analyzed per day given limitations in equipment and personnel. To mitigate these restrictions, rtPCR assays have been optimized for the high-throughput rtPCR BioMark platform (Fluidigm). Using this platform, we developed a high-throughput detection system that can be used for simultaneous examination of 48 samples with detection specificity for 18 selected respiratory and enteric viral and bacterial pathogens of high importance to Danish pig production. The rtPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using a BioMark 48.48 dynamic array (DA) integrated fluidic circuit chip, and the sensitivity and specificity were assessed by testing known positive samples.

Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases reported in Guangzhou and Wenzhou as of 29 February, 2020 were collected. The incidence curves of COVID-19 in two cities were constructed. The real time reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. Results: A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively. In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%).

The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant.

Methods: Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Limma package in R language to screen for differentially expressed genes. The two sets of differential genes were introduced into the R language cluster Profiler package for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Two sets of intersections were taken. A protein interaction network was constructed for all differentially expressed genes using STRING database and core genes were screened. Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. Results: The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, \u0394E group, \u03943 group, \u03945 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group. After the difference analysis, 191 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes were defined. The GEO126062 heart failure data set was retrieved and screened from the GEO database. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 165 were up-regulated and 330 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes between coronavirus and heart failure was performed. After cross processing, there were 20 GO entries, which were mainly enriched in virus response, virus defense response, type \u2160 interferon response, \u03B3 interferon regulation, innate immune response regulation, negative regulation of virus life cycle, replication regulation of viral genome, etc . There are 5 KEGG pathways, mainly interacting with tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, human giant cells viral infection related. All differentially expressed genes were introduced into the SREING online analysis website for protein interaction network analysis, and core genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, IL-10, IL17, TNF, interferon regulatory factor 9, 2\u0027-5\u0027-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10, caspase 3 and other genes were screened. The drugs predicted by EpiMed\u0027s apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis are mainly TNF-\u03B1 inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. Conclusions: The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection. Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects. Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, X M; Cao, F; Zhang, H M; Chen, H R; Zhang, J D; Zhi, P; Li, Z Y; Wang, Y X; Lu, X C","journal":"Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200308-00172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially"],"organizations":["Gene Expression Omnibus","GEO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated genes","core genes","coronavirus infection","sets of differential genes","cause of heart failure","mechanism of heart failure","pathway enrichment analysis","GEO126062 heart failure data set","interferon response","virus response","protein interaction network analysis","difference analysis","Correlation analysis","immune response regulation","\u03945 group","\u03943 group","\u0394E group","wt group","control group","GSE59185 coronavirus data set","GEO database","\u03B3 interferon regulation","virus defense response","receptor interaction","disease-drug association analysis","replication regulation of viral genome","SREING online analysis website","negative regulation of virus life cycle","gene ontology","Kyoto gene","retinoic acid","forsythia","interferon regulatory factor","ritonavir","KEGG pathways","resveratrol","omics data","present results","therapeutic effects","STRING database","human giant cells viral infection","accurate treatment prediction platform","potential effective therapeutic drugs","Gene Expression Omnibus","R language cluster Profiler package","c-x","EpiMed\u0027s apparent precision treatment prediction platform","mitogen-activated protein kinase","genome encyclopedia","Limma package","Present study","houttuynia cordata","sets of intersections","TNF-\u03B1 inhibitors","tumor necrosis factor","c motif chemokine ligand","abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways","radical s-adenosyl methionine domain","paeony","signal transducer","caspase","different subtypes","IL17","amaranth","cytokine","Toll","patients","clinical research","activator of transcription","oligoadenylate synthetase","Conclusions","Objective","Methods","experimental requirements","team","hypothesis","cross processing","entries","total"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, graphene oxide was used as a template to prepare ZIF-67, and GO/ZIF-67 was successfully prepared. GO/ZIF-67 was used for the first time to remove boron from water. SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mg\u00B7g-1 at 25 \u00B0C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics and XPS, it is known that there is chemisorption during the adsorption process, and mainly the combination of boron and cobalt sites.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Guangzhuang; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yuantao; Xu, Cheng; Liu, Rong; Han, Zhen","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08018-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zeta"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adsorption of boron","adsorption process","adsorption thermodynamics","adsorption kinetics","physical adsorption","adsorption capacity of boron","adsorption mechanism of boron","adsorption isotherm","ZIF","combination of boron","excessive boron","boron pollution","boron industry","spontaneous endothermic process","paper","graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding","order kinetic model","equilibrium","positive charge","entropy change","characterization methods","XRD","surface","human health","cobalt sites","template","Zeta potential","development","SEM","time","water","XPS","chemisorption","structure","cycles"],"language":"en"},

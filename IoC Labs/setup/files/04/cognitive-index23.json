Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-PS) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor-PS was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR. Overall, high TRM rates rather than DAM contribute to the poor outcomes of Pt-non-CR, suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant-related complications is required for allo-HSCT in ATL patients.","publish_time":"2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomori, Shouhei; Morishima, Satoko; Nishi, Yukiko; Nakachi, Sawako; Tamaki, Keita; Morichika, Kazuho; Tedokon, Iori; Shimabukuro, Natsuki; Hanashiro, Taeko; Kitamura, Sakiko; Uchibori, Sachie; Miyagi, Riko; Miyagi, Takashi; Karimata, Kaori; Ohama, Masayo; Yamanoha, Atsushi; Tomoyose, Takeaki; Karube, Kennosuke; Fukushima, Takuya; Masuzaki, Hiroaki","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eb4f69bf719bb209575132a945a6899ebaa0fd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091703.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATL"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["Pt-CR","Pt-non-CR","yOS of Pt","poor outcomes of Pt","ATL patients","non-complete remission","higher DAM","higher TRM","higher sIL","allo-HSCT","poor-PS","high sIL","high TRM rates","poor performance status","R level","Transplant-related mortality","disease-associated mortality","ATL endemic area of Okinawa","year overall survival","Outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","management of transplant","disease control","related complications","median survival time","adult T cell leukemia","lymphoma","Multivariable analysis","regional retrospective study","cohort","Japan","significant difference","months"],"language":"en"},

Recently, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to be quite efficacious in silencing target genes. RNA interference is a natural mechanism, conserved in nature from Yeast to Humans, by which siRNAs operate to specifically and potently downregulate the expression of a target gene either transcriptionally (targeted to DNA) or post-transcriptionally (targeted to mRNA). The specificity and relative simplicity of siRNA design insinuate that siRNAs will prove to be favorable therapeutic agents. Since siRNAs are a small nucleic acid reagents, they are unlikely to elicit an immune response and genes encoding these siRNAs can be easily manipulated and delivered by lentiviral vectors to target cells. As such, lentiviral vectors expressing siRNAs represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral infections such as HIV-1. This review will focus on the development, lentiviral based delivery, and the potential therapeutic use of siRNAs in treating viral infections.","publish_time":"2006-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morris, K V; Rossi, J J","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b2a30356babda85cfe214551cf4fa1cf6a6cae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091755.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lentiviral vectors","potential therapeutic use of siRNAs","treatment of viral infections","silencing target genes","potential therapeutic approach","antiviral genes","lentiviral based delivery","HIV","favorable therapeutic agents","nondividing cells","small interfering RNAs","small nucleic acid reagents","promising system","relative simplicity of siRNA design","natural mechanism","nature","specificity","development","Yeast","immune response","RNA interference","Humans","DNA","expression","mRNA","review"],"language":"en"},

The Opium War largely influenced the history of China in 19th century; however, China was once recognized as a drug-free nation for 3 decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. Drug abuse has spread quickly since re-emerging as a national problem in China in the late 1980s. The number of registered drug abusers increased from 70 000 in 1990 to more than 1 million by the end of 2005. In past decades, illicit drug trafficking and production have swept most provinces in China, and drug abuse has caused many problems for both abusers and the community. One major drug-related problem is the spread of HIV, which has caused major social and economic damage in China. Germany, the largest developed European country, also faces the drug and addiction problem. Germany has about 150 000 heroin addicts, for whom HIV/AIDS has become a serious threat since the mid 1980s. To control the drug problem, the German Government adopted the \u201CAction Plan on Drugs and Addiction\u201D in 2003; the China Central Government approved a similar regulation in the antidrug campaign in 2005. Germany has experience in reducing drug-related harm. The methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program has run for more than 20 years and the public has become more tolerant of addicts. In 2003, China began the MMT program for controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is necessary for China to learn from developed countries to acquire success in its antidrug campaign. In this review, we will go over the differences and similarities in drug abuse between Germany and China. The differences are related to history, population and economics, drug policy context, drug laws, HIV/hepatitis C virus infection, the MMT program and so on. These 2 nations have drug abuse problems with different histories and currently use different approaches to handle illicit drug marketing and use. The legal penalties for illicit drug offences reflect the social differences of these 2 nations with respect to the seriousness of particular types of crimes. The characteristics of the MMT program may also influence patterns of drug abuse in these 2 nations and China should improve the MMT program based on the successful model in Europe, the USA, and Australia. We recommend more dialogue and collaboration between Germany and China.","publish_time":"2007-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michels, Ingo Ilja; Fang, Yu-xia; Zhao, Dong; Zhao, Li-yan; Lu, Lin","journal":"Acta Pharmacol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa2e59e8c8cb603089fe4e7924b3728d2100e71f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["China","Europe","Germany","Australia"],"keyphrases":["drug problem","drug laws","drug abuse problems","patterns of drug abuse","history of China","illicit drug trafficking","illicit drug offences","illicit drug marketing","drug-related harm","major drug-related problem","drug policy context","drug-free nation","Germany","number of registered drug abusers","MMT program","China Central Government","spread of HIV","different history","nations","addiction problem","social differences","national problem","different approaches","different histories","AIDS","antidrug campaign","German Government","past decades","developed countries","heroin addicts","tolerant of addicts","largest developed European country","hepatitis C virus infection","similar regulation","population","economics","production","Action Plan","respect","successful model","provinces","re-emerging","USA","seriousness of particular types of crimes","methadone maintenance treatment","legal penalties","economic damage","experience","similarities","serious threat","public","Drugs","dialogue","collaboration","century","Opium War","Australia","community","characteristics","years","review","end"],"language":"en"},

It is essential for the interaction of the virons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelop with host cell membrane to allow infection. Some spike proteins of coronavirus, such as MHV, HCoV-OC43, AIBV and BcoV, are proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. In contrast, TGV, FIPV and HCoV-229E are not. Many studies have shown that the cleavage of spike protein seriously affects its function. In order to investigate the maturation and proteolytic processing of the S protein of SARS CoV, we generated S1 and S2 subunit specific antibodies (Abs) as well as N, E and 3CL protein-specific Abs. Our results showed that the antibodies could efficiently and specifically bind to their corresponding proteins from E.coli expressed or lysate of SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cells by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the anti-S1 and S2 Abs were proved to be capable of binding to SARS CoV under electron microscope observation. When S2 Ab was used to perform immune precipitation with lysate of SARS-CoV infected cells, a cleaved S2 fragment was detected with S2-specific mAb by Western blot analysis. The data demonstrated that the cleavage of S protein was observed in the lysate, indicating that proteolytic processing of S protein is present in host cells.","publish_time":"2004-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"WU, Xiao Dong; SHANG, Bo; YANG, Rui Fu; YU, Hao; MA, Zhi Hai; SHEN, Xu; JI, Yong Yong; LIN, Ying; WU, Ya Di; LIN, Guo Mei; TIAN, Lin; GAN, Xiao Qing; YANG, Sheng; JIANG, Wei Hong; DAI, Er Hei; WANG, Xiao Yi; JIANG, Hua Liang; XIE, You Hua; ZHU, Xue Liang; PEI, Gang; LI, Lin; WU, Jia Rui; SUN, Bing","journal":"Cell Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b84856fa2bf61e462f2cfe3545286469418ed8de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091875.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-specific","S protein of SARS CoV","S2 Abs","cleavage of S protein","cleavage of spike protein","lysate of SARS","S2-specific mAb","proteolytic processing of S protein","CoV infected cells","host cells","S2 subunit specific antibodies","cleaved S2 fragment","spike proteins of coronavirus","CoV infected Vero-E6 cells","host cell receptors","host cell membrane","Western blot analysis","corresponding proteins","anti-S1","HCoV-OC43","major structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","virons","subsequent fusion","MHV","capable of binding","immune precipitation","coli","electron microscope observation","AIBV","FIPV","interaction","maturation","contrast","TGV","BcoV","infection","results","order","data","function","subunits","studies"],"language":"en"},

Four vectors, DNA, SFV, human serotype 5 adenovirus (HuAd5) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) poxvirus, all expressing hepatitis C virus Core, E1, E2 and NS3, were combined in three prime-boost regimen, and their ability to elicit immune responses against HCV antigens in rhesus macaques was explored and compared. All combinations induced specific T-cell immune responses, including high IFN-\u03B3 production. The group immunized with the SFV\u002BMVA regimen elicited higher E2-specific responses as compared with the two other modalities, while animals receiving HuAd5 injections elicited lower IL-4 responses as compared with those receiving MVA. The IFN-\u03B3 responses to NS3 were remarkably similar between groups. Only the adenovirus induced envelope-specific antibody responses, but these failed to show neutralizing activity. Therefore, the two novel regimens failed to induce superior responses as compared with already existing HCV vaccine candidates. Differences were found in response to envelope proteins, but the relevance of these remain uncertain given the surprisingly poor correlation with immunogenicity data in chimpanzees, underlining the difficulty to predict efficacy from immunology studies.

Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity. NGS-based serology via SERA provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamath, Kathy; Reifert, Jack; Johnston, Timothy; Gable, Cameron; Pantazes, Robert J.; Rivera, Hilda N.; McAuliffe, Isabel; Handali, Sukwan; Daugherty, Patrick S.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b673c971353653abcb589c3b57dd0703eb3c9cc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SERA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chagas assay","Chagas repertoires","Chagas disease","non-Chagas","assay specificity","candidate Chagas antigens","unknown Chagas serostatus","high specificity","specificity equivalent","SERA","additional epitope repertoires","pathogen-specific antigens","blinded validation set","Leishmania cross-reactive epitope","antigenic epitopes","specific antibodies","combined sensitivity","serum epitope repertoire analysis","detection of pathogen","Antibody binding peptide motifs","high performance multiplex serological assays","mer peptide library","NGS-based serology","test exhibit undesirable performance","bacterial display random","diagnostic algorithms","effective approach","individuals","generation sequencing","separate tests","protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi","cornerstone of clinical diagnostics","method","parasitic infections","unblinding","panel"],"language":"en"},

To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Sam; Rogers, Tim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5be10098a412d15712e5cb1192c8ccdefcae7fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["communication networks","treelike networks","clustered networks","variety of real-world networks","particular network","particular contagion","setting of simple contagions","different nodes","individualized predictions","effective predictions","network saturation","epidemic simulations","complex contagions","information","low density","overall sudden transition","ideas","approach","infectious diseases","Global transport","good agreement","addition","method","message","need","speeds","quantities","processes","time","outbreak","design","theory"],"language":"en"},

An objective assessment of disease severity from acute physiological parameters would be of value in clinical practice and in the design of clinical trials. We hypothesised that there was a difference in the best early respiratory indices in those who died compared with those who survived. Design: A prospective observational study of 118 consecutive AHRF admissions with data analysis incorporating all blood gases. Setting: A pediatric intensive care unit in a national children\u2019s hospital. Interventions: None. Results: Mortality was 26/118,22% (95% confidence interval 18\u201326%). There were no significant differences in the best alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO(2), torr), oxygenation index (OI), ventilation index (VI), or PaO(2)/FIO(2) during the first 2 days of intensive care between the survivors and non-survivors. Only the mean airway pressure (MAP, cm H(2)O) used for supportive care was significantly different on days 0 and 1 (p\u22640.05) with higher pressure being used in non-survivors. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify any gas exchange or ventilator parameter independently associated with mortality. Rather, all deaths were associated with coincident pathology or multi-organ system failure, or perceived treatment futility due to pre-existing diagnoses instead of unsupportable respiratory failure. When using previously published predictors of outcome (VI\u003E40 and OI\u003E40; A-aDO(2)\u003E450 for 24 h; A-aDO(2)\u003E470 or MAP\u003E23; or A-aDO(2)\u003E420) the risk of mortality was overestimated significantly in the current population. Conclusion: The original hypothesis was refuted. It appears that the outcome of AHRF in present day pediatric critical care is principally related to the severity of associated pathology and now no longer solely to the severity of respiratory failure. Further studies in larger series are needed to confirm these findings.","publish_time":"2013-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peters, M. J.; Tasker, R. C.; Kiff, K. M.; Yates, R.; Hatch, D.

Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in pregnant patients infected with dengue or malaria were studied. METHODS: The medical records of pregnant women admitted with either dengue or malaria infections from 2011\u20132015 to this hospital were reviewed. Clinical outcomes and laboratory tests were examined. RESULTS: Of 85 women, 56%, 21%, and 22% had contracted dengue, malaria, and multiple infections, respectively. Pregnant women who had contracted dengue fever alone were more likely to present to the hospital at an earlier gestational age (24 weeks, p = 0.03). Women with multiple infections, were more likely to deliver earlier (30 weeks, p \u003C 0.01). Women with malaria were more likely to have low birth weight deliveries (mean birth weight 2394 g, p = 0.03). The incidence of in-hospital deaths among the cohort was 7%.

PATIENTS: All consecutive patients admitted to the PICUs with influenza A (H1N1) viral infection from 15 June to 31 July 2009. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 437 patients with acute lower respiratory infection in PICUs, 147 (34%) were diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) related to critical illness. The median age of these patients was 10 months (IQR 3\u201359). Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 117 (84%) on admission. The rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 80% (118 of 147 patients). Initial non-invasive ventilation failed in 19 of 22 attempts (86%). Mortality at 28 days was 39% (n = 57). Chronic complex conditions (CCCs), acute renal dysfunction (ARD) and ratio PaO(2)/FiO(2) at day 3 on MV were independently associated with a higher risk of mortality.

Admission PaO(2)/FIO(2), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (DA-aO(2)) and PaCO(2) were 104\u00B148, 447\u00B1120 and 40\u00B110 mmHg, respectively. All patients were normotensive. During the initial NIPSV trial respiratory rate decreased from 34\u00B18 to 28\u00B110 breaths/min (p\u003C0.001) and arterial oxygenation improved (PaO(2)/FIO(2) 104\u00B148 vs 153\u00B149, DA-aO(2) 447\u00B1120 vs 370\u00B1180 mmHg, p\u003C0.001) while PaCO(2) remained unchanged. There were no hemodynamic effects. Subsequently, a total of 133 NIPSV trials were performed (median duration 55 min, range 30\u2013540 min) over 1\u20137 days. No complication occurred during NIPSV. Sixteen patients were intubated (66%) 1.3\u00B11 days after inclusion. Upon inclusion, the patients who were subsequently intubated were older (55\u00B115 vs 37\u00B112 years) and more severely hypoxemic (63\u00B111 vs 80\u00B115 mmHg, p\u003C0.05) than those not requiring intubation. Eight patients died (33%), all in the intubated group. Median lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital were longer in intubated patients (ICU 16 days, range 3\u201364 vs 6 days, range 3\u20137, p\u003C0.05; hospital 23 days, range 9\u201377 vs 9.5 days, range 4\u201342, p\u003C0.05). Mean daily total PRN points were stable throughout the NIPSV period and were not different between the groups. Only 14% of PRN points resulted from respiratory therapy interventions. PRN score was higher during the first 24 h following intubation than during the first 24 h of NIPSV (278\u00B155 vs 228\u00B124 points, p\u003C0.05). Conclusion: Despite initial improvement in arterial oxygenation with NIPSV in patients with ARF due to severe CAP, the intubation rate is high. However, the more favorable outcome and shorter ICU and hospital stays when intubation is avoided, as well as the short delay required to assess the success or failure of NIPSV warrants a trial of NIPSV in this setting. The nursing workload remains stable during NIPSV and does not result predominantly from respiratory therapy interventions.","publish_time":"2001-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jolliet, Philippe; Abajo, Blanca; Pasquina, Patrick; Chevrolet, Jean-Claude","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ec732c7eb588241b9062e46d922bfef7aca6354.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzYyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","PRN","University Hospital","ARF","NIPSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intubated patients","vs","failure of NIPSV","trial of NIPSV","h of NIPSV","NIPSV trials","NIPSV period","days","initial NIPSV trial respiratory rate","shorter ICU","Medical ICU","intubation rate","ARF","acute respiratory failure","daily PRN","respiratory therapy interventions","PRN score","University Hospital","mmHg","daily total PRN points","severe CAP","arterial oxygenation","nursing workload","intubated group","initial acute effects","severe community","initial improvement","DA-aO","Setting","years","Admission PaO","FIO","PaCO","inclusion","alveolar-arterial oxygen difference","favorable outcome","hemodynamic effects","median duration","Median lengths","admission APACHE","face mask","gas exchange","aspects of non-invasive pressure support ventilation","prior history of chronic lung disease","hemodynamics","Project Research","Measurements","success","clinical course","Design","observational study","results","pneumonia","SD","Conclusion","short delay","groups","Objective","breaths","complication"],"language":"en"},

For donors who commit colossal sums of money to outbreak response, the current model is neither efficient nor transparent. Innovative approaches to coordinate financing have recently been tested as part of a broader development agenda for humanitarian response. Adopting a system that enables donors to invest in disease outbreaks rather than actors represents an opportunity to deliver a more cost-effective, transparent, and unified global response to infectious disease outbreaks. Achieving this will be challenging, but the World Health Organization (WHO) must play a vital role. New thinking is required to improve emergency response in an increasingly crowded and financially convoluted global health arena.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Vageesh","journal":"J Public Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09b5b1c3d16ba90f756fa4a9a89eedcf75dd6c91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unified global response","emergency response","humanitarian response","global health emergencies","infectious disease outbreaks","convoluted global health arena","actors","donors","World Health Organization","current model","major current policy challenge needs attention","substantial financial commitment","stakeholders","multilateral agencies","governments","colossal sums of money","broader development agenda","common problem","nongovernmental organizations","opportunity","New thinking","Innovative approaches","financing","investment","vital role","system"],"language":"en"},

Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity. In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask. The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing. Initially a FiO(2) of 0.33 (range 0,28\u20130,38) proved necessary. The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5\u20138) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13\u201318). FiO(2) and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary. In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen. The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur. In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation. Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological. We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.","publish_time":"1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walz, M.; M\u00F6llenhoff, G.; Muhr, G.","journal":"Unfallchirurg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3b57c482663f6a825c99c75421584dcb69f9b47.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPAP","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients intubation","range","continuous administration of CPAP","common ventilation","initial CPAP level","Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","positive benefits","mbar","blunt chest trauma","Complications","FiO","non-invasive respiratory techniques","periods of spontaneous breathing","non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance","face-mask","ASB levels","standard method of treatment","impaired lung function","PEEP","faster recovery","active early mobilisation","established therapeutic strategy","normal communication","average ICU stay","question","pneumonia","comparison","prospective study","minor popularity","sedation","studies","indications","regimen"],"language":"en"},

In viral diseases for which specific treatment is available, real-time PCR assays are reliable diagnostic tools for timely initiation of appropriate therapy and for rapid assessment of the efficacy of antiviral treatment strategies. A retrospective review of samples from a group of seven adult cord blood stem cell recipients was made. Serum samples taken up to 180 days after transplantation were examined with quantitative real-time PCR for measurement of viral load (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected in samples taken from four patients (57%) in the period of 20\u201380 days after transplantation. Products of amplification of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA were found in samples taken between days 25 and 37 following UCBT from only one patient (14%). On the other hand, the majority of patients (n = 6, 86%) had HHV-7 DNA detected in the period 15\u201358 days after transplantation. Co-infection with HHV-7 was demonstrated at onset of all episodes of microbiologically confirmed CMV or HHV-6 infection. Our observations indicate that real-time PCR is not only useful for monitoring herpesviral infections in transplant recipients, but is also a powerful method for clarifying the relationships between the viral load and clinical symptoms.

Preeclampsia lacks effective therapies because of the poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. The aim of this paper is to review molecular signaling pathways that could be responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. METHOD OF STUDY: This article reviews the English-language literature for pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia based on genome-wide gene expression profiling and proteomic studies. RESULTS: We show that the expression of the genes and proteins involved in response to stress, host-pathogen interactions, immune system, inflammation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, growth and tissue remodeling was increased in preeclampsia. Several significant common pathways observed in preeclampsia overlap the datasets identified in TLR (Toll-like receptor)- and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-dependent signaling pathways. Placental oxidative stress and subsequent chronic inflammation are considered to be major contributors to the development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes recent advances in TLR- and RAGE-mediated signaling and the target molecules, and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.","publish_time":"2011-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sado, Toshiyuki; Naruse, Katsuhiko; Noguchi, Taketoshi; Haruta, Shoji; Yoshida, Shozo; Tanase, Yasuhito; Kitanaka, Takashi; Oi, Hidekazu; Kobayashi, Hiroshi","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/070eb41f7c0007f645c8efe92aa104b29ba98632.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of preeclampsia","development of preeclampsia","pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia","receptor","RAGE","TLR","review","poor understanding of disease pathogenesis","significant common pathways","carbohydrate metabolism","lipid metabolism","subsequent chronic inflammation","Placental oxidative stress","genome-wide gene expression profiling","immune system","host-pathogen interactions","advanced glycation end products","growth","English-language literature","article","response","proteomic studies","dependent","recent advances","tissue remodeling","new insights","effective therapies","major contributors","pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome","leading causes of premature births","proteins","datasets","target molecules","CONCLUSION","paper","Toll","maternal death","METHOD OF STUDY","PROBLEM","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This was because a circulating kidney-derived renin angiotensin system was so similar and well established. But, the pursuit of brain RAS has proven to be correct. In the course of accepting brain RAS, high standards of proof attracted state of the art techniques in all the new developments of biolo1gy. Consequently, brain RAS is a robust concept that has enlightened neuroscience as well as cardiovascular physiology and is a model neuropeptide system. Molecular biology confirmed the components of brain RAS and their location in the brain. Transgenic mice and rats bearing renin and extra copies of angiotensinogen genes revealed the importance of brain RAS. Cre-lox delivery in vectors has enabled pinpoint gene deletion of brain RAS in discrete brain nuclei. The new concept of brain RAS includes ACE-2, Ang1\u20137, and prorenin and Mas receptors. Angiotensin II (ANG II) generated in the brain by brain renin has many neural effects. It activates behavioral effects by selective activation of ANG II receptor subtypes in different locations. It regulates sympathetic activity and baroreflexes and contributes to neurogenic hypertension. New findings implicate brain RAS in a much wider range of neural effects. We review brain RAS involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke memory, and learning alcoholism stress depression. There is growing evidence to consider developing treatment strategies for a variety of neurological disease states based on brain RAS.","publish_time":"2008-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillips, M.

These viruses often resist complete elimination and remain detectable at sanctuary sites, such as the kidneys and other extralymphatic organs. The mechanisms underlying this persistence are not well understood. Here we show that mice with potent virus-specific T-cell responses have reduced levels and delayed formation of neutralizing antibodies, and these mice fail to clear LCMV from extralymphatic epithelia. Transfer of virus-specific B cells but not virus-specific T cells augmented virus clearance from persistent sites. Virus elimination from the kidneys was associated with the formation of IgG deposits in the interstitial space, presumably from kidney-infiltrating B cells. CD8(\u002B) T cells in the kidneys of mice that did not clear virus from this site were activated but showed evidence of exhaustion. Thus, we conclude that in this model of infection, site-specific virus persistence develops as a consequence of potent immune activation coupled with reductions in virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that sanctuary-site formation depends both on organ anatomy and on the induction of different adaptive immune effector mechanisms. Boosting T-cell responses alone may not reduce virus persistence.

The essentials of critical care after liver transplantation are monitoring of transplant function, diagnosis of perfusion or biliary tract problems, specific substitution of coagulation factors and hemodynamic optimation due to avoidance of hepatic congestion. Many patients listed for heart transplantation need preoperative intensive care due to impaired heart function. Postoperatively a specific cardiac support with pulmonary arterial dilatators and inotropics is usually necessary. Lung transplantation aims at an improvement of patient quality of life.

One of the major challenges in multiplexed analysis is to identify each specific reaction with a distinct label or \u0027code\u0027(4). Two encoding strategies are currently used: positional encoding, in which every potential reaction is preassigned a particular position on a solid-phase support such as a DNA microarray(5,6,7,8), and reaction encoding, where every possible reaction is uniquely tagged with a code that is most often optical or particle based(4,9,10,11,12,13).

Managing bronchiolitis, both in the outpatient and inpatient setting remains a challenge to the treating pediatrician. The effectiveness of various interventions used for infants with bronchiolitis remains unclear. NEED AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the evidence supporting the use of currently available treatment and preventive strategies for infants with bronchiolitis and to provide practical guidelines to the practitioners managing children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: A search of articles published on bronchiolitis was performed using PubMed. The areas of focus were diagnosis, treatment and prevention of bronchiolitis in children. Relevant information was extracted from English language studies published over the last 20 years. In addition, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Supportive care, comprising of taking care of oxygenation and hydration, remains the corner-stone of therapy in bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry helps in guiding the need for oxygen administration. Several recent evidence-based reviews have suggested that bronchodilators or corticosteroids lack efficacy in bronchiolitis and should not be routinely used. A number of other novel therapies (such as nebulized hypertonic saline, heliox, CPAP, montelukast, surfactant, and inhaled furosemide) have been evaluated in clinical trials, and although most of them did not show any beneficial results, some like hypertonic saline, surfactant, CPAP have shown promising results.","publish_time":"2013-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verma, Nishant; Lodha, Rakesh; Kabra, S.

Several investigators have successfully utilized leukocyte-derived mRNA and discovery-based approaches to subgroup patients on the basis of biological similarities defined by transcriptomic signatures. A critical next step is to develop a consensus sepsis subclassification system, which includes transcriptomic signatures as well as other biological and clinical data.

Data suggest that both the extracellular matrix and the microbiota represent microenvironments that contribute to the onset and progression of tumours. Through the introduction of omics technologies and pyrosequencing analyses, a detailed investigation of these two microenvironments is now possible.

From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was \u003E8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SARS is facilitated by close contact with patients with symptomatic infection. The majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of SARS patients. Since SARS-CoV is contagious, measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure, and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts. This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene), contact precautions (gowns, goggles, gloves) and airborne precautions (negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks). In light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003\u20134 in China, it seems possible that SARS will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future, and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of the pneumonia evaluation.","publish_time":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"File, Thomas M.; Tsang, Kenneth W.

Proventriculitis was also associated with some new IBV strains. Aim of this study was to investigate by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the tissue tropism of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 in experimentally infected chicken embryos. RESULTS: To this end chicken embryos were inoculated in the allantoic sac with 10(3 )EID(50 )of IBV M41 at 10 days of age. At 48, 72, and 120 h postinoculation (PI), embryos and chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) were sampled, fixed, and paraffin-wax embedded. Allantoic fluid was also collected and titrated in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK). The sensitivity of IHC in detecting IBV antigens in the CAM of inoculated eggs matched the virus reisolation and detection in CEK. Using IHC, antigens of IBV were detected in nasal epithelium, trachea, lung, spleen, myocardial vasculature, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, sclera of the eye, spinal cord, as well as in brain neurons of the inoculated embryos. These results were consistent with virus isolation and denote the wide tissue tropism of IBV M41 in the chicken embryo. Most importantly, we found infection of vasculature and smooth muscle of the proventriculus which has not seen before with IBV strain M41. CONCLUSION: IHC can be an additional useful tool for diagnosis of IBV infection in chickens and allows further studies to foster a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of infections with IBV strains of different virulence. Moreover, these results underline that embryonic tissues in addition to CAM could be also used as possible source to generate IBV antigens for diagnostic purposes.","publish_time":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S; Zlotowski, Priscila; Veits, Jutta; Keil, G\u00FCnther M; Teifke, Jens P","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60bc864d9515f3919e673bf5eeadfbd60ef84770.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2657138.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19196466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IHC","CAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV antigens","antigens of IBV","IBV strain M41","different IBV strains","new IBV strains","diagnosis of IBV infection","IBV strains of different virulence","wide tissue tropism of IBV M41","inoculated embryos","infected chicken embryos","end chicken embryos","RESULTS","virus isolation","virus reisolation","sensitivity of IHC","tissue tropism of avian infectious bronchitis virus","CAM of inoculated eggs","chicken embryo kidney cells","infection of vasculature","CEK","variable tissue tropisms","myocardial vasculature","allantoic sac","Allantoic fluid","gastrointestinal tract","sclera","lung","spleen","liver","pathogenesis of infections","disease","additional useful tool","trachea","skin","nasal epithelium","respiratory system","eye","deeper understanding","studies","smooth muscle","detection","embryonic tissues","chorioallantoic membranes","chickens","immunohistochemistry","possible source","spinal cord","brain neurons","diagnostic purposes","proventriculus","oviduct","h postinoculation","BACKGROUND","EID","days of age","CONCLUSION","paraffin","kidneys","Proventriculitis","study"],"language":"en"},

Personal protective equipment was essential to prevent transmission. Owing to shortage of face masks, Taiwan government began to implement quasi rationing on February 6, 2020, by allowing each resident to purchase two masks in seven days. Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration offered online data with real-time updates on face mask availability in all contracted pharmacies and selected local health centers. Based on the open data, numerous software applications quickly emerged to assist the public in finding sales locations efficiently. METHODS: Up until March 15, 2020, the Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government had recorded 134 software applications of face mask availability, and 24 software applications were excluded due to defect, duplicate, and unavailability. These applications were analyzed according to platform, developer type, and display mode. RESULTS: Of the 110 valid software applications, 67 (60.9%) applications were deployed on websites, followed by 21 (19.1%) on social networking sites, 19 (17.3%) as mobile applications, and 3 (2.7%) in other modes. Nearly two thirds (n = 70) of applications were developed by individuals, one third (n = 37) by commercial companies, only two applications by central and local governments, and one by a nongovernmental organization. With respect to the display mode, 47 (42.7%) applications adopted map-view only, 41 (37.3%) adopted table-view only, and 19 (17.3%) adopted both modes. Of the remaining three applications, two offered voice user interfaces and one used augmented reality. CONCLUSION: Taiwan\u2019s open data strategy facilitated rapid development of software applications for information dissemination to the public during the COVID-19 crisis. The transparency of real-time data could help alleviate the panic of the public. The collaborative contributions from the grassroots in disasters were priceless treasures.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Eunice J.; Hsu, Chia-An; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang","journal":"J Chin Med Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c40a85310852db8451c6f037dbf9af3a9c567188.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199767.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["mobile applications","numerous software applications","valid software applications","software applications of face mask availability","rapid development of software applications","online data","transparency of real-time data","Taiwan\u2019s open data strategy","Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government","shortage of face masks","display mode","COVID","modes","Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration","real-time updates","selected local health centers","local governments","map-view","table-view","offered voice user interfaces","contracted pharmacies","information dissemination","grassroots","disasters","used augmented reality","developer type","CONCLUSION","platform","defect","Personal protective equipment","commercial companies","transmission","collaborative contributions","priceless treasures","quasi rationing","panic","social networking sites","duplicate","unavailability","coronavirus disease","sales locations","respect","RESULTS","crisis","individuals","nongovernmental organization","thirds","resident","days","websites","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Mortality rates are reportedly high without supportive treatment and care. Here we used next generation sequencing techniques to screen affected and unaffected individuals admitted to Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Perth between April and December 2015, with the resultant discovery of a novel nidovirus significantly associated with cases of respiratory disease according to a case definition based on clinical signs. Interestingly this virus was also found in 12% of apparently healthy individuals, which may reflect testing during the incubation period or a carrier status, or it may be that this agent is not causative in the disease process. This is the first report of a nidovirus in lizards globally. In addition to detection of this virus, characterisation of a 23,832 nt segment of the viral genome revealed the presence of characteristic nidoviral genomic elements providing phylogenetic support for the inclusion of this virus in a novel genus alongside Ball Python nidovirus, within the Torovirinae sub-family of the Coronaviridae. This study highlights the importance of next generation sequencing technologies to detect and describe emerging infectious diseases in wildlife species, as well as the importance of rehabilitation centres to enhance early detection mechanisms through passive and targeted health surveillance. Further development of diagnostic tools from these findings will aid in detection and control of this agent across Australia, and potentially in wild lizard populations globally.","publish_time":"2016-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Dea, Mark A.; Jackson, Bethany; Jackson, Carol; Xavier, Pally; Warren, Kristin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aee43bea8ff949773e7d22ebbfd6304c20c2a76d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5102451.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27828982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Perth","Australia"],"keyphrases":["novel nidovirus","wildlife care facilities","wildlife species","respiratory disease syndrome","cases of respiratory disease","disease process","agent","Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre","early detection mechanisms","Ball Python nidovirus","importance of rehabilitation centres","generation sequencing technologies","generation sequencing techniques","unaffected individuals","novel genus","healthy individuals","Perth metropolitan region of Western Australia","large numbers of wild shingleback lizards","wild lizard populations","presence of characteristic nidoviral genomic elements","Tiliqua rugosa","phylogenetic support","viral genome","targeted health surveillance","findings","Torovirinae sub-family","emerging infectious diseases","case definition","inclusion","screen","nt segment","supportive treatment","incubation period","testing","characterisation","control","Mortality rates","carrier status","development of diagnostic tools","clinical signs","Coronaviridae","resultant discovery","study","report","addition"],"language":"en"},

During the early stages of the HP-PRRSV infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are noted in the host peripheral blood, which are accompanied by severe lesions in the lungs and immune system organs; these are considered as the greatest contributors to the overall disease burden. We hypothesized that the anti-PRRSV response in piglets might be mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which led to a decrease in the psycho-neuroendocrinological manifestation of HP-PRRSV etiology via immune response regulation. RESULTS: We investigated the regulation of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets that were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight (b. w.)/day mifepristone (RU486) or 2 mg/kg b.w./day dexamethasone (DEX). Both RU486 and DEX enhanced the disease status of the piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, resulting in high mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: HP-PRRSV infection activates the HPA axis, and artificial regulation of the immune-endocrine system enhances disease severity in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets. Thus, DEX and RU486 should be avoided in the clinical treatment of HP-PRRS.

Severe encephalomyelitis, characterized by neuronophagia, focal gliosis and perivascular cuffing, was observed in the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Nasally infected pigs, in particular, developed lesions in the area of the stria olfactoria and tractus olfactorius. Coincident with the encephalitic changes, HEV antigen was observed first in the trigeminal ganglion cells and then in degenerating neurones. Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM)-containing cells were also found in perivascular cuffs and glial foci. They appeared at first on PID 7 and after that increased in number.

Current anti\u2010HBV medications have a number of drawbacks, such as adverse effects and drug resistance; thus, novel potential anti\u2010HBV reagents are needed. Selenium (Se) has been shown to be involved in both human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections, but its role in HBV infection remains unclear. To address this, sodium selenite (Na(2)SeO(3)) was applied to three HBV cell models: HepG2.2.15 cells, and HuH\u20107 cells transfected with either 1.1 or 1.3\u00D7 HBV plasmids. Cytotoxicity of Na(2)SeO(3) was examined by Cell Counting Kit\u20108. Levels of viral antigen expression, transcripts, and encapsidated viral DNA were measured by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, northern blot, and Southern blot, respectively. There was no obvious cytotoxicity in either HepG2.2.15 or HuH\u20107 cells with \u003C2.5 \u00B5M Na(2)SeO(3). Below this concentration, Na(2)SeO(3) suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg production, HBV transcript level, and amount of genomic DNA in all three tested models, and suppression level was enhanced in line with increases in Na(2)SeO(3) concentration or treatment time. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Na(2)SeO(3) on HBV replication can be further enhanced by combined treatment with lamivudine, entecavir, or adefovir. Thus, the present study clearly proves that Na(2)SeO(3) suppresses HBV protein expression, transcription, and genome replication in hepatoma cell models in a dose\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manner.

In this study, a culturing system for influenza was used to test the effect of maoto. A549 cells in the culture were infected with influenza virus A (PR8) and followed after treatment with maoto; the virus titers in the culture supernatant, intracellular viral proteins, and viral RNA were determined. When infected cells were cultured with maoto for 24 hr, the virus titer and protein were significantly reduced compared with medium only. Other subtypes, A/H3N2, H1N1pdm, and B, were also inhibited by maoto. Proliferation of viral RNA in a 6 hr culture was inhibited by maoto in the early phase, especially in the first 30 min. Focusing on the entry step of the influenza virus, we found that endosomal pH, regulated by vacuolar-type H(\u002B) ATPase (V-ATPase) located in the membrane, was increased when treated with maoto. We also found that uncoating of influenza viruses was also inhibited by maoto, resulting in the increase of the number of virus particles in endosomes. These results strongly suggest that the inhibition of endosomal acidification by maoto results in blocking influenza virus entry to cytoplasm, probably through the inhibition of V-ATPase. The present study provides evidence that supports the clinical use of maoto for the treatment of influenza.","publish_time":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masui, Shinta; Nabeshima, Shigeki; Ajisaka, Kazuhiko; Yamauchi, Kei; Itoh, Ryota; Ishii, Kazunari; Soejima, Toshinori; Hiromatsu, Kenji","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a00f7c5a0cfb0b083ba29ea141ddb78e942b6aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5585631.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1062065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maoto results","effect of maoto","treatment of influenza","clinical use of maoto","blocking influenza virus entry","seasonal influenza","virus titers","uncoating of influenza viruses","number of virus particles","hr culture","V-ATPase","culture supernatant","Proliferation of viral RNA","inhibition of V","infected cells","intracellular viral proteins","inhibition of endosomal acidification","endosomal pH","entry step","present study","A549 cells","traditional herbal medicine","virological efficacy","cytoplasm","vacuolar-type H","evidence","randomized controlled trials","increase","H3N2","H1N1pdm","endosomes","culturing system","PR8","subtypes","early phase","membrane"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A framework was developed to select farms for surveillance based on a risk score summarizing 5 parameters. The proposed framework was validated using data from the bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) surveillance programme in 2013. RESULTS: A cumulative score was calculated per farm, including the following parameters; the maximum monthly ingoing contact chain (in 2012), the average number of animals per incoming movement, use of mixed alpine pastures and the number of weeks in 2012 a farm had movements registered. The final score for the farm depended on the distribution of the parameters. Different cut offs; 50, 90, 95 and 99 %, were explored. The final scores ranged between 0 and 5. Validation of the scores against results from the BVD surveillance programme 2013 gave promising results for setting the cut off for each of the five selected farm level criteria at the 50th percentile. Restricting testing to farms with a score \u2265 2 would have resulted in the same number of detected BVD positive farms as testing all farms, i.e., the outcome of the 2013 surveillance programme could have been reached with a smaller survey. CONCLUSIONS: The seasonality and time dependency of the activity of single farms in the networks requires a careful assessment of the actual time period included to determine farm level criteria. However, selecting farms in the sample for risk-based surveillance can be optimized with the proposed scoring system. The system was validated using data from the BVD eradication program. The proposed method is a promising framework for the selection of farms according to the risk of infection based on animal movements.","publish_time":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00E4rrer, Sara; Widgren, Stefan; Schwermer, Heinzpeter; Lindberg, Ann; Vidondo, Beatriz; Zinsstag, Jakob; Reist, Martin","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d135acb9011d47a0f0d9e2b6542cb86539042fdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4499910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0468-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVD"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["risk score","BVD surveillance programme","farm-level parameters","risk-based surveillance systems","selection of farms","animal movements","number of detected BVD positive farms","risk of infection","activity of single farms","selected farm level criteria","proposed framework","following parameters","promising results","promising framework","cumulative score","important risk pathway","descriptive analysis of cattle movements","number of weeks","data","BVD eradication program","proposed method","proposed scoring system","final scores","testing","average number of animals","time dependency","actual time period","Different cut offs","diseases","Switzerland","incoming movement","careful assessment","bovine viral diarrhoea","maximum monthly ingoing contact chain","mixed alpine pastures","networks","seasonality","sample","study","CONCLUSIONS","percentile","outcome","Validation","distribution","smaller survey","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

These machineries govern all the different steps of mRNA maturation, from gene transcription and pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus to the export of the mRNA to the cytoplasm and its translation. In particular, the pre-mRNA splicing process consists in the joining together of sequences (known as \u201Cexons\u201D) that have to be differentiated from their intervening sequences commonly referred to as \u201Cintrons.\u201D The complex required to perform this process is a very dynamic macromolecular ribonucleoprotein assembly that functions as an enzyme, and is called the \u201Cspliceosome.\u201D Because of its flexibility, the splicing process represents one of the main mechanisms of qualitative and quantitative regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. This flexibility is mainly due to the possibility of alternatively recognizing the various exons that are present in a pre-mRNA molecule and therefore enabling the possibility of obtaining multiple transcripts from the same gene. However, regulation of gene expression by the spliceosome is also achieved through its ability to influence many other gene expression steps that include transcription, mRNA export, mRNA stability, and even protein translation. Therefore, from a biotechnological point of view the splicing process can be exploited to improve production strategies and processes of molecules of interest. In this work, we have aimed to provide an overview on how biotechnology applications may benefit from the introduction of introns within a sequence of interest.","publish_time":"2011-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skoko, Natasa; Baralle, Marco; Tisminetzky, Sergio; Buratti, Emanuele","journal":"Mol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/773d489b83185184170aaca79a22e43958fe31b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090800.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12033-011-9390-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21387124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA export","mRNA stability","gene transcription","gene expression steps","Eukaryotic gene expression","pre-mRNA processing","pre-mRNA molecule","splicing process","quantitative regulation of gene expression","different steps of mRNA maturation","possibility","spliceosome","flexibility","complex molecular machineries","eukaryotic genomes","various exons","protein translation","introduction of introns","intervening sequences","main mechanisms of qualitative","dynamic macromolecular ribonucleoprotein assembly","functions","nucleus","production strategies","biotechnology applications","processes of molecules","enzyme","multiple transcripts","biotechnological point","cytoplasm","joining","overview","coordinated fashion","work"],"language":"en"},

It also made a prediction based on the reported and extrapolated into the future by forecasting the trend. Finally, the study assessed contributions of various risk factors in the reported cases. The motivation for this study is that MERS-CoV remains among the list of blueprint priority and potential pandemic diseases globally. Yet, there is a paucity of empirical literature examining trends and seasonality as the available evidence is generally descriptive and anecdotal. The study is a time series analysis using monthly global reported cases of MERS-CoV by the World Health Organisation between January 2015 and January 2018. We decomposed the series into seasonal, irregular and trend components and identified patterns, smoothened series, generated predictions and employed forecasting techniques based on linear regression. We assessed contributions of various risk factors in MERS-CoV cases over time. Successive months of the MERS-CoV cases suggest a significant decreasing trend (P = 0.026 for monthly series and P = 0.047 for Quarterly series). The MERS-CoV cases are forecast to wane by end 2018. Seasonality component of the cases oscillated below or above the baseline (the centred moving average), but no association with the series over time was noted. The results revealed contributions of risk factors such as camel contact, male, old age and being from Saudi Arabia and Middle East regions to the overall reported cases of MERS-CoV. The trend component and several risk factors for global MERS-CoV cases, including camel contact, male, age and geography/region significantly affected the series. Our statistical models appear to suggest significant predictive capacity and the findings may well inform healthcare practitioners and policymakers about the underlying dynamics that produced the globally reported MERS-CoV cases.","publish_time":"2018-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Da\u0027ar, Omar B.; Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"Epidemiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d0b9a93533e0fe81e118dc07d73ece069a8ccff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113021.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886854/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268818001541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["global MERS-CoV cases","overall reported cases of MERS","monthly global reported cases of MERS","monthly series","seasonal variations of monthly global reported cases","smoothened series","Quarterly series","study","contributions of risk factors","time series analysis","contributions of various risk factors","trend components","significant decreasing trend","camel contact","male","trends","Seasonality component","Middle East regions","old age","forecasting techniques","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","significant predictive capacity","patterns","Saudi Arabia","generated predictions","list of blueprint priority","findings","available evidence","geography","potential pandemic diseases","healthcare practitioners","policymakers","underlying dynamics","baseline","association","centred moving average","paucity of empirical literature","World Health Organisation","statistical models","Successive months","linear regression","results","future","motivation"],"language":"en"},

A novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, was identified as the etiological agent of the disease. SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) in Escherichia coli and Vero cells, and then characterized the in vitro trans-cleavage and the cell-based cis-cleavage by the 3CL(pro). Mutational analysis of the 3CL(pro) demonstrated the importance of His41, Cys145, and Glu166 in the substrate-binding subsite S1 for keeping the proteolytic activity. In addition, alanine substitution of the cleavage substrates indicated that Gln-(P1) in the substrates mainly determined the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, this study not only established the quantifiable and reliable assay for the in vitro and cell-based measurement of the 3CL(pro) activity, but also characterized the molecular interaction of the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) with the substrates.

We have demonstrated that RNA recombination can give rise to a new viral population, supported by the finding that most isolated Taiwanese (TW) IBVs, similar to Chinese (CH) IBVs, exhibit a genetic rearrangement with the American (US) IBV at the 5\u2019 end of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Here, we further show that positive selection has occurred at two sites within the putative crossover region of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the TW IBV N protein. Based on the crystal structure of the NTD, the stereographic positions of both predicted selected sites do not fall close to the RNA-binding groove. Surprisingly, converting either of the two residues to the amino acid present in most CH IBVs resulted in significantly reduced affinity of the N protein for the synthetic RNA repeats of the viral transcriptional regulatory sequence. These results suggest that modulating the amino acid residue at either selected site may alter the conformation of the N protein and affect the viral RNA\u2013N interaction. This study illustrates that the N protein of the current TW IBV variant has been shaped by both RNA recombination and positive selection and that the latter may promote viral survival and fitness, potentially by increasing the RNA-binding capacity of the N protein.","publish_time":"2013-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Shu-Ming; Kao, Hsiao-Wei; Hou, Ming-Hon; Wang, Ching-Ho; Lin, Siou-Hong; Su, Hong-Lin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8fb632f4ff27bdc0198948414531648b0b0433d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117379.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512005597; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512005597; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23159091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TW IBV N","TW IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","TW IBV N protein","N interaction","Abstract RNA recombination","N-terminal domain","RNA-binding capacity","RNA-binding groove","synthetic RNA repeats","CH IBVs","viral survival","new viral population","current TW IBV variant","NTD","selected sites","positive selection","viral transcriptional regulatory sequence","amino acid present","amino acid residue","sporadic emergence of new variants of coronavirus","finding","putative crossover region","Chinese","rise","reduced affinity","genetic rearrangement","stereographic positions","isolated Taiwanese","infectious bronchitis virus","conformation","residues","nucleocapsid","fitness","end","contagious avian pathogen","crystal structure","results","study"],"language":"en"},

This paper reviews some of the broader impacts of mass gatherings, the opportunity for concerted action across policy sectors and scientific disciplines offered by the year 2015 (including through the Sendai Framework), and the elements of a 21st century approach to mass gatherings.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aitsi-Selmi, Amina; Murray, Virginia; Heymann, David; McCloskey, Brian; Azhar, Esam I.; Petersen, Eskild; Zumla, Alimuddin; Dar, Osman","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/891658cdeab4f19b35cd2c71fd06df1ce69d35fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110506.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310190; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27062983/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["broader impacts of mass gatherings","Summary Mass gatherings of people","numerous health hazards","management of different hazards","single hazards","Sendai Framework","comprehensive risk management","Disaster Risk Reduction","century approach","forms of disaster","global health systems","evidence-based approach","concerted action","opportunity","sporting events","religious pilgrimages","policy sectors","physical injuries","scientific disciplines","transmission of infectious diseases","environment","levels of exposure","product","related disasters","prevention","population","vulnerability","multisectoral","services","elements","paper reviews","year","all-hazard","response"],"language":"en"},

FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 102to 1016particles/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week\u0027s time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter. The infection rate only increased from 11 to 15% in 1 week.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, N.

Such discontinuous transcription is unique yet poorly understood for arterivirus. The utilization of transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) remains a puzzle, as many TRS-like sequences exist in viral genome, yet only six or seven sg mRNAs were transcribed in arterivirus infected cells. To investigate the transcriptional control of the porcine arterivirus, a recombinant PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pCPV expressing the capsid gene of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) between PRRSV ORF1b and ORF2a was developed. The rescued recombinant viruses contained a range of disparate deletions of the inserted PCV2 sequence, yet two stable recombinant viruses containing 41 and 275nt of foreign sequences were generated upon plaque purification and serial passages. Further analysis of the sg RNA2 profile revealed that an array of novel sg RNA species was generated in cells infected with the recombinant virus. One group was formed by utilizing the inserted PCV2 sequence as TRS; another group was generated from cryptic TRS-like PRRSV sequences located 19, 37 and 97nt immediately downstream of the PRRSV ORF2 AUG. These results demonstrated that (1) the recombinant virus from direct insertion of foreign sequences was genetically unstable, while two recombinant PRRSVs containing foreign sequence of 41 or 275nt in length, respectively, became stable upon plaque purification and further serial passages; (2) PRRSV can utilize foreign TRS-like sequence as transcriptional promoter; (3) the insertion of foreign sequence provoked the generation of novel subgenomic RNAs utilizing cryptic TRS-like sequences that remain non-functional in native PRRSV.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Haihong; Sun, Zhi; Zhu, Xing-Quan; Long, Jinxue; Lu, Jiaqi; Lv, Jian; Yuan, Shishan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dc343d9d9c2d8c78ac1b2f0c0a9c188cb1e671d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951727/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170209004158; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170209004158; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.11.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRS","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV sequences","foreign TRS","nt of foreign sequences","cryptic TRS","PRRSV ORF2","PRRSV ORF1b","native PRRSV","inserted PCV2 sequence","recombinant PRRSVs","stable recombinant viruses","direct insertion of foreign sequences","porcine arterivirus","rescued recombinant viruses","sg mRNAs","recombinant PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pCPV","arterivirus infected cells","plaque purification","sg RNA2 profile","serial passages","group","array of novel sg RNA species","respiratory syndrome virus","generation of novel subgenomic RNAs","capsid gene of porcine circovirus","transcriptional promoter","transcriptional control","discontinuous transcription","utilization of transcription","set of nested subgenomic","range of disparate deletions","genes","analysis","ORF2a","puzzle","viral genome","results","length"],"language":"en"},

We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion. Novel 2019-nCoV sequences revealed the evolution and specificity of betacoronavirus with possible mechanisms of enhanced infectivity.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Aiping; Niu, Peihua; Wang, Lulan; Zhou, Hangyu; Zhao, Xiang; Wang, Wenling; Wang, Jingfeng; Ji, Chengyang; Ding, Xiao; Wang, Xianyue; Lu, Roujian; Gold, Sarah; Aliyari, Saba; Zhang, Shilei; Vikram, Ellee; Zou, Angela; Lenh, Emily; Chen, Janet; Ye, Fei; Han, Na; Peng, Yousong; Guo, Haitao; Wu, Guizhen; Jiang, Taijiao; Tan, Wenjie; Cheng, Genhong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af38c3a76c8192e661b682aa85e019feefc4a58a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2ea102f58147dab02e4dea90eb90dbc67149f678.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.971101","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV sequences","nCoV strains","nCoV relative","genomic sequences","bat SARS-CoV","molecular evolution","MERS-CoV","receptor binding regions","available genome sequences","potential recombination","receptor binding domain recombination","cleavage site insertion","different regions","comprehensive analysis","novel genomes","novel coronavirus","different receptor entry specificities","TMPRSS2 cleavage site","distinct SNPs markers","potential furin","distinct groups","specificity of betacoronavirus","possible mechanisms of enhanced infectivity","mechanisms responsible","comprehensive insights","Systematic analysis","amino acid insertion","overall genome structures","multiple inheritable SNPs","S1","S2 domains","genetic subgroups","spike protein","infection","co-circulation","patients","pathways","China","countries","studies","evidence","coronaviruses","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

In SAON rats, 50 mg/kg Mg, or 100 mg/kg VC, or combination, or water control was orally supplemented daily for 2 or 6 weeks respectively. Osteonecrosis was evaluated by histology. Serum Mg, VC, and bone turnover markers were measured. Microfil-perfused samples prepared for angiography and trabecular architecture were evaluated by micro-CT. Primary bone marrow cells were isolated from each group to evaluate their potentials in osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. The mechanisms were tested in vitro. Histological evaluation showed SAON lesions in steroid treated groups. Mg and VC supplementation synergistically reduced the apoptosis of osteocytes and osteoclast number, and increased osteoblast surface. VC supplementation significantly increased the bone formation marker PINP, and the combination significantly decreased the bone resorption marker CTX. TNF\u03B1 expression and oxidative injury were decreased in bone marrow in Mg/VC/combination group. Mg significantly increased the blood perfusion in proximal tibia and decreased the leakage particles in distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. VC significantly elevated the osteoblast differentiation potential of marrow cells and improved the trabecular architecture. The combination supplementation significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation potential of marrow cells. In vitro study showed promoting osteoblast differentiation effect of VC, and anti-inflammation and promoting angiogenesis effect of Mg with underlying mechanisms. Mg and VC supplementation could synergistically alleviate SAON in rats, indicating great translational potentials of metallic minerals for preventing SAON.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Li-Zhen; Wang, Jia-Li; Xu, Jian-Kun; Zhang, Xiao-Tian; Liu, Bao-Yi; Huang, Le; Zhang, Ri; Zu, Hai-Yue; He, Xuan; Mi, Jie; Pang, Qian-Qian; Wang, Xin-Luan; Ruan, Ye-Chun; Zhao, De-Wei; Qin, Ling","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79db3ad22434b309c81d5495d0f9399722593181.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185815.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.119828; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961220300740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961220300740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32045781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osteonecrosis"],"organizations":["SAON","VC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VC supplementation","combination supplementation","SAON rats","promoting osteoblast differentiation effect of VC","SAON lesions","SAON induction","Primary bone marrow cells","osteoblast differentiation potential of marrow cells","combination group","inhibited osteoclast differentiation potential of marrow cells","effect of magnesium","underlying mechanisms","bone turnover markers","increased osteoblast surface","bone formation marker PINP","bone resorption marker CTX","angiogenesis effect","underlying anabolic mechanisms","trabecular architecture","weeks","steroid-associated osteonecrosis","osteoclast number","distal tibia","proximal tibia","clinical applications","present study","steroid treated groups","relevant clinical disorders","great translational potentials of metallic minerals","biodegradability","leakage particles","tissue regeneration","beneficial biological effects","angiography","orthopaedics","oxidative injury","apoptosis of osteocytes","Histological evaluation","Microfil-perfused samples","based biometal","inflammation","vitamin C","rat experimental model","TNF\u03B1 expression","blood perfusion","osteoblastogenesis","water control","osteoclastogenesis","Serum","histology"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. RESULTS: In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group vs. 2/37 (5.4%) vs. (3/244 (1.2%), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20%) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6%).

Excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Numerous studies link apolipoprotein D (apoD), a secreted glycoprotein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), to maintain and protect neurons in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. Here, we used a mouse model overexpressing human apoD in neurons (H-apoD Tg) to test the neuroprotective effects of apoD in the kainic acid (KA)-lesioned hippocampus. Our results show that apoD overexpression in H-apoD Tg mice induces an increased resistance to KA-induced seizures, significantly attenuates inflammatory responses and confers protection against KA-induced cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. The apoD-mediated protection against KA-induced toxicity is imputable in part to increased plasma membrane Ca2\u002B ATPase type 2 expression (1.7-fold), decreased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B levels (30 %) and lipid metabolism alterations. Indeed, we demonstrate that apoD can attenuate intracellular cholesterol content in primary hippocampal neurons and in brain of H-apoD Tg mice. In addition, apoD can be internalised by neurons and this internalisation is accentuated in ageing and injury conditions. Our results provide additional mechanistic information on the apoD-mediated neuroprotection in neurodegenerative conditions.","publish_time":"2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Najyb, Ouafa; Do Carmo, Sonia; Alikashani, Azadeh; Rassart, Eric","journal":"Mol Neurobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e65838298bf62e2e0ac31630f6bf6a7de47444f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-016-9920-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoD overexpression","human apoD","apoD-mediated protection","H-apoD Tg mice","apoD-mediated neuroprotection","neuroprotective effects of apoD","KA-induced seizures","KA-induced toxicity","KA-induced cell apoptosis","brain of H","primary hippocampal neurons","neurodegenerative conditions","results","Excitotoxicity","increased resistance","lesioned hippocampus","injury conditions","d-aspartate receptor","myriad of neurodegenerative diseases","various mouse models of acute stress","Numerous studies link apolipoprotein D","distinct etiologies","NMDAR","intracellular cholesterol content","kainic acid","ATPase type","plasma membrane Ca2","fold","subunit NR2B levels","excessive activation of glutamatergic receptors","decreased N-methyl","additional mechanistic information","inflammatory responses","neuronal dysfunction","central nervous system","Alzheimer\u2019s","neurodegeneration","pathogenesis","secreted glycoprotein","CNS","death","Parkinson\u2019s","ageing","internalisation","lipid metabolism alterations"],"language":"en"},

An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older. The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria. FINDINGS: Between Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66 752 adults were recruited to the study population. The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13\u00B76% (95% CI 12\u00B70\u201315\u00B72). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19\u00B70%, 95% CI 16\u00B79\u201321\u00B72 vs 8\u00B71%, 6\u00B78\u20139\u00B73; p\u003C0\u00B70001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 58\u00B72% vs 4\u00B70%). The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20\u00B72%, 95% CI 14\u00B77\u201325\u00B78) and the lowest in central China (10\u00B72%, 8\u00B72\u201312\u00B72). Among adults with COPD, 56\u00B74% (95% CI 53\u00B77\u201359\u00B72) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36\u00B73% (34\u00B73\u201338\u00B73) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6\u00B75% (5\u00B75\u20137\u00B74) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0\u00B79% (0\u00B76\u20131\u00B71) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV). INTERPRETATION: In a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 2014\u201315 was 13\u00B76%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem.

Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion. We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Manish; Taki, Kaling; Gahlot, Rohit; Sharma, Ayushi; Dhangar, Kiran","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e68aa5b4c66bc3b9ab001b19c35c084a31a2f1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720327959; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720327959?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Prognosis of COVID","proper COVID","diagnosis of COVID","various aspects of SARS","progression of SARS","pedigree of SARS","chronicle of SARS","right information","life-threatening pandemic of COVID","dissemination of information","useful information","underlying mechanism of SARS","various sources","Infection","order","various body organs","binding of S protein","transmission route","community workers","scientific community","published research","comprehensive review","S protein-initiated membrane fusion","airborne-based transmission","future research perspectives","robust understanding of right strategical steps","lockdown","virus transmissions","influence of environmental factors","news","reports","pathogenesis","symptoms","unseen precedent of social distancing","epidemiology","genome","Vero-hSLAM cells","coronavirus disease","Respiratory droplet size","numerous daily publications","challenges","scope","effects","AE2","Ivermectin","established relationship","Nafamostat mesylate","urgency","days","topic","Hydroxychloroquine","facts","management","temperature","time","Abstract","findings","Coronaviruses","humidity"],"language":"en"},

Among their applications in food preservation, peptides have been incorporated into packaging materials. This review begins with a brief description of the methods used for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides. Also, the main bioproperties and mechanisms of action of peptides are discussed. Finally, some applications of peptides are presented, especially their use in active packaging, their effects on the polymeric matrix, and peptide migration.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez Espitia, Paula Judith; de F\u00E1tima Ferreira Soares, Nilda; dos Reis Coimbra, Jane S\u00E9lia; de Andrade, N\u00E9lio Jos\u00E9; Souza Cruz, Renato; Alves Medeiros, Eber Antonio","journal":"Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86d8f270a4c5b55d3d890f4a41ec43a6412e9d38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194098.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00179.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["applications of peptides","Bioactive peptides","characterization of peptides","useful properties","active packaging","packaging materials","antifungal","protein fragments","functions","positive impact","effects","human health","polymeric matrix","methods","antiviral","purification","mechanisms of action","conditions of living beings","main bioproperties","brief description","synthesis","peptide migration","antitumor activities","various areas","researchers","food preservation","limited quantities","nature","review","species of life","compounds","result"],"language":"en"},

Neonatal calves are particularly sensitive to infections with enteropathogens. The present study focused on prevention against the main infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea i.e. Escherichia coli, rota- and coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Dairy herds (n =24) with a high percentage of neonatal calves scouring (\u003E10%) were included and calves were sampled for the presence of these four enteropathogens. To decrease diarrhoea problems among neonatal calves, a standard protocol was tested on 13 herds (treatment group) where both C. parvum and either E. coli or rota- or coronavirus were identified as being involved, the other 11 herds served as control group. The protocol consisted of 2 points of action: preventive vaccination of dams against E. coli, rota- and coronavirus, and preventive administration of halofuginone lactate to newborn calves. The average percentage of calves suffering from neonatal diarrhoea (39.7% versus 14.3%, P \u003C0.01) and the average percentage of faecal samples positive for C. parvum (34% versus 11%, P \u003C0.05) differed significantly between control herds and treatment herds after implementation of the protocol. No significant differences between control and treatment group were observed in the percentage of calves excreting E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus, both before and at the end of the trial. Furthermore, risk factors potentially associated with the development of neonatal calf scours were determined. Non-significant results were obtained for the effect of the protocol on duration of diarrhoea and the effect of the colostral IgG quantity on the risk of diarrhoea. Passive immunity transfer status of the calves, measured both before the onset and at the end of the study, were non-significant between groups.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meganck, V.; Hoflack, G.; Piepers, S.; Opsomer, G.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67a0f64c9c67cfa1a964dd1aa3490583ff1081e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475689/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758771400381X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758771400381X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neonatal diarrhoea","high percentage of neonatal calves","average percentage of calves","treatment herds","newborn calves","control herds","risk of diarrhoea","coronavirus","duration of diarrhoea","diarrhoea problems","cattle herds","Dairy herds","Abstract Calf diarrhoea","main infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea","treatment group","control group","development of neonatal calf scours","Escherichia coli","standard protocol","effect","significant differences","Non-significant results","Cryptosporidium parvum","end","average percentage of faecal samples positive","present study","risk factors","preventive vaccination of dams","preventive administration of halofuginone lactate","substantial economic losses","prevention","colostral IgG quantity","implementation","points of action","Passive immunity transfer status","groups","infections","rotavirus","onset","trial","presence"],"language":"en"},

This retrospective study aimed to present clinical features of HBOV infections in children with respiratory symptoms and describe unexplained encephalopathy in a subgroup of these patients. Results of 1,143 pediatric nasal samples from mid\u2010December 2013 to July 2014 were reviewed for detection of HBOV. A multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for viral detection. Medical records of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. HBOV was detected in 30 patients (2.6%). Median age was 14 months (5\u201380). Clinical diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 10), bronchopneumonia (n = 9), acute bronchiolitis (n = 5), pneumonia (n = 4), acute bronchitis (n = 1), and asthma execarbation (n = 1). Hospitalization was required in 16 (53.3%) patients and 10 (62.5%) of them admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Noninvasive mechanical ventilation modalities was applied to four patients and mechanical ventilation to four patients. Intractable seizures developed in four patients while mechanically ventilated on the 2nd\u20133rd days of PICU admission. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. No mortality was observed, but two patients were discharged with neurological sequela. HBOV may lead to respiratory infections in a wide spectrum of severity. This report indicates its potential to cause severe respiratory infections requiring PICU admission and highlights possible clinical association of HBOV and encephalopathy, which developed during severe respiratory infection.

The multiplex assay was validated by analysing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay compared to the respective monoplex assays, and a good concordance was found. Furthermore, the enterovirus assay was able to detect 42 reference strains from all 4 species, and an additional 9 genotypes during panel testing and routine usage. During 15 months of routine use, from October 2008 to December 2009, we received and analysed 2187 samples (stool samples, cerebrospinal fluids, blood samples, respiratory samples and autopsy samples) were tested, from 1546 patients and detected enteroviruses and parechoviruses in 171 (8%) and 66 (3%) of the samples, respectively. 180 of the positive samples could be genotyped by PCR and sequencing and the most common genotypes found were human parechovirus type 3, echovirus 9, enterovirus 71, Coxsackievirus A16, and echovirus 25. During 2009 in Denmark, both enterovirus and human parechovirus type 3 had a similar seasonal pattern with a peak during the summer and autumn.

It is both a result of natural ecological system development, and also an inevitable outcome of human ecological system development within a certain stage, with the objective of identifying the possible improvement space for unban ecological security evaluation from complex system perspective. Based on the brittle structure model and set pair theory, this paper firstly explored the main research methods of urban ecological security theory and its characteristics, then conducted a theory of complex system brittleness to analyze the urban ecological security brittle factors, brittle primitives, and brittle structure. Furthermore, it conducted a model of urban ecological system brittleness correlation entropy together with a set pair analysis method to discuss its brittleness. And finally, an ecological safety evaluation has been presented based on the empirical case in Chengdu City of China. The theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the brittle correlation entropy of natural subsystem in urban ecological security is the biggest one. The risks from natural subsystem collapse can easily trigger the brittleness of the entire urban system. The corresponding maximum brittle fluctuation entropy is from economic subsystem; it has a largest impact on the entropy change of urban ecosystem. The way of reducing the uncertainty of urban ecological risks is to lower difference degree coefficient in the system. Relevant decision makers should consider to reduce the increasing degree of entropy and eliminate the fluctuation of the brittle factors. Thus, the threats or risks of urban ecological system can be within the acceptable range and under control. An integrated system management combing with brittleness characters of natural, economics, and social subsystem is necessary. It is helpful for the ecological security construction.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Xiaodong; Xiao, Zhonghai","journal":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fcec2e5ee632398fa1019c056300fdad8021e38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183819.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08713-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chengdu City","China"],"keyphrases":["risks of urban ecological system","urban ecological security brittle factors","ecological security evaluation","ecological security construction","entire urban system","model of urban ecological system brittleness correlation entropy","uncertainty of urban ecological risks","result of natural ecological system development","ecological safety evaluation","theory of complex system brittleness","main research methods of urban ecological security theory","brittle correlation entropy of natural subsystem","inevitable outcome of human ecological system development","entropy change of urban ecosystem","brittle primitives","complex system perspective","brittle structure model","brittleness characters of natural","corresponding maximum brittle fluctuation entropy","integrated system management combing","natural subsystem collapse","increasing degree of entropy","economic subsystem","pair theory","social subsystem","empirical analysis","set pair analysis method","empirical case","lower difference degree coefficient","economics","possible improvement space","certain stage","objective","paper","largest impact","characteristics","Chengdu City of China","threats","acceptable range","Relevant decision makers","control","way","attention"],"language":"en"},

In addition to un-glycosylated and glycosylated proteins, one product with smaller size initiated in-frame from the third Met residues probably through ribosomal re-initiation was also detected. Translation initiated in-frame from the third Met is unusual since the sequence around the first Met of SARS-CoV M protein contains the optimal consensus Kozak sequence. The function of this smaller translated product awaits further investigation. Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins, glycosylation of SARS-CoV M protein was occurred co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The SARS-CoV M protein is predicted as a triple-spanning membrane protein lack of a conventional signal peptide. The second and third trans-membrane regions (a.a. 46\u201368 and 78\u2013100) are predicted to be the primary type helices, which will be able to penetrate into membrane by themselves, while the first trans-membrane region (a.a. 14\u201336) is predicted to be the secondary type helix, which is considered to be stabilized by the interaction with other trans-membrane segments. As expected, the second and third trans-membrane regions were able to insert a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane more efficiently than the first one.

Although modernization based on the developments in science and technology has increased individuals\u2019 well-being and wealth, the perceived risk toward the complex technological system has increased. In a risky society, social accidents amplify the existing fear among individuals. It is generally assumed that each value, perception, and resource influences the fear of risk. However, very few studies have tested these three factors together within an integrated causal model. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the determinants that influence the perceived risk in cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a deadly epidemic disease, in Korea. Based on the theoretical model, we analyzed the survey data collected from respondents (N = 814) in Korea. After controlling for variables such as sociodemographic characteristics, we examined how three competing factors, i.e., value, perception, and resource, influence the perceived risk of MERS. The analysis showed that trust and vulnerability variables in the perception factor, health state, and perceived knowledge in the resource factor had a significant impact on the perceived risk of MERS.","publish_time":"2018-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Sunhee; Kim, Seoyong","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b6d78d18468508dd0b85bc9fc2e1b2e3079ec05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6025578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15061168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29867054/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["perceived risk of MERS","fear of risk","perceived knowledge","resource factor","perception factor","value","risky society","Korea","vulnerability variables","existing fear","competing factors","theoretical model","integrated causal model","cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","social accidents","individuals\u2019 well-being","health state","significant impact","science","technology","wealth","survey data","deadly epidemic disease","trust","determinants","complex technological system","developments","respondents","analysis","sociodemographic characteristics","present study","modernization","world","studies"],"language":"en"},

There are no licensed RSV vaccines available, and the few treatment options for high-risk individuals are either extremely costly or cause severe side effects and toxicity. Immunomodulation mediated by a novel formulation consisting of the toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly(I:C), an innate defense regulator peptide and a polyphosphazene (P-I-P) was evaluated in the context of lethal infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Intranasal delivery of a single dose of P-I-P protected adult mice against PVM when given 24 h prior to challenge. These animals experienced minimal weight loss, no clinical disease, 100% survival, and reduced lung pathology. Similar clinical outcomes were observed in mice treated up to 3 days prior to infection. P-I-P pre-treatment induced early mRNA and protein expression of key chemokine and cytokine genes, reduced the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, decreased virus titers in the lungs, and modulated the delayed exacerbated nature of PVM disease without any short-term side effects. On day 14 post-infection, P-I-P-treated mice were confirmed to be PVM-free. These results demonstrate the capacity of this formulation to prevent PVM and possibly other viral respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez, Elisa C.; Garg, Ravendra; Shrivastava, Pratima; Gomis, Susantha; van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, Sylvia","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a76f40f5ae91395a09ca16c42949b8ee9525ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126411.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303837; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.10.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27771388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","PVM","P-I-P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P-treated mice","P pre-treatment","single dose of P","PVM-free","pneumonia virus of mice","adult mice","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus","viral respiratory infections","delayed exacerbated nature of PVM disease","clinical disease","post-infection","effects","decreased virus titers","context of lethal infection","leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections","novel formulation","Similar clinical outcomes","reduced lung pathology","licensed RSV vaccines available","protein expression of key chemokine","infants","early mRNA","cytokine genes","polyphosphazene","recruitment of neutrophils","innate defense regulator peptide","toll","eosinophils","lungs","minimal weight loss","survival","treatment options","young children","agonist poly","high-risk individuals","Intranasal delivery","receptor","animals","capacity","Immunomodulation","toxicity","results","challenge","days"],"language":"en"},

While correlations between mental disorders and infections have been reported, the possible genetic links between them have not been assessed in large-scale studies. Moreover, the genetic basis of susceptibility to infection is largely unknown, as large-scale genome-wide association studies of susceptibility to infection have been lacking. We utilized a large Danish population-based sample (N = 65,534) linked to nationwide population-based registers to investigate the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection (heritability estimation, polygenic risk analysis, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS)) and examined its association with mental disorders (comorbidity analysis and genetic correlation). We found strong links between having at least one psychiatric diagnosis and the occurrence of infection (P = 2.16 \u00D7 10(\u2212208), OR = 1.72). The SNP heritability of susceptibility to infection ranged from ~2 to ~7% in samples of differing psychiatric diagnosis statuses (suggesting the environment as a major contributor to susceptibility), and polygenic risk scores moderately but significantly explained infection status in an independent sample. We observed a genetic correlation of 0.496 (P = 2.17 \u00D7 10(\u221217)) between a diagnosis of infection and a psychiatric diagnosis. While our GWAS did not identify genome-wide significant associations, we found 90 suggestive (P \u2264 10(\u22125)) associations for susceptibility to infection. Our findings suggest a genetic component in susceptibility to infection and indicate that the occurrence of infections in individuals with mental illness may be in part genetically driven.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nudel, Ron; Wang, Yunpeng; Appadurai, Vivek; Schork, Andrew J.; Buil, Alfonso; Agerbo, Esben; Bybjerg-Grauholm, Jonas; B\u00F8rglum, Anders D.; Daly, Mark J.; Mors, Ole; Hougaard, David M.; Mortensen, Preben B.; Werge, Thomas; Nordentoft, Merete; Thompson, Wesley K.; Benros, Michael E.","journal":"Transl Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a0d8474822c0a07e6a8cd805f0fbf2e17a38680.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6848113.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-019-0622-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712607/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of infection","infection status","genetic architecture of susceptibility","genetic basis of susceptibility","genetic correlation","mental disorders","genetic component","large-scale genome-wide association studies of susceptibility","SNP heritability of susceptibility","possible genetic links","genome-wide association study","mental illness","occurrence of infections","genome-wide significant associations","polygenic risk analysis","samples of differing psychiatric diagnosis statuses","GWAS","large-scale studies","polygenic risk scores","large Danish population-based sample","comorbidity analysis","heritability estimation","nationwide population-based registers","major contributor","independent sample","strong links","major global disease burdens","environment","individuals","findings","correlations"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine the potential of thin-section computed tomography (CT) in differentiating bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. Patients and methods Thin-section CT studies were prospectively examined in hospitalized CAP patients within 2 days of admission, followed by retrospective assessment by two pulmonary radiologists. Thin-section CT findings on the pneumonias caused by each pathogen were examined, and two types of pneumonias were compared. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced. Results Among 183 CAP episodes (181 patients, 125 men and 56 women, mean age\u00B1S.D.: 61.1\u00B119.7) examined by thin-section CT, the etiologies of 125 were confirmed (94 bacterial pneumonia and 31 non-bacterial pneumonia). Centrilobular nodules were specific for non-bacterial pneumonia and airspace nodules were specific for bacterial pneumonia (specificities of 89% and 94%, respectively) when located in the outer lung areas. When centrilobular nodules were the principal finding, they were specific but lacked sensitivity for non-bacterial pneumonia (specificity 98% and sensitivity 23%). To distinguish the two types of pneumonias, centrilobular nodules, airspace nodules and lobular shadows were found to be important by multivariate analyses. ROC curve analysis discriminated bacterial pneumonia from non-bacterial pneumonia among patients without underlying lung diseases, yielding an optimal point with sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 79%, respectively, but was less effective when all patients were analyzed together (70% and 84%, respectively). Conclusion Thin-section CT examination was applied for the differentiation of bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonias. Though showing some potential, this examination at the present time would not be applicable for patients with underlying lung diseases, severe conditions of pneumonia, or immunocompromised conditions.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ito, Isao; Ishida, Tadashi; Togashi, Kaori; Niimi, Akio; Koyama, Hiroshi; Ishimori, Takayoshi; Kobayashi, Hisataka; Mishima, Michiaki","journal":"European Journal of Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad756fd3d23c54c918f5e5fc991709e2aac5442b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127011.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X08004610; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X08004610; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2008.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18835120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-bacterial pneumonias","severe conditions of pneumonia","Centrilobular nodules","section CT examination","section CT studies","section CT findings","airspace nodules","hospitalized CAP patients","differentiation of bacterial","types of pneumonias","sensitivity","underlying lung diseases","multivariate analyses","CAP episodes","specificity","objective","potential","outer lung areas","immunocompromised conditions","multivariate logistic regression analyses","ROC curve analysis","receiver","characteristic","optimal point","lobular shadows","days of admission","management of community","retrospective assessment","women","present time","principal finding","methods","tomography","Abstract Background","pulmonary radiologists","mean age","curves","Conclusion","specificities","identification","causative agents","Results","study","pathogen","etiologies"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To determine whether HRVC-QCE was a distinct HRV-C strain, by determining its genome and prevalence, by cataloguing genomic features for strain discrimination and by observing clinical features in positive patients. Study design Novel real-time RT-PCRs and retrospective chart reviews were used to investigate a well-defined population of 1247 specimen extracts to observe the prevalence and the clinical features of each HRV-QCE positive case from an in- and out-patient pediatric, hospital-based population during 2003. An objective illness severity score was determined for each HRVC-QCE positive patient. Results Differences in overall polyprotein and VP1 binding pocket residues and the predicted presence of a cis-acting replication element in 1B defined HRVC-QCE as a novel HRV-C strain. Twelve additional HRVC-QCE detections (1.0% prevalence) occurred among infants and toddlers (1\u201324 months) suffering mild to moderate illness, including fever and cough, who were often hospitalized. HRVC-QCE was frequently detected in the absence of another virus and was the only virus detected in three (23% of HRVC-QCE positives) children with asthma exacerbation and in two (15%) toddlers with febrile convulsion. Conclusions HRVC-QCE is a newly identified, genetically distinct HRV strain detected in hospitalized children with a range of clinical features. HRV strains should be independently considered to ensure we do not overestimate the HRVs in asymptomatic illness.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arden, K. E.; Faux, C.

New viral respiratory tract infections with epidemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine-origin influenza A H1N1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, require development of new antiviral agents. The substantial rise in the global numbers of patients with respiratory tract infections caused by pan-antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and multiazole-resistant fungi has focused attention on investments into development of new drugs and treatment regimens. Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings will necessitate rapid, precise diagnosis and more effective and pathogen-specific therapies.

This mechanism is primarily composed of three transmembrane proteins serving as stress sensors: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). These three proteins\u2019 synergic action elicits translation and transcriptional downstream pathways, leading to less protein production and activating genes that encode important proteins in folding processes, including chaperones. Previous reports showed that viruses have evolved mechanisms to curtail or customize this UPR signaling for their own benefit. However, HIV infection\u2019s effect on the UPR has scarcely been investigated. METHODS: This work investigated UPR modulation by HIV infection by assessing UPR-related protein expression under in vitro and in vivo conditions via Western blotting. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs\u2019 influence on this stress response was also considered. RESULTS: In in vitro and in vivo analyses, our results confirm that HIV infection activates stress-response components and that ARV therapy contributes to changes in the UPR\u2019s activation profile. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing UPR-related protein expression in HIV target cells derived directly from HIV-infected patients receiving different ARV therapies. Thus, two mechanisms may occur simultaneously: interference by HIV itself and the ARV drugs\u2019 pharmacological effects as UPR activators. New evidence of how HIV modulates the UPR to enhance its own replication and secure infection success is also presented.

This study aims to describe the viral etiologies, the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of children under two years of age who were hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), focusing on RSV (prevalence, seasonality, subgroups, viral load) and its association with disease severity. METHODS: A prospective study among children under two years of age, hospitalized with LRTI was conducted in two referral pediatric hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from May 2009 to December 2010. Socio-demographic, clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected on enrolment and discharge. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR (13 viruses) and quantitative RSV RT-PCR were used to identify viral pathogens, RSV load and subgroups. RESULTS: Among 632 cases, 48% were RSV positive. RSV infections occurred at younger age than three other leading viral infections i.e rhinovirus (RV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV-3) and were significantly more frequent in the first 6 months of life. Clinical severity score of RSV infection was significantly higher than PIV-3 but not for RV or MPV. In multivariate analysis, RV infection was significantly associated with severity while RSV infection was not. Among RSV infections, neither viral load nor viral co-infections were significantly associated with severity. Young age and having fever at admission were significantly associated with both RSV and LRTI severity. A shift in RSV subgroup predominance was observed during two consecutive rainy seasons but was not associated with severity. CONCLUSION: We report etiologies, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of LRTI among hospitalized children under two years of age and risk factors of RSV and LRTI severity.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Do, Lien Anh Ha; Bryant, Juliet E.; Tran, Anh Tuan; Nguyen, Bach Hue; Tran, Thi Thu Loan; Tran, Quynh Huong; Vo, Quoc Bao; Tran Dac, Nguyen Anh; Trinh, Hong Nhien; Nguyen, Thi Thanh Hai; Le Binh, Bao Tinh; Le, Khanh; Nguyen, Minh Tien; Thai, Quang Tung; Vo, Thanh Vu; Ngo, Ngoc Quang Minh; Dang, Thi Kim Huyen; Cao, Ngoc Huong; Tran, Thu Van; Ho, Lu Viet; Farrar, Jeremy; de Jong, Menno; van Doorn, H.

Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy, but also facilitate research in epidemiology, genetics and virology. This information, in turn, could significantly aid clinicians in battling viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiselev, Daniel; Matsvay, Alina; Abramov, Ivan; Dedkov, Vladimir; Shipulin, German; Khafizov, Kamil","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bf6368f164189524748aa07f1a42fe808841b64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074965/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020211","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTS","Conventional clinical tests","data analysis","limited data","molecular diagnostics of viral infections","daily clinical practice","universal protocols","library preparation","high cost","diagnostic tool","complexity of sample preparation","reliable diagnostic methods","high throughput sequencing","future gold standard","needs","research","financial abilities of modern healthcare centers","PCR","serology","epidemiology","genetics","virology","profiling pathogens","clinicians","computational infrastructure","correct therapy","purpose-specific pipelines","Viruses","alarming rate","turn","cutting-edge therapies","information","obstacles","objectives"],"language":"en"},

More than 1 in 2,000 units were recalled in the late 1990s in the United States. The most common reason for these notices from donor centers is postdonation donor information. Most of these units had been transfused, and many present a \u201Crisk of a risk\u201D (ie, a problem might have been present that might have affected the recipient). A few regulations and standards address recalls in general terms, but transfusion services generally have wide discretion in the management of specific common recall problems. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now including posttransfusion evaluations in its guidelines for emerging infectious threats to the blood supply. We suggest that hospital transfusion services should have standard operating procedures for managing recalls and that the hospital transfusion committee and the quality management program should provide local input or oversight. Using the FDA\u2019s categories of donor center biological product deviations, we provide recommendations to consider for when to notify the recipient\u2019s physician, after postdonation information is received about a previously transfused blood component.

The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingness-to-pay were calculated. Results A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%). The median and mean amount subjects reported being willing to pay for a SARS vaccine was US $1762 and US $720, respectively. Subject responses were significantly related to the price of vaccination and their type of job.

Material and Methods: Data were collected from patients attending the Urology emergency ward of CHUP during three weeks - from March 11th 2020 to April 1st 2020 - and from the same period the previous year (from March 11th to April 1st 2019). Results: During the pandemic, 46.4% fewer patients visited our urological ED (122 vs 263). There was no significant difference of the mean age or the number of old patients (with 65 or more years old) between the two periods. However, significantly fewer female patients sought emergency urological services during the COVID-19 pandemic period (32.7% vs. 14.8%, p\u003C0.05). No significant differences were noted between different clinical severity groups under the MTS. In 2019, significantly less patients required hospitalization. The most common reasons for admission, during both periods, were hematuria, renal colic and urinary tract infections (UTI). The authors recognize that the study has several limitations, namely, those inherent to its retrospective nature. Conclusion: COVID-19 significantly influenced people\u2019s urological care-seeking behaviour. Based on the results of this study, we have reasons to speculate that people\u2019s requirements for urological services might grow explosively in the post-COVID-19 period. There should be further studies about the real state of long-term urological services and the consequences that this pandemic may have in terms of morbimortality not directly related to the virus.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madanelo, M; Ferreira, C; Rocha, MA; Nunes-Carneiro, D; Correia, J; Teixeira, B; Mendes, G; Tavares, C; Pinto, A; Mesquita, S; Fraga, A","journal":"Actas Urol Esp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/152f7ea9609b5fb2689317228a3c3e923334986c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210480620301091; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210480620301091?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2020.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Porto","MTS."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of patients","fewer patients","pandemic period","emergency urological services","urological ED","female patients","number of old patients","people\u2019s urological care","equivalent period","real state of long-term urological services","Urology emergency ward of CHUP","emergency surgery","admission","periods","common reasons","post-COVID","hospitalization","study","Results","different clinical severity groups","people\u2019s requirements","significant differences","years old","Urology ED of Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00E1rio","renal colic","urinary tract infections","mean age","hematuria","Manchester triage system","Porto","MTS","UTI","need","consequences","studies","Methods","Data","demographic characteristics","weeks","behaviour","terms of morbimortality","retrospective nature","Material","limitations","ABSTRACT Objectives","previous year","vs","virus","authors","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Despite clinical evidence for anti-tumor activity, its efficacy as a stand-alone therapy remains to be improved. The success of future trials can be greatly influenced by the identification and the regulation of the cellular pathways that are important for reovirus replication and oncolysis. Here, we demonstrate that reovirus induces autophagy in several cell lines, evident from the formation of Atg5-Atg12 complexes, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, p62 degradation, the appearance of acidic vesicular organelles, and LC3 puncta. Furthermore, in electron microscopic images of reovirus-infected cells, autophagosomes were observed without evident association with viral factories. Using UV-inactivated reovirus, we demonstrate that a productive reovirus infection facilitates the induction of autophagy. Importantly, knock-out cell lines for specific autophagy-related genes revealed that the expression of Atg3 and Atg5 but not Atg13 facilitates reovirus replication.

In this research, the first resolved COVID-19 crystal structure (main protease) was targeted in a virtual screening study by of FDA approved drugs dataset. In addition, a knowledge gap in relations of COVID-19 with the previously known fatal Coronaviruses (CoVs) epidemics, SARS and MERS CoVs, was covered by investigation of sequence statistics and phylogenetics. Materials and methods Molecular modeling, virtual screening, docking, sequence comparison statistics and phylogenetics of the COVID-19 main protease were investigated. Key findings COVID-19 Mpro formed a phylogenetic group with SARS CoV that was distant from MERS CoV. The identity% was 96.061 and 51.61 for COVID-19/SARS and COVID-19/MERS CoV sequence comparisons, respectively. The top 20 drugs in the virtual screening studies comprised a broad-spectrum antiviral (ribavirin), anti-hepatitis B virus (telbivudine), two vitamins (vitamin B12 and nicotinamide) and other miscellaneous systemically acting drugs. Of special interest, ribavirin had been used in treating cases of SARS CoV. Significance The present study provided a comprehensive targeting of the first resolved COVID\u002B19 structure of Mpro and found a suitable save drugs for repurposing against the viral Mpro. Ribavirin, telbivudine, vitamin B12 and nicotinamide can be combined and used for COVID treatment.

Virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification, and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses. Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis\u2014rabies. The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest. Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health. Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest purely through their classification within the lyssavirus genus alongside the rabies virus. Although the rabies virus is principally transmitted from the bite of infected dogs, these related lyssaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans and terrestrial carnivores by bats. Even though reports of zoonotic viruses from bats within the EU are rare, to protect human and animal health, it is important characterise novel bat viruses for several reasons, namely: (i) to investigate the mechanisms for the maintenance, potential routes of transmission, and resulting clinical signs, if any, in their natural hosts; (ii) to investigate the ability of existing vaccines, where available, to protect against these viruses; (iii) to evaluate the potential for spill over and onward transmission of viral pathogens in novel terrestrial hosts. This review is an update on the current situation regarding zoonotic virus discovery within bats in the EU, and provides details of potential future mechanisms to control the threat from these deadly pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shipley, Rebecca; Wright, Edward; Selden, David; Wu, Guanghui; Aegerter, James; Fooks, Anthony R; Banyard, Ashley C","journal":"Trop Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9448084d08566af7477c4611211d1072159b6127.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6473451.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed4010031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rabies virus","zoonotic virus discovery","novel bat viruses","EU","free of terrestrial rabies","terrestrial species","transmission of lyssaviruses","association of bats","novel related viruses","reports of zoonotic viruses","bat species harbor lyssaviruses","related lyssaviruses","zoonotic viral pathogens of significance","viral zoonoses","novel terrestrial hosts","main cause of rabies","animal health","onward transmission of viral pathogens","existing understating of virus classification","terrestrial carnivores","bat populations","potential routes of transmission","humans","characterisation of new lyssaviruses","carriers of zoonotic agents","deadly pathogens","details of potential future mechanisms","ability of existing vaccines","natural hosts","continued detection","current situation","risk","threat","reservoirs","update","bite of infected dogs","maintenance","spill","lyssavirus genus","fatal encephalitis","reasons","clinical signs","review"],"language":"en"},

Recent phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that this pathogenic fungus arrived in the PNW approximately 7 to 9 decades ago.

In 1964, a tsunami flooded local coastal regions, transporting C. gattii to land. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in animals and humans 3 decades later suggests that adaptation to local environs took time, possibly requiring an increase in virulence and further dispersal.

The empirical findings using the Korean airline panel data for the period 2006\u20132010 suggest that competition leads to less differentiated departure flight times as expected from spatial competition theory. Unlike the previous study on the U.S airline industry, the degree of this tendency for less differentiation differs across the type of routes: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type), in the deregulated period. Following the May 2008 Deregulation Act we find an increasingly clustered pattern of airline scheduling in the Jeju island routes where there have been competitive pressures associated with new low cost entrants. This recent evidence would imply that airline carriers strategically schedule departure flight times and allocate flights between routes as competition increases in the deregulated period.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Joo Yeon","journal":"Journal of Air Transport Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cc3be8a3752116b4c436728ec186107a783f4d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372850/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969699714001264; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699714001264; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2014.09.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type of routes","inland routes","Jeju island routes","airline carriers","deregulated period","S airline industry","Korean airline panel data","clustered pattern of airline scheduling","Korean domestic short-haul routes","leisure type","business type","impacts of competition level","spatial competition theory","differentiated departure flight times","competitive pressures","degree","new low cost entrants","flights","optimal air transport network strategy","empirical findings","system","hub","differentiation","previous study","tendency","paper","recent evidence","Deregulation"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that the tw forms of allelic frequencies detected Chinese individuals in our study were similar to the reported frequencies in other Asian populations but differed significantly from those in the African and Caucasian groups studied.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Ruijuan; Zhou, Yan; Qin, Lianhua; Jin, Ruiliang; Wang, Jie; Lu, Junmei; Wang, WeiBing; Tang, Shenjie; Hu, Zhongyi","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59061e34ef001be15318b4e286702b705b9b9547.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132724.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21081145/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2010.11.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885910005495; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885910005495","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["\u2212871A/G and \u2212336A/G"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mycobacterium tuberculosis","pulmonary tuberculosis patients","DC-SIGN gene","DC-SIGN promoter","susceptibility","promoter variants of DC","culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis case patients","reported frequencies","Chinese individuals","Caucasian groups","results","tw forms of allelic frequencies","eastern Chinese population","Asian populations","Abstract Dendritic cell","human dendritic cells","specific intracellular adhesion molecule","study","important receptor","protective effect","fever","nonintegrin","controls","total","polymorphisms","cavity formation","Previous studies","variation","allele","addition","analysis","pyrosequencing"],"language":"en"},

A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis\u2014for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziegler, Samantha J.; Liu, Chang; Landau, Mark; Buzovetsky, Olga; Desimmie, Belete A.; Zhao, Qi; Sasaki, Tomoaki; Burdick, Ryan C.; Pathak, Vinay K.; Anderson, Karen S.; Xiong, Yong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e0d5cb338ea8a2916c74b3b06789d3b21ac36a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5875850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29596531/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A3G deaminates","A3G-ssDNA interaction","preferred DNA substrate","nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G","A3G antiviral activity","novel DNA","viral ssDNA","mechanism of DNA substrate selection","A3 proteins act","loss of DNA affinity","specific DNA sequences","specific substrate sequence","single-stranded DNA","full-length protein","truncated protein","enzyme scans substrate","well-studied human A3 family members","protection of telomeres protein","dC","preferred substrates","enzyme-catalytic polypeptide","nucleotide-binding pockets","non-preferred adenine","viral infection","nanomolar affinity","catalytic site loops","family of cytidine deaminases","CCCA sequence motif","potent inhibitor of HIV","Human apolipoprotein B mRNA","innate immune response","evidence","light","example","catalysis","fusion strategy","unique conformation","poor solution behavior","Pot1","help","better understanding","conversion of deoxycytidine","virology studies","biochemistry","deoxyuridine","insights","structure","knowledge","results"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures. METHODS We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. RESULTS 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission. CONCLUSIONS Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Nisha S; Mytton, Oliver T; Mullins, Edward W S; Fowler, Tom A; Falconer, Catherine L; Murphy, Orla B; Langenberg, Claudia; Jayatunga, Wikum J P; Eddy, Danielle H; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392337/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","observed cases of COVID","infection rate","rate of cases","paediatric cases of COVID","young children","CONCLUSIONS Children","clinical outcomes","adults of infection","MERS-CoV","low observed case rate of COVID","little data","clinical presentation","attack rate","Limited data","Severe cases","reports of asymptomatic infection","transmission dynamics","narrative synthesis","narrative syntheses","paediatric populations","rapid systematic review","large epidemiological studies","milder course of disease","resource centres","literature","English abstracts of Chinese language papers","major journals","order","similar rates","public health measures","radiological abnormalities","publishers","METHODS","search terms","BACKGROUND","medical attention","databases","RESULTS","discrepancy","epidemiology","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

In fact, besides being involved in primary defense against infections\u2013mainly through phagocytosis, generation of toxic molecules, release of toxic enzymes and formation of extracellular traps\u2013neutrophils have been shown to play a role in finely regulating the development and the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. These latter neutrophil-mediated functions occur by a variety of mechanisms, including the production of newly manufactured cytokines. Herein, we provide a general overview of the chemotactic cytokines/chemokines that neutrophils can potentially produce, either under inflammatory/immune reactions or during their activation in more prolonged processes, such as in tumors. We highlight recent observations generated from studying human or rodent neutrophils in vitro and in vivo models. We also discuss the biological significance of neutrophil-derived chemokines in the context of infectious, neoplastic and immune-mediated diseases. The picture that is emerging is that, given their capacity to produce and release chemokines, neutrophils exert essential functions in recruiting, activating and modulating the activities of different leukocyte populations.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tecchio, Cristina; Cassatella, Marco A.","journal":"Seminars in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/113db0415367edaa4506fa09c05baf513fbbf9e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2016.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532316300173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532316300173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27151246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rodent neutrophils","polymorphonuclear neutrophils","release chemokines","neutrophil-mediated functions","derived chemokines","essential functions","immune reactions","immune responses","immune-mediated diseases","phagocytosis","release of toxic enzymes","chemotactic cytokines","evolution of inflammatory","manufactured cytokines","recent years","recent observations","generation of toxic molecules","biological significance of neutrophil","context of infectious","formation of extracellular traps","versatile cells","production","infections","activation","human","recruiting","general overview","variety of mechanisms","activities of different leukocyte populations","prolonged processes","primary defense","development","tumors","Abstract","models","capacity","role","picture"],"language":"en"},

The urgent need to decrease the use of antibiotics and increase animal welfare in beef production has forced us to introduce new preventive methods. Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs. Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3\u201314 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions. We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit. In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated). Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning. Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival. RESULTS: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves. Intranasal vaccination combined with older arrival age (17 days or older) resulted in a higher daily gain (47.8 g/day) compared with unvaccinated calves (coef. 0.0478, p = 0.003). This association was not recorded in calves that were younger than 17 days upon arrival. Intranasal vaccination was not significantly associated either with mortality (OR 0.976, p = 0.968) or treatment incidence for BRD (OR 1.341, p = 0.120). In total, six vaccinated calves (2.43%) and six unvaccinated calves (2.40%) died during the study period.

The peptides are potent, broad-spectrum microbicides that also modulate inflammatory responses in vitro and in animal models of viral infection and polymicrobial sepsis. \u03B8-Defensins suppress proinflammatory cytokine secretion by leukocytes stimulated with diverse Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Studies were performed to delineate anti-inflammatory mechanisms of rhesus \u03B8-defensin 1 (RTD-1), the most abundant \u03B8-defensin isoform in macaque granulocytes. RTD-1 reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, and IL-8 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human blood monocytes and THP-1 macrophages, and this was accompanied by inhibition of nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Peptide inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation occurred following stimulation of extracellular (TLRs 1/2 and 4) and intracellular (TLR9) receptors. Although RTD-1 did not inhibit MAPK in unstimulated cells, it induced phosphorylation of Akt in otherwise untreated monocytes and THP-1 cells. In the latter, this occurred within 10 min of RTD-1 treatment and produced a sustained elevation of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) for at least 4 h. pAkt is a negative regulator of MAPK and NF-\u03BAB activation. RTD-1 inhibited I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and stimulated Akt phosphorylation in LPS-treated human primary monocytes and THP-1 macrophages. Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) blocked RTD-1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and reversed the suppression of NF-\u03BAB activation by the peptide. These studies indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of \u03B8-defensins are mediated by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and suppression of proinflammatory signals in immune-stimulated cells.","publish_time":"2015-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tongaonkar, Prasad; Trinh, Katie K.; Schaal, Justin B.; Tran, Dat; Gulko, Percio S.; Ouellette, Andr\u00E9 J.; Selsted, Michael E.","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1af2140aa52b146b3f86ad71ef2652bb297f28e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4661038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26269197/; https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.3a0315-102r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661038/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK","PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB activation","stimulated Akt phosphorylation","\u03B8-Defensins","blocked RTD","induced phosphorylation of Akt","p38 MAPK phosphorylation","suppression of NF","Akt pathway","Peptide inhibition of NF","THP","immune-stimulated cells","stimulated human blood monocytes","inhibition of nuclear factor \u03BAB","anti-inflammatory properties of \u03B8","abundant \u03B8-defensin isoform","anti-inflammatory mechanisms of rhesus \u03B8-defensin","LPS","human primary monocytes","untreated monocytes","negative regulator of MAPK","sustained elevation of phosphorylated Akt","pAkt","unstimulated cells","PI3K","IL","macrophages","Studies","suppression of proinflammatory signals","proinflammatory cytokine secretion","Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol","secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","TNF-\u03B1","macrocyclic peptides","mitogen-activated protein kinase","leukocytes","animal models of viral infection","inhibited I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation","diverse Toll","following stimulation of extracellular","inflammatory responses","broad-spectrum microbicides","polymicrobial sepsis","macaque granulocytes","TLRs","interleukin","pathways","lipopolysaccharide","treatment","Old World monkeys","TLR9","receptors","ligands"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosticians often read Romanowsky\u2010stained cytology, although specific techniques such as immunocytochemistry are often essential for a definitive diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study aimed to investigate if immunocytochemistry on previously\u2010stained cytologic specimens was possible. Different pretreatments were examined to determine which treatment preserved antigenicity best. METHODS: One hundred and twenty\u2010two impression smears and 64 fine\u2010needle aspirate preparations of brain and lymph nodes were processed and evaluated microscopically. The impact of staining cytologic preparations with a modified Wright\u0027s stain, using a destaining method, performing a coverslipping and decoverslipping process, and subjecting smears to a microwave treatment (MWT) were examined for the immunolabeling of selected nuclear, cytoplasmic, and plasmalemmal antigens, as well as intracellular feline coronavirus (FCoV). Biotinylated secondary antibodies were used, and the bound primary antibody was visualized using an ABC amplification kit. RESULTS: Cellular antigens were reliably detected with immunocytochemistry after smears were stained with a Romansky stain and were coverslipped early after staining and stayed coverslipped until immediately before immunolabeling. The staining intensity reached the same levels as that of the controls if the films underwent MWT in citrate buffer. In contrast, FCoV antigen detection was abolished after any physicochemical interference. CONCLUSIONS: Poststaining immunocytochemistry represents a practical tool for additional investigations on prestained cytologic specimens when searching for cellular antigens. Paired untreated samples should be kept in case the workup requires testing for more vulnerable viral antigens.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00F6rfelt, Stefanie; Matiasek, Lara A.; Felten, Sandra; Sangl, Laura; Hartmann, Katrin; Matiasek, Kaspar","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ab7c15271a9a80bd7ac4617b211afbf832e6a1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169317.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802342/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wright","Romansky"],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Poststaining immunocytochemistry","Cellular antigens","plasmalemmal antigens","stained cytology","impact of staining cytologic preparations","prestained cytologic specimens","subjecting smears","impression smears","MWT","vulnerable viral antigens","staining intensity","sample preservation","clinical cytology","microwave treatment","Romansky stain","modified Wright\u0027s stain","low sample volume","FCoV antigen detection","immunolabeling of selected nuclear","needle aspirate preparations of brain","poor cell representation","practical tool","additional investigations","destaining method","testing","specific techniques","lymph nodes","decoverslipping process","case","workup","films","applicability","intracellular feline coronavirus","Romanowsky","present study","ancillary test","bound primary antibody","ABC amplification kit","goal","citrate buffer","controls","contrast","levels","CONCLUSIONS","Diagnosticians","Paired untreated samples","physicochemical interference","definitive diagnosis","Biotinylated secondary antibodies","OBJECTIVES","antigenicity best","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Different pretreatments","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, there is a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH for governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders. This paper outlines a conceptual framework of what OH approaches can encompass and the added values they can provide. The framework was developed during a workshop conducted by the \u201CNetwork for Evaluation of One Health,\u201D an Action funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology. By systematically describing the various aspects of OH, we provide the basis for measuring and monitoring the integration of disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders in health initiatives.

Because of the paucity of available data and the cost associated with experimental approaches, any construction and analysis of such a network in the near future has to rely on computational predictions.

Second, the prospective host binding partners have to be determined and finally, the impact on the host cell analyzed.

Although unique structural features of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) provide a physical and physiological barrier, a number of neurotropic viruses are able to enter the CNS resulting in a variety of pathological outcomes. Nonetheless, antigen-specific lymphocytes are ultimately able to accumulate within the CNS and contribute to defense by reducing or eliminating the invading viral pathogen. Alternatively, infiltration of activated cells of the immune system may be detrimental, as these cells can contribute to neuropathology that may result in long-term cellular damage or death. More recently, myeloid cells e.g. neutrophils have been implicated in contributing to both host defense and disease in response to viral infection of the CNS.

Clinical data were collected, and multiplex RT-PCR analyses were done for various microorganisms. Hyponatremia was observed in 531 (13.5%) patients. The incidence of hyponatremia differed according to the respiratory tract infection (P \u003C 0.0001) and microorganism (P = 0.001). In children with hyponatremia, the age at admission was significantly older (P \u003C 0.0001), male gender was more frequent (P = 0.019), CRP was higher (P \u003C 0.0001), and coinfection with multiple organisms was more common (P = 0.001) than in children without hyponatremia.

Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, infections associated with this treatment modality have not been well documented. METHODS: We analyzed infectious complications that followed CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 53 adult patients with relapsed B-ALL enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT01044069). RESULTS: Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced 26 infections (17 bacterial, 4 fungal, and 5 viral) within the first 30 days of CAR T-cell infusion. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients in whom complete remission was achieved, 15 infections developed between days 31 and 180; the majority of these late infections were due to respiratory viruses. In general, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were detected at a median of 18, 23, and 48 days, respectively, after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS grade 3 or higher was independently associated with increased risk of subsequent infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; P = .05) and in particular with bloodstream infection (adjusted HR, 19.97; P \u003C .001). Three of 53 patients (6%) died of an infection-related cause. CONCLUSIONS: Infections in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL are common after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Understanding the infectious complications that are temporally coincident with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is critical for developing effective prophylactic and other supportive care measures to improve clinical outcomes.

The potential usefulness of neopterin in early prognostic information of dengue virus infection was investigated. Methods Neopterin concentrations were determined in serum samples from 110 dengue fever (DF) patients. The neopterin levels were compared with those in 50 measles and 40 influenza patients; 155 healthy blood donors served as controls. Results In acute sera of DF patients mean neopterin concentration was 48.2nmol/L, which was higher than that in patients with measles (mean: 36.3nmol/L) and influenza (18.8nmol/L) and in healthy controls (6.7nmol/L; P \u003C0.001). In the patients with confirmed DF, an early neopterin elevation was detected already at the first day after the onset of symptoms and rose to a maximum level of 54.3nmol/L 4days after the onset.

Two years before, she had developed early onset of urinary symptoms. Methods and results Neuroimaging showed atrophy of the spine and medulla as well as a leukodystrophy affecting both supra- and infra-tentorial regions. At autopsy, polyglucosan bodies (PB) were seen in several peripheral tissues, including the diaphragm, and nervous tissues such as peripheral nerves, cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, hippocampus, brainstem and cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the brain revealed an exclusive astrocytic localization of the PB. The diagnosis of adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) was confirmed by enzymatic and molecular studies. Conclusion Storage of abnormal glycogen in astrocytes is sufficient to cause the leukodystrophy of APBD. Since brain glycogen is almost exclusively metabolized in astrocytes, this observation sheds light on the pathophysiology of APBD. In addition, this is the first report of an APBD patient presenting with a subacute diaphragmatic failure.","publish_time":"2013-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dainese, Linda; Monin, Marie-Lorraine; Demeret, Sophie; Brochier, Guy; Froissart, Roseline; Spraul, Anne; Schiffmann, Raphael; Seilhean, Danielle; Mochel, Fanny","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89da9778869d4f91772221b9d9c7bfdc04a58766.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126849.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266647/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111912015958; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111912015958; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leukodystrophy of APBD","APBD patient","pathophysiology of APBD","astrocytes","peripheral tissues","brain glycogen","subacute diaphragmatic failure","peripheral nerves","Abstract Background","nervous tissues","polyglucosan bodies","fatal respiratory failure","severe diaphragmatic dysfunction","Conclusion Storage of abnormal glycogen","year old woman of Cambodian ethnic background","diagnosis of adult polyglucosan body disease","basal ganglia","cerebral white matter","hippocampus","atrophy","observation sheds light","exclusive astrocytic localization","results Neuroimaging","spine","brainstem","infra-tentorial regions","electron microscopy","early onset of urinary symptoms","Methods","cerebellum","Immunohistochemistry","medulla","report","autopsy","molecular studies","addition","years"],"language":"en"},

One plausible explanation for this could be that this particular subtype is better adapted to colonise cattle, and thereby may be excreted in greater concentrations and for longer periods than other VTEC O157:H7 subtypes. METHODS: In an experimental study, 4 calves were inoculated with 10(9 )colony forming units (cfu) of strain CCUG 53931, representative of the subtype VTEC O157:H7 (PT4;vtx(2);vtx(2c)). Two un-inoculated calves were co-housed with the inoculated calves. Initially, the VTEC O157:H7 strain had been isolated from a dairy herd with naturally occurring infection and the farm had previously also been linked to human infection with the same strain. Faecal samples were collected over up to a 2-month period and analysed for VTEC O157 by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS), and IMS positive samples were further analysed by direct plating to elucidate the shedding pattern. Samples were also collected from the pharynx. RESULTS: All inoculated calves proved culture-positive in faeces within 24 hours after inoculation and the un-inoculated calves similarly on days 1 and 3 post-inoculation. One calf was persistently culture-positive for 43 days; in the remainder, the VTEC O157:H7 count in faeces decreased over the first 2 weeks. All pharyngeal samples were culture-negative for VTEC O157:H7. CONCLUSION: This study contributes with information concerning the dynamics of a specific subtype of VTEC O157:H7 colonisation in dairy calves. This subtype, VTEC O157:H7 (PT4;vtx(2;)vtx(2c)), is frequently isolated from Swedish cattle and has also been found to cause the majority of reported human infections in Sweden during the past 15 years. In most calves, inoculated with a representative strain of this specific subtype, the numbers of shed bacteria declined over the first two weeks. One calf could possibly be classified as a high-shedder, excreting high levels of the bacterium for a prolonged period.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonsson, Malin E; Eriksson, Erik; Boqvist, Sofia; Urdahl, Anne Margrete; Asp\u00E1n, Anna","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6507acff69dc9963ee7fdffc4a7f4edae0b5f609.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2776595.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-51-43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["VTEC","IMS"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["subtype VTEC O157","specific subtype of VTEC O157","H7 strain","un-inoculated calves","vtx","H7 colonisation","H7 count","H7 subtypes","dairy calves","particular subtype of verocytotoxin","culture-positive","IMS positive samples","representative strain","strain CCUG","human infections","pharyngeal samples","Faecal samples","faeces","culture-negative","PT4","Sweden","days","years","majority","weeks","calf","high levels","high-shedder","dairy herd","experimental study","post-inoculation","prolonged period","month period","Swedish cattle","Escherichia coli","longer periods","immuno-magnetic separation","hours","dynamics","direct plating","units","cfu","bacterium","information","numbers of shed bacteria","remainder","sporadic cases","shedding pattern","greater concentrations","RESULTS","outbreaks","colony","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","phage type","plausible explanation","farm","pharynx","genes"],"language":"en"},

For hydrophilic viruses, the collection efficiencies of the Andersen impactor, impinger, and gelatin filter were 10 times higher than that of the nuclepore filter. For hydrophilic viruses, the collection efficiencies of all four samplers were 10\u2013100 times higher than hydrophobic viruses. The infectivity of the virus in collected samples was also evaluated for an AGI-30 impinger. Results showed that the viruses retained more infectivity when the samples were refrigerated (up to 1 day) during storage than when stored at room temperature (up to 8h). Therefore, even when refrigerated, airborne virus samples collected using an impinger should be processed as soon as possible to avoid loss of virus infectivity.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Chun-Chieh; Li, Chih-Shan","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08364442973b11c221fa28d6a1164b511219de49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118727.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850204004161; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2004.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287372/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850204004161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impinger","hydrophilic viruses","gelatin filter","nuclepore filter","hydrophobic viruses","mammalian viruses","airborne virus samples","virus particles","loss of virus infectivity","Abstract Collection efficiencies","collection efficiency","Andersen impactor","AGI","times higher","Results","bioaerosol samplers","surrogates","storage","room temperature","morphology","different bacteriophages","day","aerosols"],"language":"en"},

Information on the incidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) infections in developing countries, especially among rural children, is very limited. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify whether these viruses were associated with ARTI among children \u22645 years of age in rural and peri-urban populations in South India. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional with prospective sample collection. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children \u22645 years of age presenting with ARTI. None of the children in this study were known to have any immunosuppressive conditions. The two viruses, hMPV and HBoV, were identified using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and one-step PCR assays, respectively. The lower limits of detection of hMPV and HBoV were 6.69 \u00D7 10(5) plasmid copies and 5.77 \u00D7 10(3) plasmid copies, respectively, per 5 \u03BCL PCR reaction input. RESULTS: The frequency of hMPV infection in children was higher than that of HBoV infection. The different frequencies of hMPV in patients in various age groups with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were compared, and the variance was found to be insignificant. In the 38 children who were hMPV positive, the majority (73.7 %) were from rural communities. The overall hMPV-positive rate was higher in the rural population than in the peri-urban population, but the difference was statistically insignificant. The youngest age at which hMPV-positive status was recorded was 5 months. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that hMPV was associated with a significant number (i.e. \u003E10 %) of ARTIs in children in South India, whereas a relatively smaller number of HBoV infections was observed.","publish_time":"2013-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narayanan, Harikrishnan; Sankar, Sathish; Simoes, Eric A.

In a KRS, semantic structures or statements about the world of interest to medicine are analogous to natural language sentences seen as formed from noun phrases separated by verbs, prepositions and other descriptions of relationships. A convenient method of testing and better curating these elements of knowledge is by having the computer use them to take the test of a multiple choice medical licensing examination. It is a venture which perhaps tells us almost as much about the reasoning of students and examiners as it does about the requirements for Artificial Intelligence as employed in clinical decision making. It emphasizes the role of context and of contextual probabilities as opposed to the more familiar intrinsic probabilities, and of a preliminary form of logic that we call presyllogistic reasoning.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robson, Barry; Boray, Srinidhi","journal":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30d78fc235a5078626512cc95533e759885da094.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094475.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27089305/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.02.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482516300397; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482516300397","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elements of knowledge","Abstract Extracting medical knowledge","medical records","natural language sentences","inference language","Knowledge Representation Store","KRS","unstructured data mining of natural language source text","clinical decision support","clinical decision making","Dirac notation","contextual probabilities","presyllogistic reasoning","reasoning of students","multiple choice medical licensing examination","large numbers of elements","familiar intrinsic probabilities","Q-UEL Web","Internet","universal exchange","prepositions","world","algebraic principles","quantum mechanics","medicine","noun phrases","linguistic theory","Artificial Intelligence","verbs","preliminary form of logic","semantic structures","statements","extent","sources","requirements","examiners","role of context","descriptions of relationships","convenient method of testing","computer","Output","venture"],"language":"en"},

However, the mean screening performance obtained when candidate ligands are docked with Vina and rescored with NNScore 1.0 is not statistically different than the mean performance obtained when docking and scoring with Glide. We further demonstrate that the Vina and NNScore docking scores both correlate with chemical properties like small-molecule size and polarizability. Compensating for these potential biases leads to improvements in virtual screen performance. Composite NNScore-based scoring functions suited to a specific receptor further improve performance.

An absolutely airtight space effectively prevents infectious diseases from leaking out of the isolation room. Opening the door leads to a breakdown in isolation conditions and causes the dispersion of infectious air out of the isolation room. Extensively employed to manage smoke in cases of fires at subway and highway tunnels, a concept of controlling airflow is applied to the study. This study proposes a design of ventilation system to control air flow rate for containing airborne contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent rooms when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. This paper employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a more effective approach to examine the concentration maps of airborne contaminants and the airflow patterns of room air and discuss the influence of temperature differences between two rooms on airborne dispersion. Results show that an air velocity above 0.2 m/s via a doorway effectively prevents the spread of airborne contaminants out of the isolation room in the state of door opening.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tung, Yun-Chun; Shih, Yang-Cheng; Hu, Shih-Cheng","journal":"Applied Thermal Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55fbba8d0018233e32cfd446ca54bca998bac636.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108432.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2008.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288590/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431108003050; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359431108003050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation conditions","negative pressure isolation room","airflow patterns of room air","airborne dispersion","dispersion of infectious air","spread of airborne contaminants","air velocity","infectious diseases","air flow rate","concentration maps of airborne contaminants","state of door","study","adjacent rooms","concept of controlling airflow","CFD","subway","highway tunnels","design of ventilation system","influence of temperature differences","cases of fires","paper","computational fluid dynamics","effective approach","cure patients","smoke","airtight space","doorway","breakdown","Results"],"language":"en"},

Recently, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia reported a substantial increase in MERS cases, primarily from the Riyadh region. The objective of the present study was to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices towards MERS among physicians, nurses, pharmacist and technicians individually. METHODS: A cross sectional study conducted at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia among individual healthcare workers. The survey questionnaire was self-administrated and consisted of five sections: Demographic; Source of MERS information; Knowledge; Attitude; and Practice of healthcare workers towards MERS. RESULTS: A total of 391 participants of which physicians (162; 41.4%), pharmacists (18; 4.6%), nurses (130; 33.3%) and technicians (81; 20.7%) were included with a response rate of 95.71%. The majority of the participants were female (53.70%) and mostly in the nurse\u2019s category (40.5%). The participants reported the highest main source of information was seminars and workshops (n = 191; 48%) followed by social media (n = 179; 45%). The overall score indicates good knowledge among physicians (95.7%), pharmacists (88.9%), nurses (86.2%) and technicians (91.4%) and showed statistically significant (p = 0.039). The study showed a positive attitude among physicians (96.3%), pharmacist (94.4%), nurses (94.6%) and technicians (90.1%) with no statistically significant (p = 0.273). However, the majority of the participants showed average practices towards MERS. However, the least practice among participants was the use of facemask in the crowds (24.2%). The demographic characteristic\u2019s age, gender and professions showed significantly associated with mean knowledge score. Similarly, statistical significance observed in gender and experience demographic variables with a mean attitude score. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that different health workers showed good knowledge and positive attitudes, but low to average practices towards MERS with low adherence to facemask practice. When comparing workers, physicians have a high degree of knowledge and attitude when compared to nurses, pharmacist and technicians.","publish_time":"2019-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albarrak, Ahmed I.; Mohammed, Rafiuddin; Al Elayan, Ali; Al Fawaz, Feras; Al Masry, Musab; Al Shammari, Mohammed; Miaygil, Saud Bin","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4ab9531c3e533430fd042407b9493c46ebf09fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102554.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431424/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119302394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119302394; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.06.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Ministry of Health","King Khalid University Hospital"],"locations":["Middle East","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["physicians","participants","nurses","technicians","MERS cases","good knowledge","Source of MERS information","mean knowledge score","mean attitude score","Practice of healthcare workers","high degree of knowledge","average practices","present study","facemask practice","different health workers","individual healthcare workers","Saudi Arabia","cross sectional study","gender","overall score","majority","pharmacists","experience demographic variables","demographic characteristic\u2019s age","low adherence","positive attitudes","highest main source of information","Riyadh region","Ministry of Health","use of facemask","viral respiratory illness","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","King Khalid University Hospital","seminars","professions","substantial increase","sections","BACKGROUND","workshops","statistical significance","survey questionnaire","METHODS","total","social media","crowds","objective","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","female","response rate","nurse\u2019s category","humans"],"language":"en"},

The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of S\u00E3o Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001\u20132010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002\u20132004 and 2008\u20132009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12% of the total, and 27% of high at-risk patients.

The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet\u2019s microbiome. Contigs matched Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10(6.42)\u201310(7.01) copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.","publish_time":"2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theuns, Sebastiaan; Vanmechelen, Bert; Bernaert, Quinten; Deboutte, Ward; Vandenhole, Marilou; Beller, Leen; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Maes, Piet; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eff8bed68ef6109e8f0c51a8b1ec4b6ca5b6329e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6026206.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-28180-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Contigs"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Belgium"],"keyphrases":["viral diagnostics","diarrheic feces","true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus","Belgian diarrheic piglets","diarrheic signs","Enteric diseases","MinION","Reads","capacities of nanopore sequencing","high sequencing depths","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","week of age","rapid detection of enteric viruses","Suckling piglets","peak of viral shedding","week-old piglet","Escherichia","metagenomics","association","related kobuviruses","Contigs matched Bacteroides","Enterococcus phages","cell culture","swine","rotavirus","different pathogens","useful tool","Retrospective analysis","copies","swab","time","Belgium","new methodologies","extensive validations","seconds","follow-up study","piglet\u2019s microbiome","subclinical importance","bacteriophages"],"language":"en"},

Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF\u2013THEN semantic fuzzy rules.

Primary outcome was chest tube drainage; secondary outcomes included transfusion needs, inotrope score, ventilation time, and hospital length of stay. Results Patients who received reconstituted fresh whole blood had significantly less postoperative chest tube volume loss per kilogram of body weight (7.7 mL/kg vs 11.8 mL/kg; P = .03).

Travelers belonged to those primarily affected in the early stages of the outbreak, travelers became vectors of the disease, and finally, travel and tourism themselves became the victims. The outbreak of SARS created international anxiety because of its novelty, its ease of transmission in certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel, combined with extensive media coverage. The psychological impacts of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, have diminished international travel in 2003, far beyond the limitations to truly SARS hit areas. Governments and press, especially in non SARS affected areas, have been slow to strike the right balance between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context. Screening at airport entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself. The low yield in detecting SARS is most likely due to a combination of factors, such as travel advisories which resulted in reduced travel to and from SARS affected areas, implementation of effective pre-departure screening at airports in SARS-hit countries, and a rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was finally introduced. Rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system. If SARS reoccurs, the subsequent outbreak will be smaller and more easily contained if the lessons learnt from the recent epidemic are applied. Lessons learnt during the outbreak in relation to international travel will be discussed.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilder-Smith, Annelies","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a503b9616f3c0a70de136a65b2e35d276f511a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106206.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893905000529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893905000529","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Travelers"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak of SARS","international travel","Summary SARS","jet travel","travel restrictions","reduced travel","psychological impacts of SARS","areas","airport screening measures","international authorities","international anxiety","subsequent outbreak","points of entry","airport entry points","low yield","Travelers","lessons","implementation of effective pre-departure screening","frequent risk communication","airports","rare infectious diseases","right balance","new cases","speed","infection control capacities","novelty","ease of transmission","rapid decline","certain settings","time","investments","countries","relation","extensive media coverage","healthcare system","advisories","spread","early stages","vectors","combination of factors","proper context","recent epidemic","tourism","victims","press","limitations","Governments"],"language":"en"},

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but no data concerning kidney transplant (KTx) recipients infected with COVID-19 are available. To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset. Four patients received a reduced dose of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy during hospitalization. As of March 4, 2020 NAT was negative for COVID-19 in three patients twice in succession, and their computed tomography scans showed improved images.

Although the influenza vaccine is able to achieve serological responses in some allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients, its clinical benefits are still uncertain. METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination on the prevalence of influenza RVI in a consecutive cohort of 136 allo-HSCT adult recipients who developed 161 RVI over 5 flu seasons (from 2013 to 2018). Respiratory viruses in upper\u2013 and/or lower\u2013respiratory tract specimens were tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel assays. RESULTS: Overall, we diagnosed 74 episodes (46%) of influenza RVI in 70 allo-HSCT recipients. Influenza RVI occurred in 51% of the non-vaccinated compared to 36% of the vaccinated recipients (P = .036). A multivariate analysis showed that influenza vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of influenza RVI (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, P = .01). A multivariate risk factor analysis of lower\u2013respiratory tract disease (LRTD) identified 2 conditions associated with the probability of influenza RVI progression: influenza vaccination (OR 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014\u20131, P = .05) and a high-risk immunodeficiency score (OR 36, 95% CI 2.26\u2013575, P = .011). Influenza vaccination was also associated with a lower likelihood of an influenza-related hospital admission (14% vs 2%, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that influenza vaccination may have a clinical benefit in allo-HSCT recipients with virologically-confirmed RVI, in terms of a lower influenza RVI prevalence, slower LRTD progression, and lower likelihood of hospital admission.","publish_time":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1ana, Jos\u00E9 Luis; P\u00E9rez, Ariadna; Montoro, Juan; Gim\u00E9nez, Estela; G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Lorenzo, Ignacio; Madrid, Silvia; Gonz\u00E1lez, Eva Mar\u00EDa; Vinuesa, V\u00EDctor; Hern\u00E1ndez-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Salavert, Miguel; Sanz, Guillermo; Solano, Carlos; Sanz, Jaime; Navarro, David","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74f4764e69df8d0fa3ca4d83143e9e13000aee96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108095.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower prevalence of influenza RVI","lower influenza RVI prevalence","influenza vaccine","probability of influenza RVI progression","influenza respiratory virus infection","influenza-related hospital admission","effect of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination","allo-HSCT recipients","allo-HSCT adult recipients","vaccinated recipients","lower likelihood of hospital admission","Respiratory viruses","multivariate risk factor analysis of lower","respiratory tract specimens","respiratory tract disease","multivariate analysis","slower LRTD progression","clinical benefits","cross-sectional study","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","serological responses","primary method","multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel assays","consecutive cohort","odds ratio","terms","vs","conditions","confidence interval","high-risk immunodeficiency score","BACKGROUND","METHODS","flu seasons","CONCLUSIONS","episodes","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy\u2014one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 \u201CSpanish influenza\u201D pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400\u2013470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen\u0027s Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder.

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients. The average age is 49\u00B115 years and there were slightly more male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127 (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively, with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value\u003C0.001).

Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. METHODS: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in-depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. FINDINGS: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi-public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Currently, harm reduction equipment and resources for safe injecting are not meeting the needs of people who inject drugs who are street homeless or unstably housed. Preparation of injections with non-sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, Magdalena; Scott, Jenny; Hope, Vivian; Wright, Talen; McGowan, Catherine; Ciccarone, Daniel","journal":"Harm Reduct J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62503f1644ab37642dbc887d28642c76c288bf09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7145770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276626/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00369-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["London"],"keyphrases":["puddle water","clean water","cold water","toilet cistern water","non-sterile water sources","injection preparation","injection practices","injecting drugs","ability of people","needs of people","serious bacterial infections","public health crisis","everyday realities of people","public toilet closures","Preparation of injections","safe injecting","health conditions","fungal infections","heroin mixture","Care","crack cocaine","health harms","Participants","Access","drug-related deaths","harm reduction equipment","growing homeless population","harm reduction messaging","drug use","lifetime history of street homelessness","life history","Qualitative accounts","semi-public spaces","related hospitalisation","in-depth qualitative interview","whisky","survey sample","challenging environment","cola soda","increase","environments","resources","stage addition of solvent","high proportion","underexplored environmental constraint","skin cleaning","London","data","Alternatives","new finding","United Kingdom","essential services","Austerity measures","vulnerable citizens","Multiple constraints","additional risk of infection","saliva","CONCLUSION","UK","stages","financial barriers","BACKGROUND","Cuts","FINDINGS","paper","METHODS","questionnaire","study","streets","vehicle","application of heat"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, ISG15 exerts functions in its free form both, as an intracellular and as a secreted protein. In agreement with its role as a type I IFN effector, most functions of ISG15 and ISGylation are linked to the anti-pathogenic response. However, also key roles in other cellular processes such as protein translation, cytoskeleton dynamics, exosome secretion, autophagy or genome stability and cancer were described. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) constitutes the major ISG15 specific protease which counteracts ISG15 conjugation. Remarkably, USP18 also functions as a critical negative regulator of the IFN response irrespective of its enzymatic activity. Concordantly, lack of USP18 function causes fatal interferonopathies in humans and mice. The negative regulatory function of USP18 in IFN signaling is regulated by various protein\u2013protein interactions and its stability is controlled via proteasomal degradation. The broad repertoire of physiological functions and regulation of ISG15 and USP18 offers a variety of potential intervention strategies which might be of therapeutic use. Due to the high mutation rates of pathogens which are often species specific and constantly give rise to a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, immune effector systems are under constant evolutionarily pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable differences in ISG15 with respect to function and sequence exist even among closely related species. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the translational potential of results obtained in model organisms especially for therapeutic strategies. This review covers existing and conceptual assay systems to target and identify modulators of ISG15, ISGylation, USP18 function, and protein\u2013protein interactions within this context. Strategies comprise mouse models for translational perspectives, cell-based and biochemical assays as well as chemical probes.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jim\u00E9nez Fern\u00E1ndez, Daniel; Hess, Sandra; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter","journal":"Front Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0ece8ef777c5e15e41c4140cb6be2a8944af191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6985271.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32039148/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2019.00923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functions of ISG15","regulation of ISG15","modulators of ISG15","ISG15 conjugation","protein interactions","protein translation","various protein","secreted protein","lack of USP18 function","major ISG15 specific protease","negative regulatory function of USP18","IFN effector","IFN response","ISGylation","therapeutic strategies","species specific","Ubiquitin-specific protease","immune effector systems","variety of potential intervention strategies","broad repertoire of physiological functions","translational potential of results","variety of immune evasion mechanisms","translational perspectives","genome stability","related species","therapeutic use","target substrates","conceptual assay systems","critical negative regulator","anti-pathogenic response","exosome secretion","autophagy","cytoskeleton dynamics","fatal interferonopathies","cellular processes","model organisms","cascade of E1","mouse models","humans","respect","rise","type","sequence","biochemical assays","stimulated gene product","considerable differences","E2","review","free form","high mutation rates of pathogens","chemical probes","E3 enzymes","key roles","mice","cancer","pressure","enzymatic activity","Ubl","context","agreement","proteasomal degradation"],"language":"en"},

Although the widespread occurrence of divergent human SaV strains has been reported, there have only been a few studies of porcine SaVs examining their genetic diversity. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of porcine SaVs in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. Two hundred and thirty-seven fecal specimens from piglets with diarrhea were examined from 78 farms over a 2-year period from six provinces in South Korea. Overall, 69 (29.1%) of the samples from five provinces tested positive for porcine SaVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR with the primer pairs specific to porcine SaVs. An analysis of the partial capsid gene (757bp) of 12 porcine SaVs detected from fecal samples showed genetic divergence, not only among the Korean porcine SaVs (67.7\u201399.1%), but also between Korean and American porcine SaVs (69.1\u201390.2%). Interestingly, one strain (Po/SaV/JN-MA113/05/Korea), formed a second porcine SaV/GIII genotype, and is tentatively called GIII/2. This strain had a 0.236\u20130.405 inter-cluster distance with the other strains in the same genogroup, which is comparable to the distances between the established GI and GII SaVs. Furthermore, two potential recombinant porcine SaVs were identified. In conclusion, porcine SaV infections are common in diarrheic piglets in South Korea. The infecting strains are genetically diverse, and include a newly recognized genotype and recombinant viruses within genogroup III.","publish_time":"2007-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeong, Cheol; Park, Sang-Ik; Park, Sung-Hee; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Park, Su-Jin; Jeong, Jae-Ho; Choy, Hyon E.; Saif, Linda J.; Kim, Sang-Ki; Kang, Mun-Il; Hyun, Bang-Hun; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e8ed29acb3519e7f95928e88892626bd4d9cd72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117395.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507000673; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507000673","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Po/SaV/JN","GIII","III"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["Korean porcine SaVs","American porcine SaVs","studies of porcine SaVs","genetic diversity of porcine SaVs","potential recombinant porcine SaVs","GII SaVs","porcine SaV infections","South Korea","diarrheic piglets","diarrhea","genetic divergence","provinces","fecal samples","infecting strains","genogroup","GIII genotype","widespread occurrence of divergent human SaV strains","nested PCR","RT-PCR","recognized genotype","recombinant viruses","fecal specimens","primer pairs specific","important cause of gastroenteritis","Caliciviridae family","bp","established GI","year period","JN-MA113","humans","partial capsid gene","distances","conclusion","inter-cluster distance","analysis","farms","study","Abstract Sapoviruses","animals","aim"],"language":"en"},

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea, with 100% mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks old. No investigation has yet been made of the small intestine of piglets that survived infection by TGEV. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on the small intestine of recovered pigs. RESULTS: Histological analyses showed that TGEV infection led to villi atrophy, and reduced villous height and crypt depth. The number of SIgA positive cells, CD3(\u002B)T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in jejunum decreased after TGEV infection in vivo. In contrast, microfold cell (M cell) numbers and cell proliferation increased in infected pigs. TGEV infection also significantly enhanced the mRNA expression levels of cytokine IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, IL-10, and TGF-\u03B2. Additionally, lower gene copy numbers of Lactobacillus, and higher numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, were detected in mucosal scraping samples from TGEV-infected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: TGEV infection damages the small intestine, impairs immune functions, and increases pathogenic bacterial loading, all of which may facilitate secondary infections by other pathogens. These findings help quantify the impact of TGEV infection and clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying its effects in pigs.","publish_time":"2018-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Lu; Yang, Yunhan; Wang, Jialu; Jing, Yuchao; Yang, Qian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7430273f21b3a172f7f6e796636e376c2053fd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6006930.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1012-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of TGEV infection","TGEV-infected pigs","small intestine of recovered pigs","small intestine of piglets","dendritic cells","T cells","Pig diarrhea","cell proliferation","microfold cell","higher numbers of Enterobacteriaceae","high mortality","number of SIgA positive cells","pathogenic mechanisms","TGF-\u03B2","lower gene copy numbers of Lactobacillus","mRNA expression levels of cytokine IL","pathogenic bacterial loading","large economic losses","CD3","immune functions","mucosal scraping samples","villous height","villi atrophy","DCs","jejunum","swine industry","BACKGROUND","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Histological analyses","TNF-\u03B1","crypt depth","RESULTS","effects","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","weeks old","secondary infections","pathogens","study","findings","METHODS","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Because of its heat sensitivity, we hypothesized that a steam conditioner and pellet mill mimicking traditional commercial thermal processing may mitigate PEDV infectivity. Pelleting, a common feed processing method, includes the use of steam and shear forces, resulting in increased temperature of the processed feed. Two thermal processing experiments were designed to determine if different pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures would impact PEDV quantity and infectivity by analysis of quantitative reverse transcription PCR and bioassay. In Exp. 1, a 3 \u00B7 3 \u00B7 2 factorial design was used with 3 pelleting temperatures (68.3, 79.4, and 90.6\u00B0C), 3 conditioning times (45, 90, or 180 s), and 2 doses of viral inoculation (low, 1 \u00B7 10(2) tissue culture infectious dose(50) (the concentration used to see cytopathic effect in 50% of the cells)/g, or high, 1 \u00B7 10(4) tissue culture infectious dose(50)/g). Noninoculated and PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash were used as controls. The low-dose PEDV\u2013infected mash had 6.8 \u00B1 1.8 cycle threshold (Ct) greater (P \u003C 0.05) PEDV than the high-dose mash. Regardless of time or temperature, pelleting reduced (P \u003C 0.05) the quantity of detectable viral PEDV RNA compared with the PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash. Fecal swabs from pigs inoculated with the PEDV-positive unprocessed mash, regardless of dose, were clinically PEDV positive from 2 to 7 d (end of the trial) after inoculation. However, if either PEDV dose of inoculated feed was pelleted at any of the 9 tested conditioning time \u00B7 temperature combinations, no PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs or cecum content. Based on Exp. 1 results, a second experiment was developed to determine the impact of lower processing temperatures on PEDV quantity and infectivity. In Exp. 2, PEDV-inoculated feed was pelleted at 1 of 5 conditioning temperatures (37.8, 46.1, 54.4, 62.8, and 71.1\u00B0C) for 30 s. The 5 increasing processing temperatures led to feed with respective mean Ct values of 32.5, 34.6, 37.0, 36.5, and 36.7, respectively. All samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, infectivity was detected by bioassay only in pigs from the 37.8 and 46.1\u00B0C conditioning temperatures. Experiment 2 results suggest conditioning and pelleting temperatures above 54.4\u00B0C could be effective in reducing the quantity and infectivity of PEDV in swine feed. However, additional research is needed to prevent subsequent recontamination after pelleting as it is a point-in-time mitigation step.","publish_time":"2017-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cochrane, R.

Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV\u2010permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time\u2010of\u2010addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.

Consequently, it has received much attention from academics and the retail industry. The aim of this study is to review, identify, and synthesise the psychological causes of panic buying, which is a relatively new and unexplored area in consumer behaviour research. A systematic review of the related literature is conducted. The review suggests that panic buying is influenced by (1) individuals\u0027 perception of the threat of the health crisis and scarcity of products; (2) fear of the unknown, which is caused by negative emotions and uncertainty; (3) coping behaviour, which views panic buying as a venue to relieve anxiety and regain control over the crisis; and (4) social psychological factors, which account for the influence of the social network of an individual. This study contributes to the literature by consolidating the scarce and scattered research on the causes of panic buying, drawing greater theoretical insights into each cause and also offers some implications for health professionals, policy makers, and retailers on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to manage panic buying. Recommendations for future research are also provided.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuen, Kum Fai; Wang, Xueqin; Ma, Fei; Li, Kevin X","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443427/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103513","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["panic buying","psychological causes of panic","health crisis","scattered research","consumer behaviour research","future research","systematic review","study","social psychological factors","health professionals","social network","related literature","retailers","policy makers","implications","threat","unexplored area","account","appropriate policies","greater theoretical insights","stockouts","countries","influence","scarcity of products","strategies","supply chain disruptions","academics","retail industry","attention","uncertainty","control","anxiety","pandemic","frequent occurrence","venue","negative emotions","individuals\u0027 perception","recent COVID","fear","Recommendations","aim"],"language":"en"},

Here, we weigh the economic costs and benefits associated with implementing widespread quarantine in Toronto during the SARS outbreaks of 2003. Methods We compared the costs of two outbreak scenarios: in Scenario A, SARS is able to transmit itself throughout a population without any significant public health interventions. In Scenario B, quarantine is implemented early on in an attempt to contain the virus. By evaluating these situations, we can investigate whether or not the use of quarantine is justified by being either cost-saving, life saving, or both. Results Our results indicate that quarantine is effective in containing newly emerging infectious diseases, and also cost saving when compared to not implementing a widespread containment mechanism. Conclusions This paper illustrates that it is not only in our humanitarian interest for public health and healthcare officials to remain aggressive in their response to newly emerging infections, but also in our collective economic interest. Despite somewhat daunting initial costs, quarantine saves both lives and money.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Anu G.; Moyer, Cheryl A.; Stern, David T.","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/766e0afdd0d3c2a1f8d9a6c8b318ca401db0a8bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112515.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445304001859; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445304001859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["widespread quarantine","use of quarantine","economic costs","emerging infectious diseases","significant public health interventions","classic public health intervention","emerging infections","population","results","daunting initial costs","SARS outbreaks","Scenario B","widespread containment mechanism","healthcare officials","response","time","Toronto","benefits","outbreak scenarios","Abstract Objectives","attempt","virus","Conclusions","paper","life","Methods","money","situations"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay. RESULTS: Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value \u003C30). However, for Ct values \u003E30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert.

The first advance exploits the artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS). AEGIS adds nucleotides to the four found in standard DNA and RNA (xNA); AEGIS nucleotides pair orthogonally to the A:T and G:C pairs. Placing AEGIS components in the stems of molecular beacons is shown to lower noise by preventing unwanted stem invasion by adventitious natural xNA. This should improve the signal-to-noise ratio of molecular beacons operating in complex biological mixtures.

Humans may also become infected with viruses through aerosol by intruding into bat roosting caves or via direct contact with bats, such as catching bats or been bitten by bats.","publish_time":"2015-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Hui-Ju; Wen, Hong-ling; Zhou, Chuan-Min; Chen, Fang-Fang; Luo, Li-Mei; Liu, Jian-wei; Yu, Xue-Jie","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b89d0b8f0d717b692537b88dc444bd684d73426.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132474.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021500177X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021500177X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997928/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.05.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catching bats","spillover of viruses","SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","MERS-CoV","MERS coronavirus","Hendra virus","Ebola virus","Nipah virus","humans","direct contact","close contact","human infection","terrible diseases","non-human primates","recent years severe infectious diseases","bats\u2019 special social","NiV","intermediate animal hosts","horses","civets","pigs","Abstract","caves","Marburg","immunological features","aerosol","likely mode","HeV","Table","panic","world"],"language":"en"},

Interpopulational differences in genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies and in linkage disequilibrium structure for these SNPs were detected. These frequencies correlated with the ethnicity of the populations and with their supposed differential exposure to the TBE virus. In particular, the lowest frequencies of G/G genotype for OAS3 SNP rs2072136 (which, according to our earlier results, is associated with predisposition to severe forms of TBE) were found in Altaians, Khakass, Tuvinians, and Shorians, who commonly contact with the TBE virus in their habitation regions.

Many countries, including Korea, have established national infectious disease surveillance systems with clinical notification. We aimed to evaluate the National Health Insurance Claims-based Surveillance (NHICS) compared to conventional passive report-based National Infectious Diseases Surveillance (NIDS). Reported to claimed cases ratios (R/C ratio) were evaluated from monthly notifiable disease cases captured by NIDS and NHICS. The relationships between 26 infectious diseases and each surveillance system were analysed using Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis and linear regression. There was an overall increase in R/C ratio from 2010\u20132017 (0.37 to 0.78). In 22 infectious diseases, there was a correlation between NIDS and NHICS. Moreover, claim-based surveillance showed less fluctuating disease incidence rates than report-based surveillance for specific infectious diseases, such as varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever. However, for infectious diseases with episodic outbreaks or low incidence, it was difficult to assess NHICS usefulness. Claim-based surveillance is less affected by limitations of conventional report-based surveillance systems, such as reporting rate. Given delays in claim systems, a claim-based surveillance is expected to be complementary to conventional systems for the detection of various infectious diseases with the advancement of bio-information technology.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Jaehun; Im, Jae Hyoung; Ko, Young-Jin; Huh, Kyungmin; Yoon, Chang-gyo; Rhee, Chulwoo; Kim, Young-Eun; Go, Dun-Sol; Kim, Arim; Jung, Yunsun; Radnaabaatar, Munkhzul; Yoon, Seok-Jun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1843389daffca2a8b5e04048821ce881eb068269.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6584579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45409-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["claim-based surveillance","National Infectious Diseases Surveillance","national infectious disease surveillance systems","limitations of conventional report-based surveillance systems","specific infectious diseases","detection of various infectious diseases","claim systems","National Health Insurance Claims-based Surveillance","conventional systems","NIDS","NHICS usefulness","conventional passive report","C ratio","fluctuating disease incidence rates","monthly notifiable disease cases","low incidence","cases ratios","timely outbreak detection","Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis","varicella","important tool","advancement of bio","clinical notification","episodic outbreaks","linear regression","response","mumps","overall increase","Korea","scarlet fever","information technology","delays","relationships","countries"],"language":"en"},

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, what could be due to a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists, from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation of their countries, existing myths and misinformation, and the possible resources available. They were also asked to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF\u2019s were prepared based on the extant literature and the views expressed; they illustrate the epidemiology of MH issues, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans/innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and probable outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research in pandemic. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts and to develop evidence based MH interventions.

Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K-\u03B1 Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Methods Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem\u0027s library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Results Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFN\u03B2) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bansal, S.; Limaye, A.; Bharat, A.; Bremner, R.; Smith, M.; Omar, A.; Mohanakumar, T.","journal":"The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249820310032; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249820310032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVI","Kapa Biosystem","NMDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVI LTxRs","induction of exosomes","Purpose Exosomes","Methods Exosomes","role of exosomes","stable LTxRs","presence of circulating exosomes","induction of circulating exosomes","viral DNA","viral genome","lung self-antigens","STING","cGAS","ER stress","RIG1 pathways","respiratory viral infections","Hep2 cells","innate immune","unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing","presence of DNA sequences specific","donor antigens","immune responses","immune activation","lung transplant recipients","post lung transplant","RNA capable","airway epithelial cells","KCC266","endoplasmic stress","human genome","comparison","development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction","donor HLA","cell death","respiratory syncytial virus","GTPase","defensins","MAP kinase","primers","apoptotic cleavage","risk factor","IFN\u03B2","BiP","Collagen-V","MDA5","higher levels","raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads","NMDA receptor","membrane bound vesicles","antibodies","coronavirus","\u03B1 Tubulin","PERK","ATF4","MAVS","mechanism","Kapa Biosystem\u0027s library kit","CHIPseeker Database","Libraries","rhinovirus","FastQC","kits","rejection","laboratory","contrast","body fluids","upregulation of proteins","Validation","ultracentrifugation","Size","nanosight","Nanodrop","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Inflight medical issues are estimated to occur up to 350 times per day worldwide (1/14,000-40,000 passengers). Specific characteristics of the air cabin environment are associated with hypoxia and the expansion of trapped gases into body cavities, which can lead to harm. The most frequent medical events during air travel include abdominal pain; ear, nose, and throat pathologies; psychiatric disorders; and life-threatening events such as acute respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Physicians need to be aware of the management of these conditions in this unusual setting. Chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are common and are at increased risk of acute exacerbation. Physicians must be trained in these conditions and inform their patients about their prevention.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naouri, Diane; Lapostolle, Frederic; Rondet, Claire; Ganansia, Olivier; Pateron, Dominique; Yordanov, Youri","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96b6d9dc0789e90b2a82441f6967d4ace5c28f76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093858.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934316305460; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934316305460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27267286/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.05.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frequent medical events","patients","conditions","personal physicians","acute respiratory failure","medical pretravel advice","Inflight medical issues","air travel","life-threatening events","air cabin environment","increased risk of acute exacerbation","ear","abdominal pain","nose","hypoxia","throat pathologies","psychiatric disorders","expansion of trapped gases","body cavities","cardiovascular diseases","Specific characteristics","cardiac arrest","management","traveling","unusual setting","day","times","passengers","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Various porcine pathogens target macrophages, which are classical innate immune cells. Although macrophages basically protect the host from pathogens, they also seem to contribute to infectious processes. Therefore, cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens. However, the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited. In this study, we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage (IPKM) cell line, which was generated by transferring the SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase (pTERT) genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors. The IPKM displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged (doubling time: about 4 days). These cells were immunostained for macrophage markers. In addition, they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1\u03B2 were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in LPS-primed IPKM. These findings suggest that IPKM exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages. By transferring the SV40LT and pTERT genes using lentiviral vectors, we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig. These results suggest that the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages.","publish_time":"2017-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takenouchi, Takato; Kitani, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Shunichi; Nakai, Michiko; Fuchimoto, Dai-ichiro; Tsukimoto, Mitsutoshi; Shinkai, Hiroki; Sato, Mitsuru; Uenishi, Hirohide","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e881f35d3222748d7c2cb9a2a8b9b0d99246564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5566601.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPKM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immortalized macrophages","primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages","Various porcine pathogens target macrophages","infectious processes of porcine pathogens","cultured macrophages","porcine innate immunity","effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages","novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage","availability of porcine macrophage cell lines","pTERT genes","typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages","porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase","macrophage markers","LPS-primed IPKM","typical macrophage morphology","lentiviral vectors","infectious diseases","co-expression of SV40LT","inflammatory cytokines","domestic pig","classical innate immune cells","low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig","severe economic losses","peripheral blood","nigericin-induced inflammasome activation","substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads","pigs","important agricultural animal","lipopolysaccharide","global swine industry","SV40 large T antigen","secretion of interleukin","stimulation","doubling time","days","maturation","addition","results","study","findings","host","models"],"language":"en"},

To produce the virus\u2010like particle (VLP) vaccine, we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co\u2010express EV71 P1 polypeptide and 3CD protease using the Bac\u2010to\u2010Bac(\u00AE) vector system. The recombinant baculoviruses resulted in P1 cleavage by 3CD and subsequent VLP assembly in infected insect cells, but caused either low VLP yield or excessive VLP degradation. To tackle the problems, here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashBAC GOLD\u2122 vector system which was deficient in v\u2010cath and chiA genes. We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD\u2122 system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF\u2010P1\u2010C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD(TM) system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High Five(TM) cells with BacF\u2010P1\u2010C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to \u2248268 and \u2248171 mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 \u03BCg purified VLP induced cross\u2010protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (\u2248171 mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 \u03BCg VLP, one liter High Five(TM) culture produced \u224812,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines.

Presently, few studies about CAP are available from Southeast Asia. This study aimed to investigate the etiology, severity, and outcome of CAP in the most populous Southeast Asia country, Indonesia. Methods From October 2007 to April 2009, adult patients admitted with CAP to two hospitals in Semarang, Indonesia, were included to detect the etiology of CAP using a full range of diagnostic methods. The severity of disease was classified according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). The outcome was assessed as 30-day mortality. Results In total, 148 consecutive patients with CAP were included. Influenza virus (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%) were the most common agents identified. Other Gram-negative bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae each accounted for 5%. The bacteria presented wild type antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Forty-four percent of subjects were high-risk patients (PSI class IV-V). The mortality rate (30%) was significantly associated with disease severity score (P\u003C0.001), and with failure to establish an etiological diagnosis (P=0.027). No associations were found between etiology and underlying diseases, PSI class, nor mortality. Conclusions Viruses and Gram-negative bacilli are dominant causes of CAP in this region, more so than S. pneumoniae. Most of the bacteria have wild type susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Patients with severe disease and those with unknown etiology have a higher mortality risk.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farida, Helmia; Gasem, M.

The routine detection and diagnosis of BCoV have been mainly dependent on assays with low sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a semi-nested PCR (SN-PCR) to amplify a 251bp fragment of BCoV N gene from fresh (n =25) and frozen (n =25) diarrhoeic faecal samples of naturally infected calves. To improve detection of BCoV in faecal samples by the SN-PCR an internal control was developed, and the results were compared with a conventional RT-PCR assay. The rates of positive samples by SN-PCR and RT-PCR were 24% (12/50) and 8% (4/50), respectively (K =0.43). Only fresh samples were positive in RT-PCR while the SN-PCR detected BCoV in both fresh and frozen faecal samples. The sensitivity of SN-PCR was determined by 10-fold serial dilutions of the BCoV Kakegawa strain (HA titre: 256) that was detected until 10\u22127 dilution. The specificity of the amplicons was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis. The inclusion of an internal control provides a way to detect assay inhibition in faecal samples and failure of nucleic acid extraction that allow reduction of the number of false-negative results.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takiuchi, Elisabete; Stipp, Danilo T.; Alfieri, Alice F.; Alfieri, Amauri A.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74d11583251ebe5e9e139b0bd881244fa1c5965f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112777.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340500265X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340500265X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SN-PCR","fresh samples","detection of BCoV","frozen faecal samples","conventional RT-PCR assay","diarrhoeic faecal samples","semi-nested PCR","diagnosis of BCoV","sensitivity of SN","rates of positive samples","BCoV Kakegawa strain","bp fragment of BCoV N gene","internal control","infected calves","assay inhibition","negative results","routine detection","low sensitivity","positive sense single-stranded RNA virus","restriction fragment length polymorphism","important causative agent of neonatal diarrhoea","failure of nucleic acid extraction","reduction","beef","sequence analysis","fold serial dilutions","way","number of false","amplicons","HA titre","assays","dairy cattle","Abstract Bovine coronavirus","present study","aim","inclusion","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (VRP 3526). Using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the VRP 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. Importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions distinguishes VRP 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. In addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated VRP approaches. Taking these results together, the VRP 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under BSL2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. IMPORTANCE While VEE virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. In this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. Importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. Together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.","publish_time":"2018-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Menachery, Vineet D.; Yount, Boyd L.; Lindesmith, Lisa C.; Scobey, Trevor; Whitmore, Alan; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e142106dccc14c30910e705e1159d340c6a97832.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5952155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00027-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated vaccine","alphavirus replicon vaccine platform","virus vaccine","new replicon platform","attenuated replicon platforms","attenuated VRP approaches","established platform","VEE virus replicon particles","effective vaccine platforms","safe system","portable system","production of virus","new system","level facilities","biosafety level","BSL2 conditions","wild-type replicon particle","reported alphavirus platforms","utility","heterologous challenge","improved efficacy","packaging","work","generation of candidate vaccines","lower biocontainment level","generation of recombinant proteins","context of disease emergence","aged mice","capable of use","improved outcomes","Zoonotic viruses","emergent viruses","emergence situations","vulnerable aged models","Venezuelan equine encephalitis","non-select agent","equal protection","antigen expression","capacity","approach accessible","animal reservoirs","vaccination","emerging microbial pathogens","characterization","high-containment","epidemics","majority of laboratories","model systems","swarms","requirement","IMPORTANCE","human populations","noroviruses","coronaviruses","addition","outbreak","public health","world","results"],"language":"en"},

The current COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. The aim of this study was to assess the information available on national and international aesthetic surgery society websites on the current pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: National and international aesthetic surgery society websites were assessed with regard to COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thirty-one per cent of nations had aesthetic surgery society websites. Twenty-two per cent of national society websites had a specific COVID-19 section. Seventeen per cent of these websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available; of these websites with guidelines, 77% had a specific COVID-19 section advising to provide only urgent or emergent care and 46% provided their sovereign state\u2019s directives to provide only urgent or emergent care. Two international aesthetic surgery society websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines, and one of the two had significant educational resources. CONCLUSION: The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is sparse. In contrast, one international society website carefully analysed national and international recommendations and guidelines and made general recommendations for its members with regularly updated resources. This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national aesthetic surgery society websites may be improved by links to the ISAPS website.

It enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and utilizes small GTPase Rab proteins such as PmRab5 and PmRab7 for intracellular trafficking. In this study, molecular cloning and functional analysis of Rab11 during YHV infection were investigated. PmRab11 cDNA was cloned by Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACEs). It contained two forms of sizes 1200 and 1050 bp distinct at the 5\u02B9 UTR. The coding region of PmRab11 was 645 bp, encoding 214 amino acids. It also demonstrated the characteristics of Rab11 proteins containing five GTP-binding domains, five Rab family domains, four Rab subfamily domains and a prenylation site at the C-terminus. Suppression of PmRab11 using dsRNA-PmRab11 either before or after YHV-challenge resulted in significant inhibition of YHV levels in the hemocytes and viral release in the supernatant in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the silencing effect of PmRab11 in YHV-infected shrimps resulted in a delay in shrimp mortality for at least 2 days. Immunofluorescence study showed co-localization between PmRab11 and YHV at 24\u201372 h post YHV-challenge. In contrast, the co-localization signals were absence in the PmRab11 knockdown hemocytes and the YHV signals accumulated at the perinuclear region at 24 h post YHV-challenge. Then, accumulation of YHV was hardly observed after 48\u201372 h. These results suggested that PmRab11 is required for YHV infection in shrimp.","publish_time":"2017-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kongprajug, Akechai; Panyim, Sakol; Ongvarrasopone, Chalermporn","journal":"Fish Shellfish Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acda4c9fcee2ee798161bba682e06285961a4bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527895/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105046481730284X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.05.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105046481730284X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rab"],"organizations":["YHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YHV signals","YHV infection","accumulation of YHV","PmRab11 cDNA","Suppression of PmRab11","dsRNA-PmRab11","h post YHV-challenge","YHV-infected shrimps","significant inhibition of YHV levels","PmRab11 knockdown hemocytes","coding region of PmRab11","silencing effect of PmRab11","Rab subfamily domains","Rab family domains","co-localization signals","shrimp mortality","small GTPase Rab proteins","GTP-binding domains","characteristics of Rab11 proteins","perinuclear region","bp distinct","worldwide shrimp production loss","protein levels","Immunofluorescence study","functional analysis of Rab11","Rapid amplification of cDNA ends","PmRab5","supernatant","prenylation site","absence","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","molecular cloning","PmRab7","viral release","serious pathogens","mRNA","RACEs","delay","intracellular trafficking","C-terminus","cells","5\u02B9 UTR","addition","Yellow head virus","contrast","forms of sizes","amino acids","days","results"],"language":"en"},

The assay is based on primer-probe energy transfer, and the most important advantage of this is the relative tolerance towards mutations in the target-probe region. The primers and the probe were designed using an alignment of 235 Type 1 (including all subtypes) and Type 2 PRRSV strains. According to the alignment, multiple degenerations were included in the forward and reverse primers to enable the detection of all PRRSV strains deposited in the GenBank. Specificity was tested using 37 different PRRSV strains and eight other swine pathogen viruses. The detection limit was approximately 10 copies of RNA prepared from the Lelystad virus, a European Subtype 3 virus (Belarus strain Soz-8), and an American vaccine virus (Ingelvac MLV\u00AE). One TCID50 was the detection limit in the case of the cell cultured Lelystad virus and an American wild type isolate, respectively. The melting point analysis revealed melting point decrease, but no significant sensitivity and signal loss in the presence of numerous (up to five) target-probe mismatches, indicating the capability of tolerating even more mutations. The method was suitable for the detection and quantitation of phylogenetically divergent strains and can serve as a robust, high throughput tool for molecular diagnosis of the PRRSV.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balka, Gyula; Horny\u00E1k, \u00C1kos; B\u00E1lint, \u00C1d\u00E1m; Benyeda, Zs\u00F3fia; Rusvai, Mikl\u00F3s","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8a9831c00106017c617e0491df9dba67c19f115.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112897.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.01.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409000159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200443/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409000159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank","European Subtype"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection limit","different PRRSV strains","simultaneous detection","American vaccine virus","divergent strains","respiratory syndrome virus","target-probe mismatches","target-probe region","cell cultured Lelystad virus","mutations","alignment","American wild type isolate","primer-probe energy transfer","melting point decrease","melting point analysis","reverse primers","one-step real-time RT-PCR method","genotypes of porcine reproductive","European Subtype","significant sensitivity","case","molecular diagnosis","high throughput tool","signal loss","Belarus strain Soz","relative tolerance","important advantage","presence of numerous","forward","Ingelvac MLV","swine pathogen viruses","quantitation","copies of RNA","subtypes","capability of tolerating","multiple degenerations","assay","Specificity","TCID50","GenBank"],"language":"en"},

Acceptability, symptom duration and viral shedding were secondary outcomes. Participants maintained a symptom diary until well for two days or a maximum of 14 days and collected 5 sequential mid-turbinate swabs to measure viral shedding.

A range of novel therapies are emerging to treat asthma and in particular target this group with poor disease control, and in most cases their efficacy is now being judged by their ability to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations. Critical for the development of new treatment approaches is an improved understanding of virus-host interaction in the context of the asthmatic airway. This requires research into the virology of the disease in physiological models in conjunction with detailed phenotypic characterisation of asthma patients to identify targets amenable to therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tay, Hock; Wark, Peter A.

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 \u00D7 10(9)/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Yi; Xiong, Chang; Liu, Yuquan; Qian, Xin; Tang, Yijun; Liu, Liang; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Wang, Meifang","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27964e8b3f8b3088b382c0cc647a2ddb6228b20c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191275.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360481/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311294?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Taihe Hospital","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical characteristics of patients","percentage of critical patients","epidemiological characteristics of patients","critical cases","severe cases","higher proportion of diabetes patients","critical outcomes","confirmed cases","early diagnosis","Wuhan personnel","critical groups","critical condition","initial diagnosis","regional cases","Wuhan city","clinical characteristics analysis","time of diagnosis","histories of Wuhan residences","clinical manifestations","imaging characteristics","Patient follow-up","progression risk","lower proportion of smokers","ordinary group","family clustering","days","Shiyan experience","allocation of clinical resources","main symptoms","new COVID","later period","investigated COVID","longest incubation period","poor outcomes","Q-PCR test","poor outcome group","multiple patchy ground glass shadows","multiple swaps","nucleic acid Q-PCR","early stage","risk factors","current smokers","decreased lymphocytes","patient lungs","absolute number of lymphocytes","Multivariate regression analysis","single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow","low white blood cell","timely treatment","areas","enhanced vascular bundles","history of close contact","underlying diseases","Taihe Hospital","CT scans","Hubei Province","common comorbidities","healthy people","median interval","death rate","hypertension","admission","fever","smoking","CONCLUSION","ICU","virulence","parameter of lymphocyte","outbreaks","METHODS","evidence","study","co-morbidities","incidence","AIM","cough","RESULTS","world"],"language":"en"},

Precision public health is a state-of-the-art concept in public health research and its application in health care. Application of information technology in field of epidemiology paves the way to its transformation to digital epidemiology. A geospatial epidemiological model was simulated to estimate the spread of Ebola virus disease after a hypothetical outbreak in India. Methods. It was a simulation study based on SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. Simulation was done in Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM). Epidemiological profile of Ebola virus, that transmitted throughout the Sierra Leon in 2014\u20132016, was fitted into the SEIR deterministic compartment model designed for India. Result. Spatiotemporal distribution of EVD exposed, infectious, and recovered population at 4-month interval represented by different figures. It is estimated that if no intervention is taken to stop the spread, within 2 years, almost half of the country will be effected by EVD and cumulative number of exposed individuals, infectious persons, and deaths will be 106947760, 30651674, and 18391005, respectively.

We demonstrated that binding of nsp4 with nsp3 is essential for membrane rearrangement and identified amino acid residues in nsp4 responsible for the interaction with nsp3. In addition, we revealed that the nsp3-nsp4 interaction is not sufficient to induce membrane rearrangement, suggesting the participation of other factors such as host proteins.

The Jordan Ministry of Health, in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, started the Jordan FETP (J-FETP) in 1998. Since then, it has achieved a high standard of success and has been established as a model for FETPs in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Here we describe the J-FETP, its role in building the epidemiologic capacity of Jordan\u2019s public health workforce, and its activities and achievements, which have grown the program to be self-sustaining within the Jordan Ministry of Health. Since its inception, the program\u2019s residents and graduates have assisted the country to improve its surveillance systems, including revising the mortality surveillance policy, implementing the use of electronic data reporting, investigating outbreaks at national and regional levels, contributing to noncommunicable disease research and surveillance, and responding to regional emergencies and disasters. J-FETP\u2019s structure and systems of support from the Jordan Ministry of Health and local, regional, and international partners have contributed to the success and sustainability of the J-FETP.

Distinguishing between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) remains challenging. Transcriptional profiling is a promising tool for improving diagnosis in LRTI. Methods. We performed whole blood transcriptional analysis in 118 patients (median age [interquartile range], 61 [50\u201376] years) hospitalized with LRTI and 40 age-matched healthy controls (median age, 60 [46\u201370] years). We applied class comparisons, modular analysis, and class prediction algorithms to identify and validate diagnostic biosignatures for bacterial and viral LRTI. Results. Patients were classified as having bacterial (n = 22), viral (n = 71), or bacterial-viral LRTI (n = 25) based on comprehensive microbiologic testing. Compared with healthy controls, statistical group comparisons (P \u003C .01; multiple-test corrections) identified 3376 differentially expressed genes in patients with bacterial LRTI, 2391 in viral LRTI, and 2628 in bacterial-viral LRTI. Patients with bacterial LRTI showed significant overexpression of inflammation and neutrophil genes (bacterial \u003E bacterial-viral \u003E viral), and those with viral LRTI displayed significantly greater overexpression of interferon genes (viral \u003E bacterial-viral \u003E bacterial). The K\u2013nearest neighbors algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that discriminated between bacterial and viral LRTI with a 95% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 77%\u2013100%) and 92% specificity (77%\u201398%), compared with a sensitivity of 38% (18%\u201362%) and a specificity of 91% (76%\u201398%) for procalcitonin.

Examination of the FCoV genome has shown that the same strain of virus can produce different clinical manifestations, suggesting that host genetic factors may also play a role in the outcome of infection. FIP is most prevalent amongst pedigree cats, although how much of this is due to them living in large groups (leading to higher virus challenge and stress which predisposes to FIP) and how much is due to genetic susceptibility is not known. If host genetics could be shown to play a role in disease, it may allow the detection of cats with a susceptibility to FIP and the development of increased population resistance through selective breeding. The feline leucocyte antigen (FLA) complex contains many genes that are central to the control of the immune response. In this preliminary study, we used clonal sequence analysis or reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA) to analyse the class II FLA\u2013DRB of 25 cats for which the outcome of FCoV exposure was known. Individual cats were shown to have between two and six FLA\u2013DRB alleles. There was no statistically significant association between the number of alleles and the outcome of FCoV infection. No particular allele appeared to be associated with either the development of FIP, resistance to FCoV, or the carrier status. However, the analysis was complicated by apparent breed variation in FLA\u2013DRB and the small number of individuals in this study.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addie, Diane D; Kennedy, Lorna J; Ryvar, Ruth; Willoughby, K; Gaskell, R.

The roles of emergency nurses are evolving and triggered by three major historical milestones. The three milestones consist of: (1) Transition of nursing education from hospital training to nursing degree program at universities in 1990; (2) The re-evolution after the establishment of Hospital Authority in 1993; (3) Hong Kong\u2019s return to China in 1997. These milestones have contributed immensely to the development of quality nursing education, nursing professionalism with emphasis on specialty knowledge and skill training in Accident and Emergency departments (AED) in Hong Kong. Since 1991, the emergency nursing role has been expanded and extended. Wound management remains one of the major extending roles for emergency nurses, who confine themselves to manage simple wounds. Nurse initiated tetanus immunization, intravenous access; investigations such as electrocardiogram, blood glucose, and urinalysis are well implemented in all AEDs under the governance of guidelines and protocols. Initial triage analgesic for the minor musculoskeletal injury and fever are also part of the triage care in some AEDs in Hong Kong now. To meet the demand and challenge, innovative role development such as lecturer practitioners and emergency nurse practitioners have been piloted and implemented recently. Besides the normal duty, emergency nurses also participate in the work outside the hospitals such as involvement in emergency medical teams to assist in various rescue missions or volunteer for Flight Nursing (Government Flying Services). However, the nursing shortage is another common problem faced by the Hong Kong health care body. With the help of advanced technology, better pre-graduate and specialty-training programs, Hong Kong health care strives to achieve the highest standards of quality care. Emergency nursing role development in Hong Kong is evolving and starts to chart its way to meet the demand.","publish_time":"2008-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Eliza Mi-Ling; Lau, Ping Fat","journal":"International Emergency Nursing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6250133744275008b7aaa0007875fdca93290e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519054/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755599X07001164; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755599X07001164; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2007.11.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hospital Authority"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Emergency nursing role development","experience of emergency nursing development","Flight Nursing","nursing professionalism","nursing shortage","Emergency departments","roles of emergency nurses","emergency nurse practitioners","development of quality nursing education","Transition of nursing education","Hong Kong health care body","nursing degree program","emergency medical teams","triage care","Hong Kong\u2019s return","innovative role development","hospital training","specialty-training programs","skill training","related roles","highest standards of quality care","major extending roles","AEDs","demand","major historical milestones","specialty knowledge","lecturer practitioners","Initial triage analgesic","establishment of Hospital Authority","emphasis","better pre-graduate","investigations","Accident","various rescue missions","electrocardiogram","intravenous access","volunteer","minor musculoskeletal injury","common problem","help of advanced technology","tetanus immunization","involvement","blood glucose","urinalysis","fever","hospitals","Government","work","universities","challenge","readers","re-evolution","governance of guidelines","China","Services","normal duty","Wound management","protocols","simple wounds","paper","way"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of PEDV presents strong immunogenicity and contributes to the cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV.

Here, two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to the N protein of a PEDV strain, FJzz1/2011, were generated and screened against a partially overlapping library of 24 GST-fusion N protein-truncated constructs.

Sequence analysis revealed that these two epitopes were highly conserved among PEDV strains but were significantly different from other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily. Western blot analysis showed that they could be specifically recognized by PEDV antisera but could not be recognized by TGEV hyperimmune antisera. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) assays confirmed no cross-reaction between these two MAbs and TGEV. In addition, the freeze-thaw cycle and protease treatment results indicated that NEP-D4 was intrinsically disordered. All these results suggest that these two novel epitopes and their cognate MAbs could serve as the basis for the development of precise diagnostic assays for PEDV.","publish_time":"2016-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Kang; Xie, Chun; Zhang, Jianan; Zhang, Wenchao; Yang, Deqiang; Yu, Lingxue; Jiang, Yifeng; Yang, Shen; Gao, Fei; Yang, Zhibiao; Zhou, Yanjun; Tong, Guangzhi","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31ce4647dd3ce32716212b10cfa8b05724dc32fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5171872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep39010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","TGEV","PEDV N","Coronavirinae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV N protein","PEDV antisera","PEDV strains","nucleocapsid protein","MAbs PN-D4","designated NEP-D4","novel epitopes","characterization of epitopes","cognate MAbs","designated NEP-D6","GST-fusion N protein-truncated constructs","PN-D6","residues","TGEV hyperimmune antisera","severe diarrhea","Sequence analysis","protease treatment results","Western blot analysis","development of precise diagnostic assays","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","freeze-thaw cycle","death","basis","contagious coronavirus","strong immunogenicity","IFA","cross-reactivity","cross-reaction","overlapping library","members","addition","Indirect immunofluorescence","monoclonal antibodies","FJzz1","Coronavirinae subfamily","neonatal piglets"],"language":"en"},

Such region contains a pair of Serum Responsive Elements (SRE), an Ets-Binding Site (EBS) and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE). In this study, we show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind these regulatory elements of the apoD promoter. Specific binding of HnRNP-U and Parp-1 was confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). In a biotin pull-down assay, Kif4 and BUB-3 bind preferentially the SRE1 and the EBS-GRE sites, respectively, while APEX-1 seems recruited indirectly to these elements. We found that the mRNA expression of some of these binding factors is upregulated in growth-arrested cells and that these proteins also transactivate the apoD promoter. In agreement with these results, mutants of APEX-1 and of Parp-1 defective for their DNA-binding and catalytic activities could not transactivate the promoter. The knockdown of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U and the use of specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 and of Parp-1 also inhibited the induction of apoD gene expression. Moreover, ERK1/2 was found activated in a biphasic manner post serum-starvation and the inhibition of Parp-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK2 but not ERK1 for up to 2h. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities in the growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levros, Louis-Charles; Carmo, Sonia Do; Edouard, Elsy; Legault, Philippe; Charfi, Cyndia; Rassart, Eric","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1c4f431dbe459fc4023a193698d0a46020dcca6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493910/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488910001369; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.04.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488910001369","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Serum Responsive Elements","Glucocorticoid Responsive Element"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoD promoter","apoD mRNA expression","inhibition of Parp","importance of Parp","knockdown of Parp","Specific binding of HnRNP","induction of apoD gene expression","DNA-binding","binding factors","growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression","HnRNP-U","ERK1","specific binding of nuclear proteins","mutants of APEX","growth-arrested cells","Ets-Binding Site","BUB","pair of Serum Responsive Elements","catalytic activities","Kif4","regulatory elements","region","EBS-GRE sites","use of specific inhibitors of MEK1","Glucocorticoid Responsive Element","biotin pull-down assay","Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay","biphasic manner post serum-starvation","pathological situations","neurodegenerative diseases","EMSA","stress conditions","Abstract Human Apolipoprotein D","SRE1","Ifi204","sustained activation of ERK2","cancers","results","CBF","agreement","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of \u0022COVID\u002B units\u0022. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Lapr\u00E9vote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370982/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","China"],"keyphrases":["health of patients","mental health care","population of patients","acute mental disorders","recurrences of mental disorders","mental health community facilities","mental health healthcare system","French mental healthcare","high densities of patients","behavioural disorders","epidemic of emotional disorders","partial closure of community mental health facilities","experience of confinement","continuity of psychiatric care","intensive care units","psychiatric hospitals","psychiatric establishments","psychiatric institution","medical literature","medical check-ups","medical teams","medical comorbidities","stress management","major issues","barrier measures","hygiene measures","pandemic situation","close psychological support","general population","support platforms","healthcare systems","France","compulsory ambulatory care situations","context of major shortages of organizational","coronavirus epidemic raises concerns","specific case-management","SARS-CoV epidemic","types of major vulnerabilities","possibility of home visits","coping strategies","specific training","regular follow-up","risk factors","relevant results","human resources","severe covid","lack of resources","coming days","infectious diseases","Family visits","psycho-education strategies","psychological risks inherent","infectious disease specialist","monitoring of suicide risk","dramatic experience of famine","maintenance of regular sleep r","early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder","social interactions","physical exercise","pulmonary pathologies","certain number of structural aspects","narrative review","new entrants","internist","prevalence","material","nursing staff","crucial role of information","coordination","compliance","result of stigmatization","local initiatives","authors","diabetes","infection","telemedicine","quarantine","memories","obesity","Current government plans","regions of China","prevention of addictions","weeks","elderly form","beds","wards","total","guidance","Private practice psychiatrists","country","psychosocial vulnerability","dual supervision","urgent need","reorganization","addition","World War","directions","creation","Discussion","socio-economic difficulties","end of hospitalization","Methods","Objective","article","videoconference"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we compared the phosphorylation status of Akt during infection of MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain HuN4. We observed that biphasic activation of Akt was induced in at both the early stage (5, 15 and 30 min postinfection) and the late stage (12 and 24 h postinfection) of HP-PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells, while an early-phase activation of Akt was found exclusively in virus-infected PAMs in vitro. Analysis with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 confirmed that PI3K acted as the upstream activator for the virus-induced activation of Akt. UV-irradiation-inactivated virus still induced the early event in PAMs but not in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that different mechanisms are employed for the early-stage induction of phosphorylated Akt within different cell cultures. We further demonstrated that FoxO1 and Bad, which serve as downstream targets of Akt, were phosphorylated in virus-infected MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the suppression of phosphorylated Akt with LY294002 significantly inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells, but it had a negligible effect on virus propagation. Collectively, our data provide new evidence of a novel role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells.","publish_time":"2013-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Liqian; Yang, Shen; Tong, Wu; Zhu, Jianping; Yu, Hai; Zhou, Yanjun; Morrison, Robert B.; Tong, Guangzhi","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc954a90b7d4b595600da69a1afac9f8f0a7d075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087347.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1620-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23381397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cells","Akt pathway","virus-induced activation of Akt","virus-infected MARC","suppression of phosphorylated Akt","biphasic activation of Akt","early-phase activation of Akt","early-stage induction of phosphorylated Akt","HP-PRRSV infection of MARC","phosphorylation status of Akt","downstream targets of Akt","virus-infected PAMs","inactivated virus","virus propagation","early stage","pathogenic PRRSV","early event","PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002","late stage","h postinfection","different mechanisms","negligible effect","cytopathic effect","different cell cultures","important cellular pathway","novel role","porcine alveolar macrophages","CPE","upstream activator","various replication steps of multiple viruses","new evidence","strain HuN4","data","Analysis","UV-irradiation","kinase","present study","Phosphatidylinositol","FoxO1"],"language":"en"},

Precise etiologic diagnosis in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains challenging. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of CAP etiology in 2 groups of pediatric patients who underwent flexible bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); children with acute nonresponsive CAP (NR-CAP; n = 127) or recurrent CAP (Rec-CAP; n = 123). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cutoff point, \u226510(4) colony-forming units/mL) was used. Blood culture results, serological test results, nasopharyngeal secretion findings, and pleural fluid culture results were also assessed, where available. Results. An infectious agent was detected in 76.0% of cases. In 51.2% of infections, aerobic bacteria were isolated, of which 75.0%, 28.9%, and 13.3% were Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Most (97.9%) of the H. influenzae strains were nontypeable (NTHi). H. influenzae was detected in 26.0% of NR-CAP cases and 51.2% of Rec-CAP cases, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in the NR-CAP group (accounting for 34.9% of cases) but not in the Rec-CAP group (19.3%). Viruses were found in 30.4% of cases, with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenzaviruses detected most frequently. Mixed infections were found in 18.9% of NR-CAP cases and 30.1% of Rec-CAP cases. Conclusions. A variety of microorganisms were isolated with frequent mixed infection. NTHi was one of the major pathogens found, especially in association with recurrent CAP, possibly because of improved detection with the FOB with BAL procedure. This suggests that the burden of pediatric CAP could be reduced by addressing NTHi as a major causative pathogen.","publish_time":"2011-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Schutter, Iris; De Wachter, Elke; Crokaert, Fran\u00E7oise; Verhaegen, Jan; Soetens, Oriane; Pi\u00E9rard, Denis; Malfroot, Anne","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/646e1563272926efc0d7100555511eb7b4b98aa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107807.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21628484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rec-CAP cases","NR-CAP cases","recurrent CAP","Rec-CAP group","NR-CAP group","burden of pediatric CAP","acute nonresponsive CAP","retrospective study of CAP etiology","NTHi","Blood culture results","pleural fluid culture results","quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid","serological test results","BAL procedure","FOB","pediatric community","Haemophilus influenzae","influenzae strains","Mixed infections","groups of pediatric patients","major causative pathogen","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","predominant pathogen","Streptococcus pneumoniae","major pathogens","frequent mixed infection","nasopharyngeal secretion findings","children","contamination risk","flexible bronchoscopy","bronchoalveolar lavage","improved detection","Moraxella catarrhalis","significance cutoff point","respiratory syncytial virus","Precise etiologic diagnosis","parainfluenzaviruses","association","accounting","variety of microorganisms","aerobic bacteria","Procedural measures","colony","units","infectious agent","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The tumor antigens are expressed during early stages of the viral life cycle and are implicated in the regulation of viral transcription and DNA replication, while the capsid proteins are produced later during infection. Members of the Polyomaviridae family have been isolated in birds (Avipolyomavirus) and mammals (Orthopolyomavirus and Wukipolyomavirus). Some mammalian polyomaviruses encode an additional protein, referred to as agnoprotein, which is a relatively small polypeptide that exerts multiple functions.

However, cisplatin resistance is still a challenging issue, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be fully explored. CLEC4M, a Ca(2\u002B)-dependent C-type lectin, has recently been found to correlate with tumourigenesis. This study mainly focused on whether CLEC4M impacts clinical prognosis and how CLEC4M contributes to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Our results found that CLEC4M was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In addition, a positive association between CLEC4M expression and the IC50 values of cisplatin was found, which suggests that CLEC4M may impact cisplatin sensitivity. In vitro results from cultured A549 and H1299 cells confirmed that CLEC4M could enhance cisplatin resistance, while CLEC4M knockdown led to higher sensitivity to cisplatin in these cells. Further experiments showed that the underlying mechanisms included inhibition of cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis by CLEC4M and improved DNA repair capacity by upregulating XPA and ERCC1 expression. In addition, CLEC4M was able to promote cell migration with or without cisplatin treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential clinical significance of CLEC4M inhibition in overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC patients.","publish_time":"2019-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Li-Ming; Li, Xi; Qiu, Cheng-Feng; Zhu, Tao; Hu, Cheng-Ping; Yin, Ji-Ye; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Hong-Hao; Liu, Zhao-Qian","journal":"J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e9d0220802e3e3fba0b25f1e2cd46b9412c4317.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6856750.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.30139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLEC4M expression","CLEC4M knockdown","inhibition of cisplatin","cisplatin treatment","cisplatin sensitivity","overcoming cisplatin resistance","CLEC4M impacts clinical prognosis","IC50 values of cisplatin","Cisplatin-based chemotherapy","potential clinical significance of CLEC4M inhibition","NSCLC patients","cell migration","underlying mechanisms","results","addition","induced cell apoptosis","major non-small cell lung cancer","foundation of treatment","ERCC1 expression","poor prognosis","H1299 cells","molecular mechanisms","higher sensitivity","improved DNA repair capacity","upregulating XPA","challenging issue","cultured A549","positive association","dependent C-type lectin","findings","experiments","study","tumourigenesis"],"language":"en"},

Here, these encouraging results are reviewed together along with discussion of the desirable advantages of the PIV5 vaccine vector to aid future vaccine design and to accelerate progression of PIV5\u2010based vaccines into clinical trials.","publish_time":"2018-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhenhai","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3e48841747b33e9660801a34de2c13e93482802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29316047/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rabies virus","PIV5 vaccine vector","canine parainfluenza virus","progression of PIV5","respiratory syncytial virus","stranded RNA virus","prior exposure of PIV5","vectored vaccine","live vaccine","based vaccines","future vaccine design","excellent viral vector","robust immunity","protective immune responses","years","preclinical animal models","veterinary field","dogs","ability","kennel cough","desirable advantages","cell types","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","genome","sense","clinical trials","presence of foreign gene insertions","Paramyxoviridae family","high titers","safety concern","discussion","encouraging results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that type I interferon (IFN) induction but not its downstream signaling is blocked by HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. This effect may be partially due to HBV X protein (HBx), which impairs IFN\u03B2 promoter activation by both Sendai virus (SeV) and components implicated in signaling by viral sensors. As a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), HBx cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from many proteins except TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). It binds and deconjugates retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG I) and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), causing their dissociation from the downstream adaptor CARDIF or TBK1 kinase. In addition to RIG I and TRAF3, HBx also interacts with CARDIF, TRIF, NEMO, TBK1, inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase epsilon (IKKi) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Our data indicate that multiple points of signaling pathways can be targeted by HBx to negatively regulate production of type I IFN.

Infectious virus was released from the cells within 7 days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infections exceeded one. Occasionally 10\u201320% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3 9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.","publish_time":"1989-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aroonprasert, Daranai; Fagerland, Jane A.; Kelso, Nancy E.; Zheng, Shilun; Woode, Gerald N.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1861ea484d4ee2f1b53810f1d5d00e9871577fe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378113589900771; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0378113589900771","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NBK","TCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fecal astrovirus","NBK cell cultures","NBK cultures","passage infected cells","TCA astrovirus","ultrastructural studies of infected cells","minority of cells","Infectious virus","bovine cell lines","indication of viral infection","days post-infection","Abstract Bovine astrovirus serotype","cell culture types","h post-infection","primary neonatal kidney cell","tissue culture","selective cell tropism","Primary embryo bovine kidney","similar distributions","EBK","time-related development of infection","later passages","nucleoli","expression of viral antigens","viral antigen foci","early passages","absence of trypsin","Masses of virions","nuclear phase of replication","diffuse faint immunofluorescence","US2","neutralization test","electron microscopy","discrete areas","essential lipids","chloroform","iododeoxyuridine","envelope","actinomycin D","appearance","calves","RNA genome","DNA inhibitors","treatment","\u03BCg","addition","conclusion","mean diameter","perinuclear region","granules","nm","multiplicity of infections","cytoplasmic area","nucleus","Infectivity","proportion"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to analyze the initial velocity and the angle of the exhaled airflow from coughing and speaking of 17 males and 9 females using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and acrylic indoor chamber. The results showed that the average initial coughing velocity was 15.3m/s for the males and 10.6m/s for the females, while the average initial speaking velocity was 4.07m/s and 2.31m/s respectively. The angle of the exhaled air from coughing was around 38\u00B0 for the males and 32\u00B0 for the females, while that of the exhaled air from speaking was around 49\u00B0 and 78\u00B0 respectively.

At 30 dpi, virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of PEDV and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated. We found that PEDV RNA persists in the intestine even after fecal shedding of the virus was stopped at 28 dpi and pigs previously exposed to PEDV are protected from virus shedding after re-infection. PEDV infection induced both humoral and cell mediated immune response with an increase in PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibodies in intestine and serum. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of B cells and lower frequency of T cells at 4 dpi. The frequency of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) memory T cells was significantly increased in the MLN of challenged animals.

Overall, the air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the transportation sector was linked to the NO2 emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries were the major cause for the reductions of PM2.5 and CO. The reduction in SO2 concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O3 actually increased, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO2 and as a result greater O3 production. These results also highlight need to control emissions from the residential sector.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yichen; Yuan, Yuan; Wang, Qiyuan; Liu, ChenGuang; Zhi, Qiang; Cao, Junji","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f89e08a6cf6e218e640ae8781a69f2e06fe813ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202850.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326504; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139133; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326504?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["lower emissions","reduced emissions","air pollutants","air pollution","reductions of PM2","transportation sector","air quality index","air quality improved","NO2 emission reductions","SO2 concentrations","Covid","control period","residential sector","result greater O3 production","secondary industrial sectors","secondary industries","diminished factory production","lower fine particle loadings","major cause","scavenging of HO2","road","number of vehicles","changes","PM10","AQI","northern China","disease","study","novel coronavirus","Abstract Measures","results"],"language":"en"},

This fatal disease is caused by JE Virus (JEV). The current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent JEV. Based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches, octapeptide B-cell and hexapeptide T-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins, viz. E, prM, NS1, NS3 and NS5 of JEV were determined. Hydrophilicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated. Further, the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, e.g. total net charges, amino acid composition and Boman index. Out of all the epitopes, a total of four T-cell epitopes namely KRADSS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR and KECPDE and one B-cell epitope i.e. PKPCSKGD were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen. Taking into account the outcome of this study, the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against JEV. The peptide vaccine, being cost effective, could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in JEV infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population. However, prior to administration into human beings, the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakraborty, Supriyo; Barman, Antara; Deb, Bornali","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1163230242bf54779c5e9bd79ab5a1afcfc14810.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106040.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134819303326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31706079/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819303326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.104106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified epitopes","hexapeptide T-cell epitopes","B-cell epitope","NS5 of JEV","multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine","human population","octapeptide B-cell","JEV infected individuals","JE Virus","survival rate of human beings","current study","total net charges","amino acid composition","aliphatic amino acids","silico approaches","KECPDE","spread","KRADSS","different physicochemical parameters","carrier protein","prM","antigenicity","immunogenicity","NS1","NS3","SKRSRR","KRSRRS","Boman index","serious leading health complication","prophylactic measure","efforts","adjuvant","proteins","PKPCSKGD","reverse vaccinology","pharmaceutical industries","Hydrophilicity","outcome","immunity","potential","fatal disease","administration","Japanese encephalitis","account","pathogen","clinical trials"],"language":"en"},

However, guiding elements in a network is difficult because of their complex and dynamic states. In a bid to address the issues involved in achieving network-wide outcomes, our work here sheds new light on quantifying structural efficiency to control inter-organizational networks maintained by public research institutions. In doing so, we draw attention to the set of subordinates suitable as change initiators to influence the entire research profiles of subordinates from three major public research institutions: the Government-funded Research Institutes (GRIs) in Korea, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) in Germany, and the National Laboratories (NLs) in the United States. Building networks on research similarities in portfolios, we investigate these networks with respect to their structural efficiency and topological properties. According to our estimation, only less than 30% of nodes are sufficient to initiate a cascade of changes throughout the network across institutions.

At the clinical level, HMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years. Here, we carried out a retrospective pilot study, based on the processing of nasopharyngeal swabs, with a focus on the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of HMPV in Senegal. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016. Briefly, all outpatients presenting to healthcare sentinel sites were screened for surveillance enrollment and included if they met criteria for ILI. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible participants. For viral respiratory pathogens detection, including HMPV, the Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 Detection kit was used. A fragment of the hMPV F gene was targeted for sequencing. RESULTS: In total, 8209 patients with ILI were enrolled. Half of them (49.7%) were children under 5 years. Fever was the most common symptom followed by cough, and rhinitis. Three hundred eight patients were positive for HMPV (3.75%). 89 (28.9%) were detected as single infection. In co-infection cases, the most common co-infecting viruses were influenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus. HMPV detection rates in the different age groups varied significantly with the children under 5 years group accounting for 71.7% of positive patients. The temporal distribution pattern for HMPV infection showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher activity during the rainy period (July\u2013September). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HMPV specimens circulating in Senegal were distributed into the two main genetic lineages, A and B. We also noted a co-circulation of both genetic lineages during the whole study period except in 2014. CONCLUSION: In summary, the present study characterized the recent prevalence, seasonality and genetic diversity of HMPV in a large outpatient population presented with ILI in Senegal between 2012 and 2016. Globally our results show a clear seasonal circulation pattern of HMPV in Senegal. Our findings identified children less than 5 years as more susceptible group to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jallow, Mamadou Malado; Fall, Amary; Kiori, Davy; Sy, Sara; Goudiaby, D\u00E9borah; Barry, Mamadou Aliou; Fall, Malick; Niang, Mbayame Ndiaye; Dia, Ndongo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c557ab38b5b3e50ba978226804a3f8c77cb64d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532257.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117983/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4096-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","ILI"],"locations":["Senegal"],"keyphrases":["HMPV infection","HMPV specimens","genetic diversity of HMPV","HMPV detection rates","molecular characteristics of HMPV","children","hMPV F gene","clear seasonal circulation pattern of HMPV","Senegal","co-infection cases","single infection","study period","retrospective study","ILI","co-circulation","present study","positive patients","clear seasonal pattern","years group accounting","retrospective pilot study","causal agent of acute respiratory infection","main genetic lineages","RESULTS","common co-infecting viruses","viral respiratory pathogens detection","temporal distribution pattern","RV16 Detection kit","common symptom","Molecular studies","susceptible group","rainy period","reactive airway disease","processing of nasopharyngeal swabs","Naso-oropharyngeal swabs","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","pneumonia","bronchiolitis","B1","influenza","asthma exacerbations","recent prevalence","higher activity","seasonality","large outpatient population","different age groups","B2","croup","adenovirus","focus","Anyplex","healthcare sentinel sites","surveillance enrollment","bronchitis","A2","diseases","epidemiology","Human metapneumovirus","outpatients","major genotypes","rhinovirus","eligible participants","cough","summary","BACKGROUND","Phylogenetic analyses","fragment","sequencing","total","rhinitis","CONCLUSION","Fever","criteria","clinical level","METHODS","findings","Half"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years.

Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahne, W.","journal":"Annual Review of Fish Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fd3a230c3b8aeb13f2e1c5ea6b82dc19573633a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0959803094900361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288350/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0959803094900361; https://doi.org/10.1016/0959-8030(94)90036-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections of aquatic animals","certain viral diseases of teleost fish","important farmed fish","Viral infections of cultivated shellfish","knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates","fish farms","farmed molluscs","number of communicable diseases of animals","expansion of aquaculture","agents","penaeid shrimp","important limiting factors","great number of viruses","epizootics","heavy losses","crustaceans","pathogenicity","outbreaks","Therfore","studies","Asian regions","reo","finfish","rhabdovirus","epizootiology","contrast","Herpes","irido","past","years","Baculoviruses","prawns"],"language":"en"},

The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in Brazil and French Polynesia have been linked to a considerable increase in the incidence of fetal microcephaly and other diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine, the early exploitation of a method to prevent expansion of ZIKV is a high priority. To validate commonly used antiviral drugs, we evaluated the effect of ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C with interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2), on ZIKV replication. In mammalian cells, we observed an inhibitory effect of ribavirin on ZIKV replication and ZIKV-induced cell death without cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we found that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were highly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome. Ribavirin abrogated viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT-1-deficient mice. These data suggest that the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be effective for treatment of ZIKV infection.

Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation. CONCLUSION: Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieuwoudt, I.; Goussard, P.; Verster, J.; Dempers, J.","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faac6cddc8f0126d5f93e948689eead41f54ad1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6970282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31959132/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-1927-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["palatine tonsils","enlarged tonsils","cases of sudden death","Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy","associated tonsillar hypertrophy","asphyxial death","cases of tonsillitis","inflamed tonsils","acute tonsillitis","Unexplained Death","epiglottis","case of sudden","bacterial tonsillitis","laryngo-pharynx","upper airway","proximal laryngeal edema","proximal laryngeal mucosa","thorough examination","Histological examination","lower airway obstruction","enlarged structures","asphyxial unexpected deaths","importance of careful examination","common feature","signs of upper","CASE PRESENTATION","common disease of childhood","evidence of acute inflammation","haemorrhage","significant role","infants","red-purple discoloration","prominent lymphoid hyperplasia","superior aspect","larynx","retropharyngeal abscess","base","possible risk factor","aryepiglottic membrane","morning","vicinity","SUDI","collapse","Infancy","CONCLUSION","theory of mechanical impediment of breathing","early hours","Lethal complications","bed","sepsis","days","airflow","BACKGROUND","year-old female","course of oral antibiotics","caregiver","start of treatment","Autopsy","rounded shape"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To describe the clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections versus single infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized infants. Study design This is a prospective study conducted in all infants under 2 years of age admitted for acute respiratory infection (September 2000\u2013June 2003) in a secondary teaching hospital. Virological diagnosis was made by two different multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates. We describe the clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple viral infections and compare them to a group of 86 randomly selected patients infected only with RSV. Results 749 specimens taken were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 65.9% of the samples. 86 children had multiple viral infections (17.4% of all positive specimens). The most frequent clinical diagnosis in this group was recurrent wheezing in 44% and bronchiolitis in 52%. Fever was significantly more frequent (p \u003C0.001), hospital stays were longer (p =0.05), and antibiotic treatment was used more (p =0.03) in infants with multiple viral infections than in the RSV-infected group. Conclusions Multiple viral infections are frequent in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease (17.4%). Multiple viral infections are linked to higher fever, longer hospital stays and more frequent use of antibiotics than in the case of infants with single RSV infections.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvo, Cristina; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Maria Luz; Blanco, Carolina; V\u00E1zquez, M\u00AA Carmen; Fr\u00EDas, M\u00AA Elena; P\u00E9rez-Bre\u00F1a, Pilar; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b30f664e1392c4ab5e914ea75a8e57722a4e0641.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108242.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320800108X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665320800108X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18455958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","Conclusions Multiple viral infections","clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections","single RSV infections","respiratory specimens of children","Respiratory viruses","frequent clinical diagnosis","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory infection","hospitalized infants","RSV-infected group","respiratory tract disease","hospitalized children","case of infants","clinical significance","longer hospital","hospital stays","single infection","frequent use of antibiotics","positive specimens","secondary teaching hospital","type of virus","higher fever","prospective study","selected patients","Study design","Virological diagnosis","different multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","assays","recurrent wheezing","years of age","presence","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Abstract Background","antibiotic treatment","bronchiolitis","Objectives","Results","samples"],"language":"en"},

Until today \u003E2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for \u003E8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Materials and methods In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease. Significance The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elfiky, Abdo A.","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbd0883af84e01bf3f6c874e9cb863934995a113.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117477; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520302253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32119961/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520302253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","MERS HCoV","Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["anti-polymerase drugs","Wuhan COVID","emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model","potent drugs","anti-HCV drugs","emerged HCoV disease","approved drugs Sofosbuvir","SARS HCoV","MERS HCoV","deaths","China","confirmed cases","reported cases","emerged Human Coronavirus","present study","current study","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","perfect model","Ribavirin","emerged viral infection","human transmission","effectiveness of Sofosbuvir","reports","testing","sequence analysis","silico","results","docking","methods","modeling","efficiency","World Health Organization","Key findings","Significance","IDX","Remidisvir","Abstract","months","Materials","countries"],"language":"en"},

A wide range of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, rhinovirus (HRV), have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children in the past decades. However, in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies, newly discovered viruses have been identified including human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses NL63 (HcoV-NL63) and HKU1 (HcoV-HKU1), human Bocavirus (HBoV), new enterovirus (HEV), parechovirus (HpeV) and rhinovirus (HRV) strains, polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) and the pandemic H1N1v influenza A virus. These discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns. In this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging.

We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on mortality in adult patients with influenza pneumonia by comparing corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Science databases were searched for all controlled studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids and placebo in adult patients with influenza pneumonia. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), and the rate of secondary infection. RESULTS: Ten trials involving 6548 patients were pooled in our final analysis. Significant heterogeneity was found in all outcome measures except for ICU LOS (I(2) = 38%, P = 0.21). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 ~ 2.36, Z = 3.71, P = 0.0002), longer ICU LOS (mean difference [MD] 2.14, 95% CI 1.17 ~ 3.10, Z = 4.35, P \u003C 0.0001), and a higher rate of secondary infection (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 ~ 3.78, Z = 2.08, P = 0.04) but not MV days (MD 0.81, 95% CI \u2212 1.23 ~ 2.84, Z = 0.78, P = 0.44) in patients with influenza pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with influenza pneumonia, corticosteroid use is associated with higher mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018112384).

In the UK, the NHS Direct telephone service was used by many of these patients. We used qualitative interviews to identify the main reasons why people approached NHS Direct with concerns about swine flu and to identify aspects of their contact which were reassuring, using a framework approach. METHODS: 33 patients participated in semi-structured interviews. All patients had telephoned NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May with concerns about swine flu and had been assessed as being unlikely to have the illness. RESULTS: Reasons for seeking advice about swine flu included: the presence of unexpectedly severe flu-like symptoms; uncertainties about how one can catch swine flu; concern about giving it to others; pressure from friends or employers; and seeking \u0027peace of mind.\u0027 Most participants found speaking to NHS Direct reassuring or useful. Helpful aspects included: having swine flu ruled out; receiving an alternative explanation for symptoms; clarification on how swine flu is transmitted; and the perceived credibility of NHS Direct. No-one reported anything that had increased their anxiety and only one participant subsequently sought additional advice about swine flu from elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Future major incidents involving other forms of chemical, biological or radiological hazards may also cause large numbers of unexposed people to seek health advice. Our data suggest that providing telephone triage and information is helpful in such instances, particularly where advice can be given via a trusted, pre-existing service.","publish_time":"2010-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubin, G James; Aml\u00F4t, Richard; Carter, Holly; Large, Shirley; Wessely, Simon; Page, Lisa","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fc8c1b4cfbd790cbe02c825fd6f9181b1fc6645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2919480.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20678192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHS Direct"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine flu","severe flu","NHS Direct reassuring","telephoned NHS Direct","NHS Direct telephone service","perceived credibility of NHS Direct","health advice","additional advice","large majority of patients","symptoms","concerns","Helpful aspects","illness","main reasons","large numbers of unexposed people","telephone triage","health services","qualitative interviews","pre-existing service","semi-structured interviews","outbreak","forms of chemical","radiological hazards","influenza H1N1","clarification","Future major incidents","information","early stages","uncertainties","UK","presence","alternative explanation","employers","CONCLUSIONS","instances","participants","pressure","friends","BACKGROUND","data","METHODS","RESULTS","peace of mind","framework approach","anxiety","contact"],"language":"en"},

It is not clear how the heterologous viruses interact within the respiratory tract of the infected host to lengthen the duration of what are usually short, self-limiting infections. We develop a mathematical model which allows for single cells to be infected simultaneously with two different respiratory viruses (superinfection) to investigate the possibility of chronic coinfections. We find that a model with superinfection and cell regeneration has a stable chronic coinfection fixed point, while superinfection without cell regeneration produces only acute infections. This analysis suggests that both superinfection and cell regeneration are required to sustain chronic coinfection via this mechanism since coinfection is maintained by superinfected cells that allow slow-growing infections a chance to infect cells and continue replicating. This model provides a possible mechanism for chronic coinfection independent of any viral interactions via the immune response.","publish_time":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinky, Lubna; Gonz\u00E1lez-Parra, Gilberto; Dobrovolny, Hana M.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d67827b8f22cb3933131a4685d4ac9c0f7f46929.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639572/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.01.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319300116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319300116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["superinfection","chronic coinfection independent","cell regeneration","acute infections","long-lasting infections","self-limiting infections","stable chronic coinfection fixed point","possibility of chronic coinfections","superinfected cells","slow-growing infections","single cells","mathematical model","infected host","different respiratory viruses","viral interactions","possible mechanism","respiratory tract","heterologous viruses","viral pathogen","chance","Abstract Molecular diagnostic techniques","immune response","duration","patients","influenza","illness","analysis"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: National surveillance studies, 2008-17. SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: China\u2019s success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Yanhui; Wang, Liping; Burgner, David P; Miller, Jessica E; Song, Yi; Ren, Xiang; Li, Zhongjie; Xing, Yi; Ma, Jun; Sawyer, Susan M; Patton, George C","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2310f7d4f82dcf7fd5301033d0b4a2b47d0f3f17.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ecab4066f05bc2f07ac5618ce1cf892993f8fa17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241761/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["unpredictable diseases","Vectorborne diseases","transmitted diseases","incidence of notifiable infectious diseases","persisting diseases","enterovirus diseases","incidence of vaccine preventable diseases","infectious disease control","children","adolescents","AIDS","incidence of gastrointestinal","deaths","low incidence","seasonal influenza","pre-covid","escalation of HIV","western China","era","tuberculosis","mainland China","diagnosis","Zoonotic infections","PARTICIPANTS","bloodborne infections","years","females","mumps","Quarantinable conditions","unpredictable outbreaks","high mortality","noticeable reduction","common bacterial infection","enteroviral","rabies","renewed efforts","sex","variations","age","recent trends","China\u2019s success","effective response","disproportionate burden","leading causes of death","scaling","vaccination","cases of scarlet fever","prevention","CONCLUSIONS","regions","groups","regional inequalities","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","DESIGN","National surveillance studies","novel SARS-CoV","paratyphoid","SETTING","provinces","Chinese students","challenges","dysentery","malaria","Difference","H1N1","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","population"],"language":"en"},

JAK2 inhibition either by CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) or by silencing JAK2-expression revealed a dominant JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation pathway for NF-\u03BAB activation and resulted in NF-\u03BAB inhibition, which overrode the I\u03BAB\u03B1 regulation via the IKK-2. Finally, tylophorine-based compounds work cooperatively with CYT387 to impart comprehensive anti-TGEV activities.

This study investigates the mechanisms of SARS-CoV PLpro-induced TGF-\u03B21 promoter activation in human lung epithelial cells and mouse models. SARS-CoV PLpro dose- and time-dependently up-regulates TGF-\u03B21 and vimentin in A549 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays with TGF-\u03B21 promoter plasmids indicated that TGF-\u03B21 promoter region between \u2212175 to \u221260, the Egr-1 binding site, was responsible for TGF-\u03B21 promoter activation induced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Subcellular localization analysis of transcription factors showed PLpro triggering nuclear translocation of Egr-1, but not NF-\u03BAB and Sp-1. Meanwhile, Egr-1 silencing by siRNA significantly reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-\u03B21, TSP-1 and pro-fibrotic genes. Furthermore, the inhibitors for ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and STAT3 (Stattic) revealed ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway involving in Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-\u03B21 promoter induced by PLpro. In a mouse model with a direct pulmonary injection, PLpro stimulated macrophage infiltration into lung, up-regulating Egr-1, TSP-1, TGF-\u03B21 and vimentin expression in lung tissues. The results revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro significantly triggered Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-\u03B21 promoter via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway, correlating with up-regulation of pro-fibrotic responses in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shih-Wein; Wang, Ching-Ying; Jou, Yu-Jen; Yang, Tsuey-Ching; Huang, Su-Hua; Wan, Lei; Lin, Ying-Ju; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/222534164391422210b3089109605e8ff4d1d46c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4865725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173006/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25754","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV PLpro-induced TGF-\u03B21 promoter activation","TGF-\u03B21 promoter plasmids","TGF-\u03B21 promoter region","regulation of TGF","dependent activation of TGF","SARS-CoV PLpro dose","reduced PLpro","SARS coronavirus","mechanisms of SARS","triggered Egr","ROS","PLpro stimulated macrophage infiltration","p38 MAPK","nuclear translocation of Egr","STAT3 pathway","human lung epithelial cells","lung tissues","TSP","regulation of pro-fibrotic responses","pro-fibrotic genes","human promonocytes","mouse models","A549 cells","vimentin expression","direct pulmonary injection","Subcellular localization analysis of transcription factors","Dual luciferase reporter assays","YCG063","SB203580","Stattic","papain","silencing","siRNA","binding site","time","Proteomics","protease","results","NF-\u03BAB","inhibitors","study"],"language":"en"},

It is positioned at the 5\u2032 side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from which it is separated by an intergenic stretch of 12 bases. The deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has a net charge of \u002B7 at neutral pH. Thirty-four percent of its amino acid sequence is homologous with the M protein of the bovine coronavirus (BCV), 32% with that of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), and 19% with that of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Judging from alignment with the BCV, MHV, and IBV M proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for BCV, 26 for MHV, and 21 for IBV. Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. When mRNA from infected cells, or RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of the reconstructed M gene, was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the M protein became translocated and glycosylated. When a protein without the amino-terminal signal peptide was made by translating a truncated version of the M gene transcript, some translocation and glycosylation also occurred suggesting that the amino-terminal signal peptide on the TGEV M protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation. Interestingly, the amino-terminal peptide did not appear to be cleaved during in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes suggesting that a step in virion assembly may be required for proper exposure of the cleavage site to the signal peptidase.","publish_time":"1988-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapke, Paul A.; Tung, Frank Y.T.; Hogue, Brenda G.; Brian, David A.; Woods, Roger D.; Wesley, Ronald","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf78f453e4f454f92454f388f5167542c4825f33.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288905818; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288905818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gilbert"],"organizations":["IBV M","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amino-terminal amino acids","amino-terminal peptide","amino terminus","amino-terminal signal peptide","amino acid sequence","MHV","IBV","TGEV","cleavable signal peptide","proteins of BCV","signal peptidase","bovine coronavirus","mouse hepatitis coronavirus","gene transcript","membrane translocation","presence of microsomes","bases","similar sequence","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus","virion assembly","membrane insertion","virion envelope","open reading frame","Gilbert","cleavage site","end","genome","positions","proper exposure","absolute requirement","properties","step","matrix","glycosylation","method of Maxam","Abstract cDNA clones mapping","net charge","truncated version","molecular weight","mRNA","infected cells","transcription","percent","neutral pH","intergenic stretch","nucleocapsid","translation","E1","alignment"],"language":"en"},

Adamantane resistance is associated with a single amino acid change (S31N) in the M2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza A/H3N2 viruses carrying the S31N mutation has not been characterized, particularly in South-East Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997-2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere (New York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere (New Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in South-East Asia (Hong Kong, 281 isolates). We find that although the S31N mutation was independently introduced at least 11 times, the vast majority of resistant viruses now circulating globally descend from a single introduction that was first detected in the summer of 2003 in Hong Kong. These resistant viruses were continually detected in Hong Kong throughout 2003-2005, acquired a novel HA through reassortment during the first part of 2005, and thereafter spread globally. The emergence and persistence of adamantane-resistant viruses in Hong Kong further supports a source-sink model of global influenza virus ecology, in which South-East Asia experiences continuous viral activity and repeatedly seeds epidemics in temperate areas.","publish_time":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Martha I.; Simonsen, Lone; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Miller, Mark A.; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/664cf3e09117557e5b84a549e72d800559d9cca6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/119506a216bda7e3d126e1158953dd36694ae7f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2705899.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209002013; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2705899?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19394063/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209002013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","New Zealand","Australia","Hong Kong","South-East Asia"],"keyphrases":["Hong Kong","H3N2 viruses","H3N2 influenza viruses","vast majority of resistant viruses","Adamantane resistance","S31N mutation","segments of viral isolates","United States","persistence of adamantane","South-East Asia experiences continuous viral activity","exact origin of influenza","Northern hemisphere","Southern hemisphere","New Zealand","adamantane class of antiviral drugs","temperate localities","temperate areas","novel HA","single introduction","model of global influenza virus ecology","New York State","genome reassortment event","single amino acid change","subtropical locality","epidemics","M1","Australia","source","multiple Asian countries","times","association","phylogenetic analysis","emergence","M2 protein","summer"],"language":"en"},

A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F1 females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all liver fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F1 females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodacryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodacryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.","publish_time":"1990-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rommereim, D.

Because of their novelty, there are limited measures available to control their early spread. Learning from past outbreaks is important for future preparation. The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS\u2010CoV ) 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK) provides one such opportunity. OBJECTIVES: We demonstrated through quantitative methodologies how to estimate MERS\u2010CoV\u0027s transmissibility and identified the effective countermeasures that stopped its spread. METHODS: Using the outbreak data, statistical methods were employed to estimate the basic reproductive number R (0), the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case during its entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population. A transmission dynamics model was also proposed to estimate R (0) and to identify the most effective countermeasures. The consistency between results will provide cross\u2010validation of the approaches. RESULTS: R (0) ranged from 2.5 with 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.7, 3.1] (using the sequential Bayesian method) to 7.2 with 95% CI: [5.3, 9.4] (using the Nowcasting method). Estimates from transmission model were higher but overlapped with these. Personal protection and rapid confirmation of cases were identified as the most important countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates were in agreement with others from the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS\u2010CoV. The large\u2010scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare\u2010associated setting and the Korean culture\u2010associated contact behaviour. Limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and isolating cases and avoiding high\u2010risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission.","publish_time":"2017-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xu\u2010Sheng; Pebody, Richard; Charlett, Andre; de Angelis, Daniela; Birrell, Paul; Kang, Hunseok; Baguelin, Marc; Choi, Yoon Hong","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e523533cb5df819c3354420da60b7c82f9f92485.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5598245.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28703921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROK"],"locations":["Middle Eastern","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["ROK outbreak","Estimates","sporadic cases of MERS","isolating cases","outbreak data","large\u2010scale outbreak","important countermeasures","transmission model","effective countermeasures","rapid confirmation of cases","average number of secondary cases","transmission dynamics model","results","basic reproductive number R","associated contact behaviour","associated setting","small outbreaks","past outbreaks","CoV\u0027s transmissibility","high transmissibility","early spread","statistical methods","Nowcasting method","Emerging respiratory infections","sequential Bayesian method","Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus","Korean culture","entire infectious period","typical primary case","significant public health threat","healthcare","limited measures available","Personal protection","future preparation","high\u2010risk contacts","agreement","susceptible population","quantitative methodologies","Republic of Korea","novelty","validation","BACKGROUND","Learning","approaches","OBJECTIVES","confidence interval","consistency","CONCLUSIONS","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Hupin, David; Celarier, Thomas; Bongue, Bienvenu","journal":"JMIR Aging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5380d8fefd3dbc9cafcd0e933cbd76161a6530d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207013.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group physical activity programs","charge of physical activity programs","mental health of older adults","young adults","mental health state of older adults","group physical activities","home","French Federation of Physical Education","need","period of quarantine","quarantine period","quarantine measures","end of quarantine","sedentary lifestyle","OBJECTIVE","level of independence","FFPEVG","impact","loss of independence","COVID","study territories","RESULTS","risk of death","higher risk of coronavirus disease","semistructured interviews","thematic analysis","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","professionals","Voluntary Gymnastics","managers","sports trainers","number of seniors","pre-existing medical conditions","qualitative survey","children","safe ways","SARS CoV","decline","participation","appropriate campaign","alternatives","national policy","mobility","old age","epidemic","well-being","reasons","common interview guide","limited space","METHODS","context","issue","population","BACKGROUND","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We performed a retrospective study of children presenting with acute respiratory infections comparing clinical severity of single respiratory virus infection to virus coinfection, detected on midturbinate swabs by molecular assays. Patient characteristics and measures of clinical severity were abstracted from health records. A total of 472 virus-infected children were included, 391 with a single virus infection and 81 with virus coinfection. Virus status did not affect admission to hospital (odds ratio (OR) = 0.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.5\u20131.4; p 0.491) or clinical disease severity among inpatients (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.5\u20131.5; p 0.515) after adjusting for age and underlying comorbidities. However, children infected with rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/ENT) alone were more likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to those coinfected with HRV/ENT and at least another virus, although this was not significant in multivariable analyses (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22\u20131.0; p 0.051). In multivariable analyses, children coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses were significantly more likely to present with radiologically confirmed pneumonia compared to those with an isolated RSV infection (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.07\u20139.34, p 0.037). Equivalent clinical severity was observed between children with single virus infection and virus coinfection, although children coinfected with RSV and other viruses presented more frequently with pneumonia than those with single RSV infection.

This is resulting in a growing demand for alternative approaches to designing and evaluating interventions in complex systems. Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach which may be useful because it enables stakeholders to present and test their theories and assumptions about why and how impact may occur, ideally within an environment conducive to iterative reflection and learning. However, ToC is yet to be appropriately mainstreamed into development by donors, researchers and practitioners. We carried out a literature review, triangulated by interviews with 26 experts in African and Asian food security, consisting of researchers, advisors to programs, and donors. Although 17 (65%) of the experts had adopted ToC, their responses and the literature revealed four challenges to mainstreaming: (i) different interpretations of ToC; (ii) incoherence in relationships among the constituent concepts of ToC; (iii) confused relationships between ToC and project \u201Clogframes\u201D; and (iv) limitations in necessary skills and commitment for enacting ToC. A case study of the evolution of a ToC in a West African AR4D project over 4 years which exemplified these challenges is presented. Five recommendations arise to assist the mainstreaming of ToC: (i) select a type of ToC suited to the relative complexity of the problem and focal system of interest; (ii) state a theory or hypotheses to be tested as the intervention progresses; (iii) articulate the relationship between the ToC and parallel approaches (e.g. logframe); (iv) accept that a ToC is a process, and (v) allow time and resources for implementers and researchers to develop ToC thinking within projects. Finally, we suggest that communities of practice should be established among AR4D and donor organisations to test, evaluate and improve the contribution that ToCs can make to sustainable food security and agricultural development.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maru, Yiheyis Taddele; Sparrow, Ashley; Butler, James R.A.; Banerjee, Onil; Ison, Ray; Hall, Andy; Carberry, Peter","journal":"Agricultural Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37690abc411192607d8e7a2ee414ec16c4002c9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287945/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308521X17310053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310053; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["mainstreaming of ToC","enacting ToC","type of ToC","constituent concepts of ToC","different interpretations of ToC","researchers","agricultural development","sustainable food security","Asian food security","West African AR4D project","relationships","interventions","experts","donors","challenges","Abstract Food insecurity","alternative approaches","parallel approaches","literature review","Theory of Change","ongoing agricultural research","parts of Africa","relative complexity","necessary skills","commitment","years","environment conducive","iterative reflection","learning","problem","ToCs","evolution","interviews","advisors","incoherence","implementers","responses","focal system","limitations","growing demand","time","resources","programs","practitioners","logframes","case study","assumptions","theories","stakeholders","contribution","hypotheses","complex systems","donor organisations","projects","intervention progresses","communities of practice","impact","recommendations","process"],"language":"en"},

The elimination of pulmonary SARS-CoV infection required the activation of B cells by CD4\u002B T cells. Furthermore, passive immunization (post-infection) with homologous (murine) anti-SARS-CoV antiserum showed greater elimination efficacy against SARS-CoV than that with heterologous (rabbit) antiserum, despite the use of equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies. This distinction was mediated by mouse phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils), as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by immunological depletion of selected cell types.

It reports perceptions of drinking and smoking from a three-phased study of the stigma associated with TB, consisting of a qualitative pilot study using focus-group discussions (2006), a larger-scale community survey (2007), and follow-up group discussions (2009). The community attitude survey was conducted with a sample of 1,020 adults living in a low-income township in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study found that the moral and the biomedical understanding of TB risk are intertwined. In the community survey, perceptions of drinking and smoking as TB risk were predicted by fear of contracting TB and being a self-reported born-again Christian. In the follow-up study, heavy drinking and smoking in shebeens (unlicensed township liquor outlets) was associated with a risky lifestyle that can spread both TB and HIV.

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the \u03B2-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Tamina; Lee, Sang-Yeop; Kim, Seil; Kim, Mi Jeong; Kim, Hong Gi; Jun, Sangmi; Kim, Seung Il; Kim, Bum Tae; Park, Edmond Changkyun; Park, Daeui","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fd481350d3f54da10a201a48dae0e14e0095ee7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eb7fc5004191e8fce0d6e4ff98de6865872e665f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.951178","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV S protein","MERS-CoV S protein","btSARS-CoV","viral S protein","SARS-CoV related bat viruses","neutralizing antibody","sequence analysis of S protein","effective neutralizing antibodies","Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies","binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies","D12 mouse antibodies","therapeutic antibody","human ACE2 receptor","Coronavirus disease","antibody-antigen docking simulation","viral capsid","viral invaders","China","cases of COVID","higher binding affinity","new emerging human infectious disease","host receptor","RBD region","high affinity","common linear epitope region","effective drugs","development of antigen diagnosis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","residues","major differences","conformational epitopes","Wuhan seafood","manner","cellular entry of virus","crucial clues","best efforts","\u03B2-sheet structure","genome","uncoating","animal market","specific defense","vaccine","interaction","Sipke","bioinformatic methods","insertion regions","findings","F26G19","CR3022","researchers","nCoV","result","counties","study"],"language":"en"},

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biosensors (genosensors) have been exploited for their inherent physico-chemical stability and suitability to discriminate different organism strains. The main principle of detection among genosensors relies on specific DNA hybridization, directly on the surface of a physical transducer. This review covers the main DNA immobilization techniques reported so far, new micro- and nanotechnological platforms for biosensing and the transduction mechanisms in genosensors. Clinical applications, in particular, demand large-scale and decentralized DNA testing. New schemes for DNA diagnosis include DNA chips and microfluidics, which couples DNA detection with sample pretreatment under in vivo-like hybridization conditions. Higher sensitivity and specificity may arise from nanoengineered structures, like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and DNA/protein conjugates. A new platform for universal DNA biosensing is also presented, and its implications for the future of molecular diagnosis are argued.","publish_time":"2008-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teles, F.R.R.; Fonseca, L.

Notably, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and motivation in vaccinating against influenza among older adults in Singapore.

Many studies have described the frequency of viruses in hospitalized patients, but studies describing the prevalence of viruses in the community setting are limited, particularly in developing countries, where most of the deaths from serious respiratory diseases occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity of respiratory viruses in the community setting using molecular diagnostic tools, as well as the clinical characteristics of respiratory viral infections in the general pediatric practice in Mexico. METHODS: Children with respiratory tract infections attending private pediatric practices during a 10-month period in five cities of the state of Veracruz were included. Nasal swabs were taken and processed by a multiplex detection kit for 15 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: 525 children were included from July 2011 to May 2012; 44% were female, mean age was 45 months. The 3 most frequent clinical diagnosis were: rhinopharyngitis 68%, pharyngitis 18%, and 3.3% influenza-like illness. 71.5% of the samples were positive for virus. The five most frequent pathogens were respiratory syncycitial virus in 18.3% of the children, rhinovirus in 17.5%, influenza A 9.1%, adenovirus 7.2%, and enterovirus 3.4%, although all 15 viruses were detected; there were viral coinfections in 14.1%, and 28.5% of the samples were negative. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of respiratory infections in the community setting in Mexico was associated to viruses. Although testing for common respiratory pathogens in children with acute respiratory tract infections may lead to a better understanding of the role of viral pathogens in, and eventually to improvement in the management of, individual patients, additional prospective studies are required to study the need of routinely using such tests in general pediatric practices in resource-limited countries.","publish_time":"2015-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong-Chew, Rosa M; Espinoza, Marco A; Taboada, Blanca; Aponte, Fernando E; Arias-Ortiz, Mar\u00EDa A; Monge-Mart\u00EDnez, Jes\u00FAs; Rodr\u00EDguez-V\u00E1zquez, Rub\u00E9n; D\u00EDaz-Hern\u00E1ndez, Fidel; Z\u00E1rate-Vidal, Fernando; Santos-Preciado, Jos\u00E9 I; L\u00F3pez, Susana; Arias, Carlos F","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/933e9eb0d544bb5afe34f6d6049b4c8bc5e96d19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4479372.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-015-1239-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico","Veracruz"],"keyphrases":["diversity of respiratory viruses","Acute respiratory tract infections","children","common respiratory pathogens","respiratory syncycitial virus","large proportion of respiratory infections","clinical characteristics of respiratory viral infections","serious respiratory diseases","prevalence of viruses","frequency of viruses","community setting","frequent pathogens","general pediatric practices","role of viral pathogens","private pediatric practices","viral coinfections","Mexico","influenza","samples","study","additional prospective studies","frequent clinical diagnosis","resource-limited countries","individual patients","hospitalized patients","developing countries","leading cause of morbidity","tests","better understanding","molecular diagnostic tools","cities","management","month period","rhinopharyngitis","mortality","deaths","multiplex detection kit","testing","BACKGROUND","METHODS","female","mean age","months","improvement","CONCLUSIONS","state of Veracruz","adenovirus","need","rhinovirus","Nasal swabs","enterovirus","aim","illness","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Purpose.\u2013 Molecular processes can have a different impact on epidemiological data. Patients and methods. \u2013 The study covers 118 nasal aspirate samples taken on children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation for 2 years. Conventional techniques associated viral culture and immunofluorescence while molecular techniques used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. \u2013 Virus presence was revealed with conventional techniques in 34% of the respiratory samples (40/118), while PCR study of viruses and genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae allowed positive identification in 68% of the samples (80/118). The combination of both techniques allowed identification of an infectious agent in 77% of cases (91/118). More than one pathogenic agent was isolated in 23% of positive samples. Epidemiological study shows prevalence of rhinovirus (45%), then respiratory syncytial virus (28%) and enterovirus (8.5%). In children under 2 years of age, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus have a close prevalence (respectively 42 and 36%), which is not the same result as in older children (respectively 66 and 27%). Moreover, PCR techniques allowed the identification of just a few Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6/118). Conclusion. \u2013 In this study, molecular techniques of identification demonstrate a clear advantage in sensitivity compared to performances of viral cultures or immunofluorescence. The importance of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus is remarkable while Chlamydia pneumoniae an Mycoplasma pneumoniae do not seem to be particularly involved.","publish_time":"2001-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, J; Freymuth, F; Toutain, F; Vabret, A; Petitjean, J; Gouarin, S; Guillois, B; Duhamel, J.

Although certain synthetic dsRNA molecules have been identified to show immunostimulation in mammalian cells, very little is known about the ability of these sequences to stimulate avian cells. The current study investigated immunostimulatory properties of four synthetic oligonucleotide sequences using chicken splenocytes. Expression of TLR3 and 7, type I interferons and several other cytokines as well as TLR signaling pathway-related genes at different time points post-stimulation was quantified by real-time PCR. A dose-dependent increase in expression of TLR3 was observed in splenocytes treated with poly-UGUGU (poly-UG) and \u03B2-galactosidase dsRNA molecules. TLR3 and TLR7 gene expression was significantly up-regulated upon stimulation with all four dsRNA molecules. Furthermore, in a time course study, a significant increase was noted in the expression of TLR3, TLR7, interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6 as well as 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS in splenocytes treated with poly-UG.

Influenza surveillance has been conducted in Zambia since 2008; however, only 4.3% of patients enrolled in 2011\u20132012 were positive for influenza. Therefore, we examined non-influenza respiratory pathogens in children with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Zambia, to estimate the scope of disease burden and determine commonly-identified respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods (single and multiplex) were used to analyze nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected from SARI cases under five years of age from January 2011 through December 2012. All specimens were negative for influenza by rRT-PCR. The panel of singleplex reactions targeted seven viruses, while the multiplex assay targeted thirty-three bacteria, fungi, and viruses. RESULTS: A set of 297 specimens were tested by singleplex rRT-PCR, and a different set of 199 were tested by multiplex rRT-PCR. Using the singleplex assay, 184/297 (61.9%) specimens were positive for one or more viruses. The most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (57/297; 19.2%), human adenovirus (50/297; 16.8%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (45/297; 15.2%). Using multiplex PCR, at least one virus was detected from 167/199 (83.9%) specimens, and at least one bacteria was detected from 197/199 (99.0%) specimens. Cytomegalovirus (415/199; 208.5%) and RSV (67/199; 33.7%) were the most commonly detected viruses, while Streptococcus pneumonie (109/199; 54.8%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (92/199; 46.2%) were the most commonly detected bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Single infections and co-infections of many viruses and bacteria were identified in children with SARI. These results provide an estimate of the prevalence of infection and show which respiratory pathogens are commonly identified in patients. Further studies should investigate causal associations between individual pathogens and SARI.","publish_time":"2015-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simusika, Paul; Bateman, Allen C; Theo, Andros; Kwenda, Geoffrey; Mfula, Christine; Chentulo, Edward; Monze, Mwaka","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aed6af6e457e60fbbfa1813be7e7ac2ea6b5fed1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4391483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888024/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0779-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["SARI","RSV"],"locations":["Zambia"],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","specimens","multiplex PCR","acute respiratory infections","multiplex rRT-PCR","non-influenza respiratory pathogens","singleplex rRT-PCR","detected bacteria","prevalent viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","Single infections","individual pathogens","multiplex assay","patients","severe acute respiratory illness","co-infections","SARI cases","limited studies","Influenza surveillance","singleplex assay","resource-limited countries","children","resource-limited settings","METHODS","Zambia","RESULTS","estimate","RSV","panel of singleplex reactions","different set","human rhinovirus","human adenovirus","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","mortality","causal associations","throat swabs","Morbidity","CONCLUSIONS","prevalence of infection","fungi","years of age","BACKGROUND","Streptococcus pneumonie","scope of disease burden","Moraxella catarrhalis","Cytomegalovirus"],"language":"en"},

Variation in the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection. To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption. Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication. Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant. Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike. These findings demonstrate that MERS-CoV spike can utilize multiple paths to rapidly adapt to novel species variation in DPP4.","publish_time":"2018-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Letko, Michael; Miazgowicz, Kerri; McMinn, Rebekah; Seifert, Stephanie N.; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Carmody, Aaron; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Munster, Vincent","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29b7afed48136a3de4542fc5f88328a8fc255438.json; document_parses/pdf_json/67df1a54718bd0a96b8368e264011107713b008b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104223.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124718311483; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718311483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30110630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["DPP4 variant","suboptimal DPP4","viral spike","suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4","species adaptability of MERS","MERS-CoV spike protein","species barrier","cross-species adaptation","novel species variation","viral entry","viral adaption","distinct paths of viral adaptation","surface charge of spike","accumulation of mutations","multiple paths","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","genetic mechanisms","functional assays","host receptor","dipeptidyl peptidase","Parallel passages","dromedary camels","interaction","humans","Structural analysis","bats","cells","findings","infection","replication"],"language":"en"},

Commercially, both live and killed PRRSV vaccines are available to control PRRS, but they are not always successful. Based on the results of mucosal immunization studies in other viral models, a good mucosal vaccine may be an effective way to elicit protective immunity to control PRRS outbreaks. In the present study, mucosal adjuvanticity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was evaluated in pigs administered a modified live PRRS virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) intranasally. A Mtb WCL mediated increase in the frequency of NK cells, CD8\u002Band CD4\u002B T cells, and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells in pig lungs were detected. Importantly, an increased and early generation of PRRSV specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in PRRS-MLV\u002B Mtb WCL compared to pigs inoculated with vaccine alone. In addition, there was an increased secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN\u03B3 and IL-12) that correlated with a reciprocal reduction in the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF\u03B2) as well as T-regulatory cells in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV\u002B Mtb WCL. Further, a complete rescue in arginase levels in the lungs mediated through Mtb WCL was observed in pigs inoculated with PRRS-MLV. In conclusion, Mtb WCL may be a potent mucosal adjuvant for PRRS-MLV in order to potentiate the anti-PRRSV specific immune responses to control PRRS effectively.","publish_time":"2011-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Patterson, Ruthi; Dodson, Katie; Weeman, Matthew; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c57198864b72b283d2d00c1b4b28d3cc336e9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126640.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11003574; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11003574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21419164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.03.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","PRRSV","Mtb WCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRS-MLV","PRRS outbreaks","pigs","Mtb WCL mediated increase","modified live PRRS virus vaccine","\u03B3\u03B4 T cells","good mucosal vaccine","T-regulatory cells","potent mucosal adjuvant","frequency of NK cells","PRRSV vaccines","IL","mucosal adjuvanticity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","results of mucosal immunization studies","anti-PRRSV specific immune responses","early generation of PRRSV specific neutralizing antibodies","increased secretion of Th1 cytokines","pig lungs","production of immunosuppressive cytokines","viral models","cell lysate","CD8","CD4","order","effective way","respiratory syndrome","protective immunity","IFN\u03B3","present study","arginase levels","important disease","complete rescue","reciprocal reduction","pork producers","TGF\u03B2","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS-CoV infection was compared with those testing negative MERS-CoV PCR. Health care workers (HCW) with MERS were compared with MERS patients who were not health care workers. One hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Forty eight tested positive for MERS CoV, 44 (92%) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were HCW. There were 111 MERS-CoV negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as \u201Cnegative controls\u201D. Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients. A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated. Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness. Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome. Health care workers with MERS had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non HCW MERS patients.","publish_time":"2016-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garbati, Musa A.; Fagbo, Shamsudeen F.; Fang, Vicky J.; Skakni, Leila; Joseph, Mercy; Wani, Tariq A.; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Peiris, Malik; Hakawi, Ahmed","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/befd47f9dd7e050dcd46f483ca8e7bd902f4707f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5094725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27812197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Fahad Medical City","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS CoV","MERS-CoV negative patients","HCW MERS patients","negative MERS-CoV PCR","confirmed MERS-CoV infection","negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results","clinical outcomes of patients","Health care workers","adverse outcome","better clinical outcome","negative controls","clinical features","poor outcome","acute respiratory illnesses","diabetes","acute respiratory disease","study","co-morbid illnesses","global health concern","laboratory characteristics","Middle East Respiratory syndrome","initiating laboratory tests","diarrhoea","older age","risk factors","King Fahad Medical City","KFMC","high level of suspicion","Riyadh","Variables","demographics","Saudi Arabia","hospital","infections","inclusion","objective"],"language":"en"},

We sought to investigate the variability in transmissibility of H1N1 pandemic in different health regions (including urban centres and remote, isolated communities) in the province of Manitoba, Canada. METHODS: The Richards model was used to fit to the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases and estimate transmissibility (referred to as the basic reproduction number, R(0)), doubling times, and turning points of outbreaks in both spring and fall waves of the H1N1 pandemic in several health regions. RESULTS: We observed considerable variation in R(0 )estimates ranging from 1.55 to 2.24, with confidence intervals ranging from 1.45 to 2.88, for an average generation time of 2.9 days, and shorter doubling times in some remote and isolated communities compared to urban centres, suggesting a more rapid spread of disease in these communities during the first wave. For the second wave, R(e), the effective reproduction number, is estimated to be lower for remote and isolated communities; however, outbreaks appear to have been driven by somewhat higher transmissibility in urban centres. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable geographic variation in transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic outbreaks. While highlighting the importance of estimating R(0 )for informing health responses, the findings indicate that projecting the transmissibility for large-scale epidemics may not faithfully characterize the early spread of disease in remote and isolated communities.","publish_time":"2011-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mosta\u00E7o-Guidolin, Luiz C; Greer, Amy; Sander, Beate; Wu, Jianhong; Moghadas, Seyed M","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df7ce7b791dbb8848b6222b823622cc5866f681e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3278401.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["isolated communities","transmissibility of H1N1 pandemic","pandemic outbreaks","urban centres","higher transmissibility","geographic regions","different health regions","considerable variation","health responses","considerable geographic variation","effective reproduction number","basic reproduction number","points of outbreaks","importance of estimating R","shorter doubling times","rapid spread of disease","early spread of disease","daily number of laboratory","days","spring","severity","cases","waves","province of Manitoba","average generation time","prevalence","CONCLUSIONS","findings","populations","variability","large-scale epidemics","METHODS","Richards model","BACKGROUND","Canada","RESULTS","estimates","confidence intervals"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In order to analyze clinical features and laboratory findings in infants with pertussis hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms during a seasonal RSV outbreak, we conducted a retrospective single-center study on 19 infants with pertussis (6 boys; median age 72 days) and 19 matched controls (RSV-bronchiolitis), hospitalized from October 2008 to April 2010. B. pertussis and RSV were detected from nasopharyngeal washes with Real Time-PCR. RESULTS: Infants with pertussis were less often breastfeed than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (63.2% vs 89.5%; p \u003C0.06). Clinically, significantly fewer infants with pertussis than controls had more episodes of whooping cough (63.2% vs 0.0%; p \u003C 0.001) and also less frequently fever at admission (15.8% vs 68.4%; p \u003C0.01), apnea (52.6% vs 10.5%; p \u003C0.006), and cyanosis (52.6% vs 10.5%; p \u003C 0.006). Infants with pertussis had more often no abnormal chest sounds on auscultation than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (0% vs 42,1%; p \u003C 0.005). The absolute blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were higher in infants with B. pertussis than in controls with bronchiolitis (23886 \u00B1 16945 vs 10725 \u00B1 4126 cells/mm(3), p \u003C 0.0001 and 13.653 \u00B1 10.430 vs 4.730 \u00B1 2.400 cells/mm(3), p \u003C 0.001). The molecular analysis of 2 B. pertussis isolates for ptxA1, ptxP3, and prn2 genes showed the presence of gene variants.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 60 infants who were diagnosed with bronchiolitis within 96 hr of wheezing onset upon admission and on days 3, 5, and 7 in the hospital, and 17 respiratory viruses were detected. The RSV load was quantified by real\u2010time qPCR for RSV subtypes A and B at different time points. Scoring criteria were used to evaluate the degree of severity. A total of 40 infants were determined to be RSV\u2010positive, nine were identified as RSV subtype A (RSVA), and 31 were RSV subtype B (RSVB). The peak RSV load was observed upon admission, and the RSV load decreased significantly over time; in addition, this decrease began to have significant differences on day 5. There was a positive correlation between the RSV load and the clinical score (r(2) = 0.121 and P \u003C 0.001). According to the clinical scores, the infants in the severe group tended to have higher RSV loads than those in the moderate and mild groups. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that the viral load on day 3 was independently associated with the degree of severity. This study elucidated that a higher mean RSV load was associated with a more severe disease and a longer duration of hospitalization and symptoms.

In this study we will develop, pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship programme in China\u2019s primary care hospitals to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections among all ages. METHODS: We will use a parallel-group, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation but unblinded treatment (providers and patients). We will randomise 34 primary care hospitals from two counties within Guangdong province into the intervention and control arm (1:1 overall ratio) stratified by county (8:9 within-county ratio). In the control arm, antibiotic prescribing and management will continue through usual care. In the intervention arm, we will implement an antibiotic stewardship programme targeting family physicians and patients/caregivers. The family physician components include: (1) training using new operational guidelines, (2) improved management and peer-review of antibiotic prescribing, (3) improved electronic medical records and smart phone app facilitation. The patient/caregiver component involves patient education via family physicians, leaflets and videos. The primary outcome is the proportion of prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (excluding pneumonia) that contain any antibiotic(s). Secondary outcomes will address how frequently specific classes of antibiotics are prescribed, how frequently key non-antibiotic alternatives are prescribed and the costs of consultations. We will conduct a qualitative process evaluation to explore operational questions regarding acceptability, cultural appropriateness and burden of technology use, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term benefit evaluation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months, with another 24 months\u2019 post-trial long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION: Our study is one of the first trials to evaluate the effect of an antibiotic stewardship programme in primary care settings in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC). All interventional activities will be designed to be embedded into routine primary care with strong local ownership. Through the trial we intend to impact on clinical practice and national policy in antibiotic prescription for primary care facilities in rural China and other LMICs.

METHODS: The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed. RESULTS: Total lymphocytes, CD4(\u002B) T cells, CD8(\u002B) T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases. The subsets showed a significant association with inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially CD8(\u002B) T cells and CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) ratio. After treatment, 37 patients (67%) showed clinical response, with an increase in CD8(\u002B) T cells and B cells. No significant change in any subset was detected in nonresponsive cases.

In the respiratory panel presented, 18 assays were each set up in triplicate, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate.

Representative data are presented for one RNA target (influenza A matrix) and one DNA target (equine herpesvirus 1).

Our aim was to evaluate clinical and serological differences in infants with bronchiolitis from a single or from multiple viruses. Our secondary aim was to investigate differences in recurrent wheezing episodes after 12\u201024\u201036 months of follow\u2010up. We reviewed the clinical records for 486 full\u2010term infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis with at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. In 431 (88.7%) patients one virus was detected and in 55 (11.3%) infants more than one virus was found. No differences were observed in the length of hospitalization, clinical severity score, O(2) supplementation or admission to the intensive care unit. Single virus was associated with higher serum C\u2010reactive protein (C\u2010RP) than infants with multiple viruses and higher blood neutrophil counts. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected virus. RSV alone was associated with higher C\u2010RP (P = 0.007), compared to RSV coinfection. Infants with human rhinovirus (hRV) alone had higher white blood cell counts, higher blood neutrophils, and higher serum C\u2010RP levels than hRV co\u2010infection (P = 0.029, P = 0.008, P = 0.008). RSV \u002B hRV, the most frequent co\u2010infection, was associated with lower neutrophil count and lower C\u2010RP levels (P = 0.008, P = 0.016) and less fever (P = 0.012), when comparing RSV versus hRV versus RSV \u002B hRV. No differences were found in the frequency of recurrent wheezing between single versus multiple viruses after bronchiolitis.

Cell cycle arrest was induced by cimiside E in S phase at a lower concentration (30 \u00B5M) and G2/M phase at higher concentrations (60 and 90 \u00B5M). Cimiside E mediated apoptosis through the induction of the caspase cascade for both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis. Given the long turnaround of RT-PCR, the gold standard diagnostic technique, chest CT plays a pivotal role in the triage of patients presenting at the emergency department, allowing them to be hospitalized in \u0022COVID\u0022 or \u0022non-COVID\u0022 units. Baseline CT scan must be performed without contrast, but injection is necessary in case of suspected pulmonary embolism, which could be quite frequent in this disease. The typical CT appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia consists of bilateral, peripheral, posterior and basal ground-glass opacities. CT extent of pulmonary lesions correlates with clinical disease severity and should be mentioned in the radiologic report. Given the considerable number of chest CT scans performed during this epidemic, it is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnea. AI techniques could allow for reliable automated diagnosis and quantification of disease extent.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lod\u00E9, Baptiste; Jalaber, Carole; Orcel, Thibaud; Morcet-Delattre, Thibaud; Crespin, Nikolas; Voisin, Steven; Billard, F\u00E9lix; Luzi, St\u00E9phanie; Lapotre, Thibaut; Lentz, Pierre-Axel; Revel, Marie-Pierre; Lederlin, Mathieu","journal":"Journal d\u0026#039;imagerie diagnostique et interventionnelle","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6304acbdcc76c48c41ea2b7175163021bc157e1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jidi.2020.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2543343120300774; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2543343120300774?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Summary The COVID","The typical","pneumonie COVID","the differential diagnosis","pivotal role in the triage","should be mentioned in the radiologic report","Given the considerable number","Given the long turnaround","the gold standard diagnostic technique","allowing them to be hospitalized in","which could be quite frequent in this disease","patients presenting at the emergency department","disease extent","it is important to be aware","but injection is necessary in case","chest","PCR","scanner thoracique","scanner initial","maladie","scan must be performed without contrast","triage des patients arrivant","techniques could allow","technique diagnostique","extension l\u00E9sionnelle","compte-rendu","pulmonary lesions correlates with clinical disease severity","scans performed during this epidemic","suspected pulmonary embolism","reliable automated diagnosis","gamme des diagnostics diff\u00E9rentiels","diagnostics automatiques fiables","pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis","plays","posterior","p\u00E9riph\u00E9riques","peripheral","bilateral","quantification","scanners thoraciques r\u00E9alis\u00E9s","basal ground","pneumonia consists","r\u00F4le pivot","cas de suspicion","Baseline","r\u00E9f\u00E9rence","appearance","plages de verre d\u00E9poli bilat\u00E9rales","vu du nombre consid\u00E9rable","embolie pulmonaire","obtention des r\u00E9sultats","acute dyspnea","glass opacities","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","atteinte scanographique typique","s\u00E9v\u00E9rit\u00E9 clinique","dyspn\u00E9e aigu\u00EB","pr\u00E9valence","d\u00E9lais","urgences","crise sanitaire","intelligence artificielle","pr\u00E9c\u00E9dent","examen","units","pand\u00E9mie","services"],"language":"fr"},

OBJECTIVE: This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. CONCLUSION: This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chavez, Summer; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex; Liang, Stephen Y.","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd207a5bc0396b2c6a91d8a8cb24408cddebd187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102516.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720301789; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720301789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","suspected patients","Symptoms of COVID","upper respiratory symptoms","Respiratory etiquette","respiratory droplets","management of patients","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","suspected cases","current understanding of COVID","acute respiratory distress syndrome","viral upper respiratory illnesses","patient symptoms","emergency physicians","non-severe pneumonia","Coronavirus Disease","evaluation","emergency department","mild disease","patient ability","review article","narrative review","hospital infection prevention","hand washing","hemodynamic status","updated approach","personal protective equipment","public health authorities","clinicians","overview","DISCUSSION","healthcare personnel","major trajectories","SARS-CoV","ft","ARDS","recommendations","self-quarantine","close contact","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","Disposition","risk","virus responsible","INTRODUCTION","global pandemic","facemask"],"language":"en"},

HMPV, which is closely related to avian metapneumovirus subtype C, has circulated for at least 65 years, and nearly every child will be infected with HMPV by the age of 5. However, immunity is incomplete, and re-infections occur throughout adult life. Symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections, ranging from mild (cough, rhinorrhea, and fever) to more severe (bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The preferred method for diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as HMPV is difficult to culture. Although there have been many advances made in the past 16 years since its discovery, there are still no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals or vaccines available to treat HMPV. Both small animal and non-human primate models have been established for the study of HMPV.

The function remains obscure and a scattered taxonomical distribution has been reported by numerous groups. METHODS: We have searched GenBank in order to identify all viral accessions that have s2m(\u2212like) sequence motifs. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses and constrained tree topology testing were also performed in order to investigate the apparently mobile nature of s2m. RESULTS: The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of \u002B ssRNA viruses; Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. In all of these virus families, with the possible exception of Caliciviridae, multiple gains and/or losses of s2m would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of this character. CONCLUSIONS: s2m appears to be a mobile genetic element with a unique evolutionary history in all of the four virus families where it can be found.

METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal swabs at clinics located in eight Latin American countries from 3,375 subjects aged 25 years or younger who presented with influenza-like illness. RESULTS: Our subjects had a median age of 3 years and a 1.2:1.0 male:female ratio. HRV was identified in 16% and HEV was identified in 3%. HRVs accounted for a higher frequency of isolates in those of younger age, in particular children \u003C 1 years old. HRV-C accounted for 38% of all HRVs detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high proportion of recombinant strains between HRV-A/HRV-C and between HEV-A/HEV-B. In addition, both EV-D68 and EV-A71 were identified.

Cells expressing S fused with receptor-expressing cells at neutral pH suggesting that the recombinant glycoprotein is functional, its membrane fusogenic activity does not require other viral proteins, and that low pH is not required for triggering membrane fusion; fusion was not observed at low receptor concentrations. S and its soluble ectodomain, Se, were not cleaved to any significant degree. They ran at about 180\u2013200kDa in SDS gels suggesting post-translational modifications as predicted by previous computer analysis and observed for other coronaviruses. Fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17\u2013537 and 272\u2013537 but not 17\u2013276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor, ACE2, recently identified by M. Farzan and co-workers [Nature 426 (2003) 450\u2013454]. Together with data for inhibition of binding by antibodies developed against peptides from S, these findings suggest that the receptor-binding domain is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537. These results also confirm that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the SARS virus and may help in the elucidation of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV entry and in the development of vaccine immunogens and entry inhibitors.","publish_time":"2003-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaodong; Chakraborti, Samitabh; Dimitrov, Anthony S; Gramatikoff, Kosi; Dimitrov, Dimiter S","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/738a53e70ef3f5c81eeaa3e8626fcead3e09688c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111010.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X03024136; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X03024136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which the OHSA was implemented at an academic hospital in Johannesburg, from the senior professional nurses and nursing managers\u2019 perspective, and to describe recommendations in order to facilitate the implementation of the Act. METHODS: A contextual, quantitative, exploratory and descriptive survey was conducted. A purposive sampling method was used to select the participants that met the inclusion criteria. A structured Likert-scale questionnaire was used to collect data (Brink 2011). Stata version 12 was used to analyse the data. Cronbach\u2019s alpha, with a cut-off point of 0.7 was used to test for internal consistency. Ethical considerations were strictly adhered to. Results are presented in the form of graphs, frequency distributions and tables. RESULTS: The study revealed that overall there is 93.3% non-implementation of the selected sections and regulations of the OHSA. These results have serious implications on the health and safety of employees in the workplace.

Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis. The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results. Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines. In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks. The key aspects that will define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio","journal":"Expert Opin Biol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96f9e6b75c3611899eb5ac11c03ca4b372bd83a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250170/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2020.1752177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of vaccines","influenza vaccines","development of low-cost vaccines","antibodies useful","pandemic","anti-COVID","Plant biotechnology","fight","clinical evaluations","clinical trials","potential solutions","therapy","human use","longer time","short term","valuable tools","prophylaxis","market","exploitation","future outbreaks","available technologies","encouraging results","biopharmaceuticals","therapeutic enzyme","dramatic impact","key aspects","examples","candidates","diagnosis","companies","end","virus"],"language":"en"},

Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9 h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.","publish_time":"2005-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganapathy, Kannan; Cargill, Peter Walker; Jones, Richard Charles","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/653fbf95b5df8cd232e65d624a10adf18eb61749.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119624.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405000406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405000406","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h of storage","h of cold storage","virus isolation","tracheal washes","kidney","rectum","accurate sampling","sampling times","sampling points","tracheal organ cultures","RT-PCR","ECE","dead chicken carcasses","survivability of infectious bronchitis virus","cold room","virulent IBV Massachusetts strain M41","embryonated chicken eggs","nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","TOC","free chickens","detection","week-old specific-pathogen","Levels of IgA","research purposes","local antibodies","addition","order","necropsies","lungs","days"],"language":"en"},

It was shown that treating cells with IFN after infection resulted in an increase in virus transcription but an overall decrease in virus protein synthesis. As there was no obvious decrease in the overall levels of cellular protein synthesis in infected cells treated with IFN, these results suggested that ISG56/IFIT1 selectively inhibits the translation of viral mRNAs. This conclusion was supported by in vitro translation studies. Previous work has shown that ISG56/IFIT1 can restrict the replication of viruses lacking a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity, an enzyme that methylates the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of ribose sugars in the 5\u2032-cap structures of mRNA. However, the data in the current study strongly suggested that PIV5 mRNAs are methylated at the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group and thus that ISG56/IFIT1 selectively inhibits the translation of PIV5 mRNA by some as yet unrecognized mechanism. It was also shown that ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the IFN-induced inhibition of PIV5.","publish_time":"2013-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrejeva, J.; Norsted, H.; Habjan, M.; Thiel, V.; Goodbourn, S.; Randall, R.

The C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein was defined to be the Q891(1b)-S892(1b)dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 15,129 to 15,134 (Liu and Brown, 1995). In this report, other cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF 1b region were mapped by coexpression, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Using two ORF 1b-specific antisera, V58 and V17, three more Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds, encoded by nucleotides 16,929 to 16,934, 18,492 to 18,497, and 19,506 to 19,511, respectively, were demonstrated to be the cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. Cleavage at these four positions would result in the release of four mature products with molecular masses of approximately 68, 58, 39, and 35 kDa. Among them, the 39- and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells.

Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","publish_time":"2017-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendenhall, Ian H.; Skiles, Maggie M.; Neves, Erica Sena; Borthwick, Sophie A.; Low, Dolyce H.W.; Liang, Benjamin; Lee, Benjamin P.Y.-H.; Su, Yvonne C.F.; Smith, Gavin J.D.","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b05c7d68086daf67e216e3df0ae0477343632d03.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3c9f18f46f3aef0543e0e61213dd187af135f87b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5678831.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771417300332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159263/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771417300332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2017.10.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eonycteris"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Laos","Bangladesh","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["diversity of astroviruses","astroviruses useful","presence of astroviruses","insectivorous bats","lepidus sequences","spelaea sequences","Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences","Eoncyteris sequences","Juvenile status of bats","host ecology","host phylogenetic relatedness","Laos","Singapore","reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity","virus maintenance","Rhinolophus lepidus","astrovirus infection","Eonycteris spelaea","study","wide diversity of bat species","virus evolutionary history","phylogenetic relations","high rates","variable shedding","temporal shedding trends","Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces","co-infections","Rousettus","polymerase genes","roosting behavior","epidemiology","distinct clade","China","unique mammals","predictive framework","risk factor","population characteristics","Pteropus giganteus","spillover","addition","Bangladesh","features","majority","humans"],"language":"en"},

Results showed that transaminase levels markedly decreased in MHV-A59-infected mice treated with MAb anti-IL-17A whereas plasmatic Ig concentration sharply increased. Conversely, MAb anti-IL-17F enhanced transaminase liberation and did not affect Ig levels. Serum IFN\u03B3 was detected in mice infected with MHV-A59 and its concentration increased after MAb anti-IL-17A administration. Besides, MAb anti-IFN\u03B3 greatly augmented transaminase plasmatic levels.

The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures.

Thus, understanding mechanisms of antibody-mediated viral inhibition and neutralization escape is critical. Here, a robust yeast display system for fine epitope mapping of viral surface hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies is demonstrated. The full-length H5 subtype HA (HA0) was expressed on the yeast surface in a correctly folded conformation, determined by binding of a panel of extensively characterized neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs target conformationally-dependent epitopes of influenza A HA, which are highly conserved across H5 clades and group 1 serotypes. By separately displaying HA1 and HA2 subunits on yeast, domain mapping of two anti-H5 mAbs, NR2728 and H5-2A, localized their epitopes to HA1. These anti-H5 mAb epitopes were further fine mapped by using a library of yeast-displayed HA1 mutants and selecting for loss of binding without prior knowledge of potential contact residues. By overlaying key mutant residues that impacted binding onto a crystal structure of HA, the NR2728 mAb was found to interact with a fully surface-exposed contiguous patch of residues at the receptor binding site (RBS), giving insight into the mechanism underlying its potent inhibition of virus binding. The non-neutralizing H5-2A mAb was similarly mapped to a highly conserved H5 strain-specific but poorly accessible location on a loop at the trimer HA interface. These data further augment our toolchest for studying HA antigenicity, epitope diversity and accessibility in response to natural and experimental influenza infection and vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Thomas; Sui, Jianhua; Bennett, Andrew S.; Liddington, Robert C.; Donis, Ruben O.; Zhu, Quan; Marasco, Wayne A.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc16f9ef2d3d06d771c33351ced68c844f4136b8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6e5d1a659a1a50b1208e89e152e9125938d047b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3119598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21569761/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3119598?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X11007467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X11007467; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-H5 mAbs","H5 clades","full-length H5 subtype HA","anti-H5 mAb epitopes","yeast surface","HA antigenicity","non-neutralizing H5","loss of binding","conserved H5 strain-specific","crystal structure of HA","trimer HA interface","library of yeast","NR2728 mAb","receptor binding site","dependent epitopes of influenza","potent inhibition of virus binding","fine epitope mapping of viral surface hemagglutinin","viral inhibition","mAbs target","specific antibodies","HA1 mutants","surface-exposed contiguous patch of residues","robust yeast display system","experimental influenza infection","key mutant residues","domain mapping","epitope diversity","neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies","pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses","prior knowledge of potential contact residues","response","accessibility","debilitating pandemic threat","accessible location","loop","HA2 subunits","HA0","neutralization escape","insight","vaccines","RBS","panel","group","folded conformation","mechanisms of antibody","serotypes","data"],"language":"en"},

There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline chronic gastroenteropathy. This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting (n = 25), with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea (n = 2) or diarrhea alone (n = 3). Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea, and if they were panhypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, hypocobalaminemic, or had a Spec fPL \u22655.4 \u00B5g/L. Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks. Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a numeric reduction in the number of vomiting episodes over the 4-week period, but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions. When looking within dietary groups, significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69.1, 73.3, and 63.2% (p values of 0.008, 0.003, and 0.029) in weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when compared to week 0. The probability of vomiting also showed significant reductions in cats fed Diet A between weeks 0 and 2, 3, and 4, with odds ratios of 0.008, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively (p values of 0.038, 0.23, and 0.23). Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline chronic vomiting. Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2- to 4-week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease.","publish_time":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perea, Sally C.; Marks, Stanley L.; Daristotle, Leighann; Koochaki, Patricia E.; Haydock, Richard","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/600daeb2ed49a45c29ca225659768556fcee30d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5423899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28540291/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of feline chronic vomiting","history of vomiting","history of chronic vomiting","veterinary therapeutic diets","majority of cats","veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula","probability of vomiting","veterinary therapeutic formulas","Management of feline chronic gastroenteropathies","management of feline chronic gastroenteropathy","available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets","number of vomiting episodes","weeks","use of dietary intervention","history of concurrent diarrhea","clinical signs of vomiting","management of food","significant differences","significant reductions","dietary interventions","dietary groups","dietary approach","non-specific gastrointestinal disorders","limited novel","infectious disease","underlying disease","week period","week trial","p values","steroid-responsive enteropathies","hydrolyzed ingredient formula","multi-center study","inflammatory bowel disease","hydrolyzed ingredients","smaller number","numeric reduction","additional diagnostics","diagnostic tests","hypocobalaminemic","Spec fPL","panhypoproteinemic","\u00B5g","studies","hypoalbuminemic","odds ratios","Results"],"language":"en"},

The viral entry process is generally an attractive target implicated in antiviral strategies. Using primary cells from humans and Tupaia belangeri, as well as HepaRG cells, important determinants of viral entry have been achieved. Recently, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) was identified as an HBV entry receptor and enabled the establishment of a susceptible cell line that can efficiently support HBV infection. This finding will allow a deeper understanding of the requirements for efficient HBV infection, including the elucidation of the molecular entry mechanism. In addition, pharmacological studies suggest that NTCP is able to serve as a therapeutic target. This article summarizes our current knowledge on the mechanisms of HBV entry and the role of NTCP in this process.","publish_time":"2014-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watashi, Koichi; Urban, Stephan; Li, Wenhui; Wakita, Takaji","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3e94bce63878a41d45d22c012a9492d079b3b7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3958888.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms15022892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","NTCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of HBV entry","HBV entry receptor","efficient HBV infection","current anti-HBV drugs","viral entry process","development of new anti-HBV agents","molecular entry mechanism","important determinants of viral entry","role of NTCP","HepaRG cells","primary cells","attractive target","current knowledge","therapeutic target","nucleos","ide analogs","establishment","risk of developing liver cirrhosis","elucidation","Tupaia belangeri","interferon-based regimens","requirements","Chronic hepatitis B virus","major public health problem","hepatocellular carcinoma","deeper understanding","humans","sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide","pharmacological studies","susceptible cell line","antiviral strategies","people","addition","finding","article"],"language":"en"},

These predictions are often based on parasite optima or evolutionary equilibria derived from models of host-parasite dynamics. Yet even when such models accurately capture the parasite optima, newly invading parasites will typically not be at their optima. Here we show that parasite invasion of a host population can occur despite highly nonoptimal virulence. Fitness improvements soon after invasion may proceed through many steps with wide changes in virulence, because fitness depends on transmission as well as virulence, and transmission improvements can overwhelm nonoptimal virulence. This process is highly sensitive to mutation supply and the strength of selection. Importantly, the same invasion principle applies to the evolution of established parasites, whenever mutants arise that overcome host immunity/resistance. A host population may consequently experience repeated invasions of new parasite variants and possible large shifts in virulence as it evolves in an arms race with the parasite. An experimental study of phage lysis time and examples of mammalian viruses matching some of these characteristics are reviewed.","publish_time":"2008-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bull, James J; Ebert, Dieter","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d086f62864fb6b39416bad3b5a969668b1791acb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3352400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00003.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of parasite virulence","parasite optima","parasite invasion","nonoptimal virulence","parasite dynamics","models of host","host population","enterprise of virulence management attempts","host immunity","repeated invasions of new parasite variants","transmission improvements","Fitness improvements","invasion principle","evolution of established parasites","invading parasites","possible large shifts","experimental study of phage lysis time","examples of mammalian viruses","mutation supply","social practices","mutants","factors","evolutionary equilibria","wide changes","steps","strength of selection","process","arms race","characteristics","resistance","predictions"],"language":"en"},

We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (\u003E18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. RESULTS: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 \u00B1 20 years, 22 [71 %] males). Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU. Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio = 18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11\u2013302.1, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.

AIM: To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey, in March 2020. SETTING: Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 regional prevalence categorised as high (\u003E25), medium (15\u201325) and low prevalence (\u003C15) COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: Seven high, five medium and four low prevalence hospices provided data. Two high prevalence hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response. CONCLUSION: The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The emergence of highly pathogenic strains like the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the discovery of two new coronaviruses, NL-63 and HKU1, corroborates the high rate of mutation and recombination that have enabled them to cross species barriers and infect novel hosts. For that reason, the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that are effective against several members of this family is highly desirable. This goal can be accomplished by designing inhibitors against a target, such as the main protease 3CL(pro) (M(pro)), which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. Here 3CL(pro) derived from the SARS-CoV was used as the primary target to identify a new class of inhibitors containing a halomethyl ketone warhead. The compounds are highly potent against SARS 3CL(pro) with K(i)\u0027s as low as 300 nM. The crystal structure of the complex of one of the compounds with 3CL(pro) indicates that this inhibitor forms a thioether linkage between the halomethyl carbon of the warhead and the catalytic Cys 145. Furthermore, Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies of these compounds have led to the identification of a pharmacophore that accurately defines the essential molecular features required for the high affinity.","publish_time":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bacha, Usman; Barrila, Jennifer; Gabelli, Sandra B.; Kiso, Yoshiaki; Amzel, L.

SUMMARY As the medical use of so called \u201Ctherapeutic cannabis\u0022 is in the process of being approved in France, the opening to its recreational use is the next logical step, as it has been always the chronology followed in all countries. Indeed, those who have legalized the drug have previously approved its therapeutic use. This \u0027justifying a project phase\u0027 stage seems unavoidable. Therefore, it is appropriate to recall the effects and misdeeds of the drug during its recreational use. The general population surveys carried out in France for 25 years by public health France and the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction, have followed the evolution of psychoactive substances consumption. Particular attention was focused on cannabis use, which, in a context of wide dissemination for a quarter of a century, rose steadily higher among younger generations, but also among older adults. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of cannabis use among young people and adults. Last 25 years, its diffusion has continued to expand, and the experimentation rate multiplied by near 4. Estimated at 12.7% in 1992, it reached 44.8% in 2017. Moreover, 25% of users in the year aged from 18 to 64 years old were at high risk of problematic use or dependence in 2017. This figure is worrying because it is constantly increasing; it affects 3% of 18-64-year-old, just over a million people.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goull\u00E9, Jean-Pierre; Guerbet, Michel","journal":"Bull Acad Natl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd3c8c5842f8c29e7fada03a59d313e4cf4e982f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920301710?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920301710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["is in the process","legalized the drug","followed the evolution","always the chronology followed in","France is the European country with the highest prevalence","the opening to its recreational","the drug during its recreational","dependence in","users in the year aged from","is the next logical step","SUMMARY As the medical","being approved in France","it is appropriate to recall the effects","The general population surveys carried out in France","the experimentation rate multiplied","therapeutic cannabis","ans","as it","usages de cannabis","its diffusion","it affects","public health France","Sant\u00E9 publique France","it reached","usage r\u00E9cr\u00E9atif","This figure is worrying because it is constantly increasing","usage probl\u00E9matique","usage m\u00E9dical","previously approved its therapeutic","continued to expand","Drug Addiction","among young people","million people","pays europ\u00E9en","th\u00E9rapeutique","years old were at high risk","contexte de large diffusion","but also among older adults","\u00E9volution de la consommation","pr\u00E9valence de consommation","Estimated at","substances psychoactives","m\u00E9faits de la drogue","million de personnes","jeunes g\u00E9n\u00E9rations","rose steadily higher among younger generations","population g\u00E9n\u00E9rale r\u00E9alis\u00E9es","psychoactive substances consumption","wide dissemination for","Particular attention was focused","misdeeds","so called","century","problematic","Observatory","project phase","which","Drugs","those who","Observatoire fran\u00E7ais des drogues","justifying","just over","Therefore","countries","stage seems unavoidable","risque \u00E9lev\u00E9","toxicomanies","effets","suite logique","near","Indeed","port\u00E9e","enqu\u00EAtes","cadre","ouverture","plante","image de la chronologie","quart de si\u00E8cle","justification","emploi","\u00E9tape","heure","d\u00E9pendance","taux","exp\u00E9rimentation","progression constante","v\u00E9g\u00E9tal","ann\u00E9e","R\u00C9SUM\u00C9","Moreover","usagers","chiffre","surcro\u00EEt"],"language":"fr"},

Avian coronavirus (Gammacoronavirus) was detected in quail not vaccinated against Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and in pheasants vaccinated with an IBV Massachusetts serotype. Based on DNA sequences for the gene encoding the S protein, the avian coronaviruses detected in the quail and pheasant are related to the IBV 793B and Massachusetts types, respectively. However, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses showed the susceptibility of quail also to Deltacoronaviruses, suggesting that quail and pheasant avian coronaviruses share spike genes identical to chicken IBV spike genes and quail might host Deltacoronavirus.","publish_time":"2016-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, C.

Here we report the first use of a fully-human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) produced from hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic (Tc) cattle immunized with a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus vaccine. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation study in six cohorts of 3\u201310 participants who were randomly assigned by a computer-generated table to receive 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-301 or placebo on Day 0, and were followed by clinical, laboratory, and pharmacokinetic assessments on days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42 and 90. The primary outcome was safety whereas pharmacokinetic profile, MERS virus neutralization assay over time (pharmacodynamics), and immunogenicity were secondary outcomes. The analysis was performed on the intention to treat population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02788188. FINDINGS: We randomized 38 participants (28 to SAB-301 and 10 to placebo). Ninety-seven adverse event (AEs) were reported: 64 AEs occurred in 23 of 28 participants (82%) receiving SAB-301 (mean 2.3 AEs per participant), and 33 AEs occurred in 10 of 10 participants (100%) receiving placebo (mean 3.3 AEs per participant). The most common AEs were headache, albuminuria, elevated creatine kinase, and common cold, and occurred in similar proportions as placebo. Single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) demonstrated relatively linear and dose-proportional increases in maximal concentration and area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC(0\u201324)), and the PK strongly correlated with the microneutralization assay (R(2)=0.845, p\u003C0.001). The AUC in the 50 mg/kg dose (27498.18 \u03BCg*days/mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with protection in a preclinical model. The average terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) was ~ 28 days. INTERPRETATION: Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. Tc cattle derived human immunoglobulin offers a new platform technology to produce fully-human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin for other medical conditions.

However, Chinese medicine doctors (CMDs) follow the traditional treatment rules to select or administer these diverse Chinese medicine formulae. The main purpose of our study was to explore data on the frequency of medication and medication habits by CMDs for the treatment of URTIs with Chinese herbs and Chinese medicine formulae. METHODS: The TCM treatments for patients consulting with an URTIs were analyzed from the National Health Insurance Research Database using the appropriate codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses for Taiwan in 2009. A data mining and association rules, were used to analyze co-prescriptions of TCM for patients with URTIs. RESULTS: For 472,005 patients who sought the treatment of URTIs, a total of 46,805 patients with URTIs received TCM treatments, of these 29,052 patients sought both TCM and Western medication treatments. Of the URTIs patients who had received a TCM treatment, 79% presented with an acute common cold, 9% had influenza, and 9% had acute upper respiratory infections. Furthermore, 53.89% of the sample were aged between 20 and 49 years, and 62.84% were women, 3.56% of the patients used Yin-Qiao-San and 2.76% used Jie-Geng. Yin-Qiao-San and Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang were the most commonly combinations of prescriptions for patients with URTIs. CONCLUSIONS: The patients experiencing URTIs were more likely to request TCM treatment if their symptoms were mild and they were women. The Chinese medicine doctors treating URTIs generally followed TCM theory. A coding system for TCM diagnostic classifications could improve evaluations of TCM treatments.","publish_time":"2014-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jung-Sheng; Ho, Chung-Han; Hsu, Yao-Chin; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Hsieh, Ching-Liang","journal":"Eur J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29e5af225df7e2a729996aa1bc1fd0dc8e43caae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102745.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288884/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2014.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382014000894; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382014000894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","National Health Insurance Research Database","International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["URTIs patients","treatment of URTIs","TCM theory","evaluations of TCM treatments","Chinese medicine doctors","co-prescriptions of TCM","Traditional Chinese medicine","TCM diagnostic classifications","Chinese herbs","diverse Chinese medicine formulae","traditional treatment rules","Western medication treatments","CMDs","medication habits","San","frequency of medication","acute upper respiratory infections","Yin-Qiao","women","years","upper respiratory tract infections","common colds","association rules","combinations of prescriptions","data mining","Revision","appropriate codes","Ma-Xing","National Health Insurance Research Database","International Classification of Diseases","Clinical Modification diagnoses","Gan-Shi","Asian countries","Taiwan","Tang","coding system","symptoms","INTRODUCTION","total","study","influenza","METHODS","main purpose","CONCLUSIONS","Jie-Geng","RESULTS","sample"],"language":"en"},

Recently, it has been reported that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 domain of PEDV spike protein is responsible for binding to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor. Therefore, the NTD of S1 domain could be an attractive target for the development of subunit vaccines. In this study, the NTD spanning amino acid residues 25-229 (S25-229) of S1 domain of PEDV variant strain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). S25-229 IBs were solubilized in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) buffer containing 8 M urea and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 95% yield.

The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 \u03BCg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native PEDV S protein in an immunofluorescence assay. These results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against PEDV variant strains.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piao, Da-Chuan; Lee, Yoon-Seok; Bok, Jin-Duck; Cho, Chong-Su; Hong, Zhong-Shan; Kang, Sang-Kee; Choi, Yun-Jaie","journal":"Protein Expr Purif","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173294.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592816300973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27260969/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592816300973; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2016.05.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["Solubilized S25","PEDV variant strains","\u03BCg of purified S25","S1 domain of PEDV variant strain","S1 domain of PEDV spike protein","NTD of S1 domain","CD spectrum of S25","IBs","native PEDV S protein","mouse anti-PEDV sera","N-terminal domain","development of subunit vaccines","yield","development of effective vaccines","N-acetylneuraminic acid","pathogenic variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","immune reactivity","strong reactivity","mouse antisera","amino acid residues","Neu5Ac","Asian countries","Escherichia coli BL21","attractive target","one-step cation exchange chromatography","DE3","binding","characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure","immunofluorescence assay","fold flash dilution","buffer","possible sugar co-receptor","form of inclusion bodies","emergence","immunization of mice","potent serum IgG titers","global swine industry","sodium acetate","purity","study","potential","urea","addition","dithiothreitol","indirect ELISA","results"],"language":"en"},

It is a discipline which applies informatic techniques to problems of the immune system. To a great extent, immunoinformatics is typified by epitope prediction methods. It has found disappointingly limited use in the design and discovery of new vaccines, which is an area where proper computational support is generally lacking. Most extant vaccines are not based around isolated epitopes but rather correspond to chemically-treated or attenuated whole pathogens or correspond to individual proteins extract from whole pathogens or correspond to complex carbohydrate. In this chapter we attempt to review what progress there has been in an as-yet-underexplored area of immunoinformatics: the computational discovery of whole protein antigens. The effective development of antigen prediction methods would significantly reduce the laboratory resource required to identify pathogenic proteins as candidate subunit vaccines. We begin our review by placing antigen prediction firmly into context, exploring the role of reverse vaccinology in the design and discovery of vaccines. We also highlight several competing yet ultimately complementary methodological approaches: sub-cellular location prediction, identifying antigens using sequence similarity, and the use of sophisticated statistical approaches for predicting the probability of antigen characteristics. We end by exploring how a systems immunomics approach to the prediction of immunogenicity would prove helpful in the prediction of antigens.","publish_time":"2010-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flower, Darren R; Macdonald, Isabel K; Ramakrishnan, Kamna; Davies, Matthew N; Doytchinova, Irini A","journal":"Immunome Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7a8dfcde06b70cb86b30074d9008635252d6301.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2981880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-7580-6-s2-s1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21067543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction of antigens","prediction of immunogenicity","discovery of vaccines","epitope prediction methods","discovery of new vaccines","effective development of antigen prediction methods","computational discovery","extant vaccines","sub-cellular location prediction","design","pathogens","underexplored area of immunoinformatics","candidate subunit vaccines","protein antigens","review","probability of antigen characteristics","pathogenic proteins","use of sophisticated statistical approaches","limited use","complementary methodological approaches","individual proteins extract","proper computational support","problems","sequence similarity","informatic techniques","laboratory resource","role of reverse vaccinology","context","emergent branch of informatics science","systems immunomics approach","immune system","discipline","great extent","isolated epitopes","tree of knowledge","bioinformatics","complex carbohydrate","chapter","progress"],"language":"en"},

The true origin of the ACoV is unknown, however a common ancestor between the ACoV and HCoV-229E appears to have existed prior to the 1960\u2019s, suggesting virus transmission, either as a zoonosis or anthroponosis, has occurred between alpacas and humans.","publish_time":"2012-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crossley, Beate M.; Mock, Richard E.; Callison, Scott A.; Hietala, Sharon K.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5136621ef7ae0c8d8b2dd396e432bedceb3f0331.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3528286.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23235471/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4123689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACoV","HCoV","Alpaca Coronavirus","common human coronavirus","novel coronavirus","alpacas","E isolates","common ancestor","nucleocapsid gene","entire genome","comparison of spike gene sequences","acute respiratory disease","frame","nucleotide identity","span","Full-length genomic sequencing","zoonosis","virus transmission","true origin","anthroponosis","Alphacoronaviruses","UTR","decades","humans"],"language":"en"},

Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional smallpox vaccination. Adapted to growth in avian cells MVA lost the ability to replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the genes orthopoxviruses use to conquer their host (cell) environment. As a biologically well-characterized mutant virus, MVA facilitates fundamental research to elucidate the functions of poxvirus host-interaction factors. As extremely safe viral vectors MVA vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective in various preclinical infection models. Multiple recombinant MVA currently undergo clinical testing for vaccination against human immunodeficiency viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Plasmodium falciparum. The versatility of the MVA vector vaccine platform is readily demonstrated by the swift development of experimental vaccines for immunization against emerging infections such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Recent advances include promising results from the clinical testing of recombinant MVA-producing antigens of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 or Ebola virus. This review summarizes our current knowledge about MVA as a unique strain of vaccinia virus, and discusses the prospects of exploiting this virus as research tool in poxvirus biology or as safe viral vector vaccine to challenge existing and future bottlenecks in vaccinology.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volz, A.; Sutter, G.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3734e22e57f8cfabd3ebcfc291dc3a81af82cba4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112317.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352716300380; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057259/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352716300380","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVA"],"locations":["Ankara","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["avian cells MVA","Ebola virus","MVA vector vaccine platform","Multiple recombinant MVA","clinical testing of recombinant MVA","safe viral vectors MVA vaccines","Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara","unique strain of vaccinia virus","primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara","well-characterized mutant virus","safe viral vector vaccine","pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1","generation vaccine","development of new candidate vaccines","swift development of experimental vaccines","potent vector system","poxvirus biology","fundamental research","research tool","effects of conventional smallpox vaccination","functions of poxvirus host-interaction factors","human immunodeficiency viruses","antigens","serial tissue culture passage","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","emerging infections","immunization","infectious diseases","promising results","ability","Abstract Safety","various preclinical infection models","Plasmodium falciparum","future bottlenecks","current knowledge","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","cancer","versatility","prospects","Recent advances","vaccinology","review","growth","mammalian hosts","genes orthopoxviruses","environment"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to describe the molecular characteristics of the RdRP and VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains identified as the most frequent etiologic agent in a neonatal diarrhea outbreak in a high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd. Preliminary laboratory analysis ruled out important enteropathogens (Cryptosporidium spp; Eimeria spp., E. coli F5, and bovine coronavirus). Fecal samples from diarrheic (n = 24) and asymptomatic (n = 5) calves up to 30 days old were collected for virological analysis. RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection of aichivirus B RdRP and VP1 genes and for rotavirus A VP7 and VP4 genes in fecal samples. Asymptomatic calves (control group) were negative for both viruses. Aichivirus B and rotavirus A G10P[11] genotypes were found in 54.2% (13/24) and 25% (6/24) of the diarrheic fecal samples, respectively. Aichivirus B was only identified (83.3%, 10/12) in calves up to two weeks old. Phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRP gene grouped the Brazilian strains in a new branch within the aichivirus B group. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the VP1 gene of Brazilian and Chinese aichivirus B strains allowed the strains identified in this study to be classified in the putative lineage 1. This is the first description of a high rate of aichivirus B detection in a diarrhea outbreak in dairy calves, and the first phylogenetic study of the VP1 gene of aichivirus B wild-type strains performed in South America.","publish_time":"2017-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ribeiro, Juliane; Lorenzetti, Elis; J\u00FAnior, Jos\u00E9 Carlos Ribeiro; da Silva Medeiros, Thais Neris; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89fd297ec9045f0c0a0beefdac2fa50ee5b198b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086745.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3531-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aichivirus","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South America"],"keyphrases":["aichivirus B group","VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains","Chinese aichivirus B strains","detection of aichivirus B RdRP","high rate of aichivirus B detection","VP1 gene of aichivirus B wild-type strains","Brazilian strains","dairy calves","Asymptomatic calves","VP1 gene of Brazilian","RdRP gene","Phylogenetic analysis","diarrheic fecal samples","phylogenetic study","Comparative analysis","virological analysis","neonatal diarrhea outbreak","VP4 genes","rotavirus","Preliminary laboratory analysis","high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd","adult cattle","control group","days old","weeks old","VP7","new branch","frequent etiologic agent","nucleotide sequence","Eimeria","coli F5","molecular characteristics","Cryptosporidium spp","G10P","South America","bovine coronavirus","description","RT-PCR assays","genotypes","putative lineage","viruses","aim"],"language":"en"},

Responding effectively to a pandemic relies on the majority of medical, nursing, laboratory and hotel services staff continuing to work normally. Planning assumes that during a pandemic normal healthcare service levels will be provided, although it anticipates that as caseloads increase only essential care will be provided. The ability of the NHS to provide expected service levels is entirely dependent upon HCWs continuing to work as normal. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as a two-phase multi-method study, incorporating focus groups and a questionnaire survey. In phase one, qualitative methods will be used to collect the views of a purposive sample of HCWs, to determine the range of factors associated with their responses to the prospect of working through pandemic influenza. In phase two, the findings from the focus groups, combined with the available literature, will be used to inform the design of a survey to determine the generalisability of these factors, enabling the estimation of the likely proportion of HCWs affected by each factor, and how likely it is that they would be willing and/or able to continue to work during an influenza pandemic. DISCUSSION: There are potentially greater than normal health risks for some healthcare workers working during a pandemic, and these workers may be concerned about infecting family members/friends. HCWs will be as liable as other workers to care for sick family members and friends. It is vital to have information about how motivated HCWs will be to continue to work during such a crisis, and what factors might influence their decision to work/not to work. Through the identification and subsequent management of these factors it may be possible to implement strategies that will alleviate the concerns and fears of HCWs and remove potential barriers to working.","publish_time":"2008-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Draper, Heather; Wilson, Sue; Ives, Jonathan; Gratus, Christine; Greenfield, Sheila; Parry, Jayne; Petts, Judith; Sorell, Tom","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86680d2981c3e641e014e777c8769031b89f933e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2423372.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18518971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","NHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic","fears of HCWs","motivated HCWs","Healthcare workers","likely proportion of HCWs","pandemic normal healthcare service levels","purposive sample of HCWs","range of factors","focus groups","friends","DESIGN","expected service levels","normal health risks","infecting family members","sick family members","questionnaire survey","qualitative methods","essential care","two-phase multi-method study","nursing","laboratory","key players","majority of medical","hotel services staff","NHS","estimation","identification","subsequent management","responses","information","concerns","views","potential barriers","findings","prospect","BACKGROUND","available literature","line of exposure","infection","strategies","caseloads","generalisability","Planning","DISCUSSION","crisis","decision"],"language":"en"},

Despite great advances in the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relapse and metastasis in NPC patients remain major causes of mortality. Evidence accumulated over recent years indicates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC and inhibition of EBV reactivation is now being considered as a goal for the therapy of EBV-associated cancers. With this in mind, a panel of dietary compounds was screened and emodin was found to have potential anti-EBV activity. Through Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis, we show that emodin inhibits the expression of EBV lytic proteins and blocks virion production in EBV- positive epithelial cell lines. In investigating the underlying mechanism, reporter assays indicated that emodin represses Zta promoter (Zp) and Rta promoter (Rp) activities, triggered by various inducers. Mapping of the Zp construct reveals that the SP1 binding region is important for emodin-triggered repression and emodin is shown to be able to inhibit SP1 expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits EBV reactivation by suppression of SP1 expression. Moreover, we also show that emodin inhibits the tumorigenic properties induced by repeated EBV reactivation, including micronucleus formation, cell proliferation, migration, and matrigel invasiveness. Emodin administration also represses the tumor growth in mice which is induced by EBV activation. Taken together, our results provide a potential chemopreventive agent in restricting EBV reactivation and NPC recurrence.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Chung-Chun; Chen, Mei-Shu; Cheng, Yu-Jhen; Ko, Ying-Chieh; Lin, Su-Fang; Chiu, Ing-Ming; Chen, Jen-Yang","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06753b3e708ad76787b100b9009ccec622f267ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6896023.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31731581/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11111795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapy of EBV","EBV activation","repeated EBV reactivation","inhibition of EBV reactivation","expression of EBV lytic proteins","Emodin administration","potential anti-EBV activity","emodin-triggered repression","EBV- positive epithelial cell lines","NPC patients","pathogenesis of NPC","NPC recurrence","suppression of SP1 expression","SP1 binding region","lytic replication","cell proliferation","Rta promoter","Zta promoter","important role","Zp construct","potential chemopreventive agent","blocks virion production","metastasis","micronucleus formation","migration","relapse","Epstein-Barr virus","development of radiotherapy","reporter assays","immunofluorescence","activities","chemotherapy","Rp","tumorigenic properties","flow cytometric analysis","major causes of mortality","recent years","tumor growth","mice","panel of dietary compounds","Western blotting","matrigel invasiveness","underlying mechanism","unique malignancy","epithelium","mind","great advances","results","associated cancers","various inducers","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma","Evidence","Mapping","goal","nasopharynx"],"language":"en"},

The inclusion of all these viruses in the family Togaviridae was largely based on the similarities in morphological and physical\u2013chemical properties of these viruses, and in the sizes and polarities of their genomes. In the intervening years, considerable new information on the replication strategies of these viruses and the structure and organization of their genomes has become available that has led to the reclassification or suggestions for reclassification of some of them. The replication strategy of EAV resembles that of the coronaviruses, involving a 3\u0027-coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Therefore, EAV has been suggested to be included in a virus superfamily, along with coronaviruses and toroviruses. Recent evidence indicates that LDV not only resembles EAV in morphology, virion and genome size, and number and size of their structural proteins, but also in genome organization and replication via a 3\u0027-coterminal set of mRNAs. SHFV, although not fully characterized, exhibits properties resembling those of LDV and EAV, and the recent evidence suggest that it may possess the same genome organization as these viruses. The three viruses may, therefore, represent a new family of positive-strand RNA viruses and are reviewed together in this chapter. In this chapter, emphasis is on the recent information concerning their molecular properties and pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and on the host immune responses to infections by these viruses.","publish_time":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plagemann, Peter G.W.; Moennig, Volker","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e19e91291e9436e0fe28a304a7f0a258cb6cee2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708600366; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708600366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAV","LDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rubella virus","virus superfamily","LDV","genome organization","strand RNA viruses","replication strategy of EAV","genome size","recent information","Recent evidence","equine arteritis virus","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","simian hemorrhagic fever virus","replication strategies","chemical properties","SHFV","molecular properties","genomes","reclassification","coronaviruses","chapter","coterminal nested set of mRNAs","considerable new information","new family of positive","family Togaviridae","pestiviruses","discussions","number","comprehensive reviews of nonarbotogaviruses","cell fusion agent","virion","morphology","structural proteins","similarities","intervening years","infections","structure","host immune responses","Publisher Summary","nonarboflaviviruses","pathogenesis","sizes","emphasis","toroviruses","polarities","suggestions","inclusion"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs. Considering the great animal health and economic impact of IBV as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS-coronavirus, it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in CoV infection biology and epidemiology.","publish_time":"2010-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muradrasoli, Shaman; B\u00E1lint, \u00C1d\u00E1m; Wahlgren, John; Waldenstr\u00F6m, Jonas; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Blomberg, Jonas; Olsen, Bj\u00F6rn","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8392d9561be82ded77c6e5d75f321d752776424.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2966397.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21060827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Beringia"],"keyphrases":["gamma-coronaviruses","role of wild birds","epidemiology of IBV","diverse CoVs","presence of CoVs","Beringia area","wild bird species","economic impact of IBV","future emerging pathogenic CoVs","recent emergence of novel coronaviruses","severe disease","geographic spread","environmental spread","detected viruses","Avian CoV","role of wildlife reservoirs","CoV infection biology","costly respiratory viral disease","genetic reservoir","animals","humans","RT-PCR","host range","great animal health","SARS-coronavirus","faecal samples","chickens","Infectious bronchitis virus","large distances","Sequence analysis","frequency","findings","potential medical relevance","phylogenetic analyses","present study"],"language":"en"},

Hydrodynamic injection (HI) of HBV in the mouse model is a useful tool for study of HBV replication in vivo. However, only HBV genotype A has been used for studies with HI. METHODS: We constructed 3 replication-competent clones containing 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold overlength of a HBV genotype B genome and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, A HBV genotype B clone based on the pAAV-MCS vector was constructed with the 1.3 fold HBV genome, resulting in the plasmid pAAV-HBV1.3(B) and tested by HI in C57BL/6 mice. Application of siRNA against HBx gene was tested in HBV genotype B HI mouse model. RESULTS: The 1.3 fold HBV clone showed higher replication and gene expression than the 1.1 and 1.2 fold HBV clones. Compared with pAAV-HBV1.2 (genotype A), the mice HI with pAAV-HBV1.3(B) showed higher HBsAg and HBeAg expression as well as HBV DNA replication level but a higher clearance rate. Application of two plasmids pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285 expressing a small/short interfering RNA (siRNA) to the HBx gene in HBV genotype B HI mouse model, leading to an inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. However, HBV gene expression may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, suggesting that transient suppression of HBV replication by siRNA may be insufficient to prevent viral spread, particularly if the gene silencing is not highly effective. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the HI mouse model with a HBV genotype B genome was successfully established and showed different characteristics in vivo compared with the genotype A genome. The effectiveness of gene silencing against HBx gene determines whether HBV replication may be sustainably inhibited by siRNA in vivo.","publish_time":"2013-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lei; Shen, Hong; Li, Anyi; Zhang, Zhenhua; Wang, Baoju; Wang, Junzhong; Zheng, Xin; Wu, Jun; Yang, Dongliang; Lu, Mengji; Song, Jingjiao","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76b1bad1aba249a858d1112096bbc4fbf3ae7d5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3751867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV genotype B genome","HBV genotype B clone","study of HBV replication","fold HBV genome","HBV genotype B HI mouse model","fold HBV clones","inhibition of HBV gene expression","HBV DNA replication level","transient suppression of HBV replication","HBx gene","higher replication","mice HI","effectiveness of gene silencing","replication-competent clones","different hepatitis B virus","Application of siRNA","plasmid pAAV-HBV1","HBeAg expression","fold overlength","higher HBsAg","different characteristics","pAAV-MCS vector","higher clearance rate","pSR-HBxi285","plasmids pSB-HBxi285","distinct virological characteristics","genotypes","clinical outcomes","useful tool","antiviral therapy","short interfering RNA","natural course of infection","initial delay","viral spread","Hydrodynamic injection","RESULTS","C57BL","studies","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Background Due to the COVID-19 outbreak a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, CE-certified FFP2 respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured. Method A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards was developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators. Findings 67% of the respirators brands and types received in the Catharina hospital did not meet quality criteria. Conclusion With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE approved respirators which are normally used. With this in-hospital protocol health care workers can be equipped with safe-to-use respirators.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Wezel, Ralph A.C.; Vrancken, Anne C.T.; Ernest, Marieke; Laurensse, Johan; van Doornmalen Gomez Hoyos, Josephus P.C.M.","journal":"The Journal of hospital infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eba7cc5e05b4fee8352ead322ff5d5bd8d2dc76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445773/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120302541; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120302541?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CE"],"locations":["Catharina"],"keyphrases":["quality of respirators","shortage of respirators","respirators brands","CE approved respirators","quality criteria","hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality","Catharina hospital","CE-certified FFP2 respirators","hospital protocol health care workers","quality of respiratory protective devices","healthcare workers nursing","confirmed COVID","simple verification","test","patients","total inward leak of particles","documents","visual inspection","increased supply","types","applicable standards","Conclusion","Summary Aim","Findings","Method","Background"],"language":"en"},

However, their performance characteristics and limitations must be clearly understood by both laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation.","publish_time":"2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Shu; Zhang, Wenhong; Tang, Yi-Wei","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cd74f5da199c419e5437d21910c99892245d7ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21365378/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-011-0168-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pathogens","respiratory tract viruses","routine laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections","available molecular methods","Nucleic acid-targeted molecular techniques","lack of rapid","high sensitivity","clinical practice","laboratory personnel","single reaction","accurate identification of pathogens","nonspecific clinical presentations","high-throughput processing","short test turnaround time","specificity","clinicians","sensitive tests","proper utilization","emergence of new","panel","interpretation","performance characteristics","limitations"],"language":"en"},

In 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991\u20132007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5\u20130.9 yr]: 91%, adults [\u22651 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5\u20131.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [\u22651.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6\u20134.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [\u22655 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals\u2019 odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population.","publish_time":"2009-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almberg, Emily S.; Mech, L.

Understanding the spillover from bats to humans and other animals, and the associated health risks requires an analysis of the disease dynamics in bat populations. Traditional compartmental epizootic models, which are relatively easy to implement and analyze, usually impose unrealistic aggregation assumptions about disease-related structure and depend on parameters that frequently are not measurable in field conditions. We propose a novel combination of computational and adaptive modeling approaches that address the maintenance of emerging diseases in bat colonies through individual (intra-host) models of the response of the host to a viral challenge. The dynamics of the individual models are used to define survival, susceptibility and transmission conditions relevant to epizootics as well as to develop and parametrize models of the disease evolution into uniform and diverse populations. Applications of the proposed approach to modeling the effects of immunological heterogeneity on the dynamics of bat rabies are presented.","publish_time":"2008-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimitrov, Dobromir T.; Hallam, Thomas G.; Rupprecht, Charles E.; McCracken, Gary F.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3007489c6714d99d180ce21a212f51bdd9dd709e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126102.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.08.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519308004219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18761020/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308004219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat populations","disease dynamics","dynamics of bat rabies","individual models","bat colonies","disease evolution","disease reservoirs","disease-related structure","diverse populations","Traditional compartmental epizootic models","intra-host","field conditions","maintenance of emerging diseases","adaptive modeling approaches","transmission conditions relevant","survival","analysis","Ebola","animals","susceptibility","effects of immunological heterogeneity","response","Marburg","uniform","novel combination of computational","unrealistic aggregation assumptions","associated health risks","epizootics","SARS","proposed approach","reemerging viruses","bats","humans","parameters","viral challenge","spillover","Applications"],"language":"en"},

The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes. Livestock were left unconfined on eight farms (25.8%) that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes.

OBJECTIVES: The potential reemergence of H7N9 during next year\u0027s influenza season demand a further understanding of this important disease. METHODS: Between March 1 and April 30, 2013, we obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiologic and radiologic features, and virologic data from three laboratory\u2010confirmed patients of A H7N9 infection admitted in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. RESULTS: All patients were middle to old aged (mean age 62 years) and overweight (mean body mass index 31) patients. Two patients were exposed to poultry directly or indirectly in food market. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Time between onset of symptoms and onset of respiratory failure (days) were 7\u201311 days. Two patients presented secondary invasive bacterial infections. All patients died on day 7 to day 86 after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Cross species poultry\u2010to\u2010person transmission of this new reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus can result in severe and fatal respiratory disease like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans.

It is expected to drive system changes in terms of new formal and informal institutional and organisational arrangements. This study, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a zoonotic problem requiring an OH approach, sought to understand the institutionalisation process at national and subnational levels in an early adopting country, Kenya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Social network analysis methodologies were used. Stakeholder roles and relational data were collected at national and subnational levels in 2012. Key informants from stakeholder organisations were interviewed, guided by a checklist. Public sector animal and public health organisations were interviewed first to identify other stakeholders with whom they had financial, information sharing and joint cooperation relationships. Visualisation of the OH social network and relationships were shown in sociograms and mathematical (degree and centrality) characteristics of the network summarised. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two and 20 stakeholders relevant to OH were identified at national and subnational levels, respectively. Their roles spanned wildlife, livestock, and public health sectors as well as weather prediction. About 50% of national-level stakeholders had made significant progress on OH institutionalisation to an extent that formal coordination structures (zoonoses disease unit and a technical working group) had been created. However, the process had not trickled down to subnational levels although cross-sectoral and sectoral collaborations were identified. The overall binary social network density for the stakeholders showed that 35 and 21% of the possible ties between the RVF and OH stakeholders existed at national and subnational levels, respectively, while public health actors\u2019 collaborations were identified at community/grassroots level. We recommend extending the OH network to include the other 50% stakeholders and fostering of the process at subnational-level building on available cross-sectoral platforms.","publish_time":"2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kimani, Tabitha; Ngigi, Margaret; Schelling, Esther; Randolph, Tom","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71195817c4cfe2c8b7bc13418d2062226a71d0e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4916260.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3402/iee.v6.31191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27330042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["OH stakeholders","OH network","subnational levels","OH social network","national-level stakeholders","OH institutionalisation","OH approach","public health organisations","stakeholders relevant","public health sectors","subnational-level building","health issues","public health actors\u2019 collaborations","sectoral collaborations","Social network analysis methodologies","institutionalisation process","Public sector animal","overall binary social network density","RVF","grassroots level","stakeholder organisations","Stakeholder roles","available cross-sectoral platforms","terms of new formal","formal coordination structures","joint cooperation relationships","zoonoses disease unit","extent","significant progress","early adopting country","centrality","sociograms","METHODS","community","livestock","technical working group","organisational arrangements","zoonotic problem","Rift Valley fever","relational data","complex emerging policy","degree","information","system changes","characteristics","MATERIALS","wildlife","weather prediction","possible ties","study","Kenya","environmental interface","Key informants","DISCUSSION","Visualisation","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","checklist"],"language":"en"},

As such, their induction downstream of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a hallmark of the host antiviral response. The acknowledgment that several PAMPs, not just of viral origin, may induce IFN, pinpoints at these molecules as a first line of host defense against a number of invading pathogens. Acting in both autocrine and paracrine manner, IFN interferes with viral replication by inducing hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes with both direct anti-pathogenic as well as immunomodulatory activities, therefore functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. On the other hand an inverse interference to escape the IFN system is largely exploited by pathogens through a number of tactics and tricks aimed at evading, inhibiting or manipulating the IFN pathway, that result in progression of infection or establishment of chronic disease. In this review we discuss the interplay between the IFN system and some selected clinically important and challenging viruses and bacteria, highlighting the wide array of pathogen-triggered molecular mechanisms involved in evasion strategies.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coccia, Eliana M.; Battistini, Angela","journal":"Seminars in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d931dcba5e7ae4361afc140d8d80920285edc264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869307/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532315000135; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532315000135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN system","IFN pathway","viral replication","viral origin","viral propagation","hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes","recognition of pathogen","PAMPs","line of host defense","number of invading pathogens","germ-line","molecular mechanisms","molecular patterns","number of tactics","pattern recognition receptors","wide array of pathogen","host antiviral response","PRRs","bacteria","hallmark","challenging viruses","progression of infection","paracrine manner","bridge","immunomodulatory activities","interferon","inverse interference","molecules","establishment of chronic disease","adaptive immunity","tricks","evasion strategies","class of cytokines","evading","Abstract Type","pinpoints","interplay","hand","induction","ability","years","review","acknowledgment"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile, the RLR signaling pathway is also tightly regulated by host and virus to achieve the immune homeostasis between antiviral responses and virus survival. Here, we found that zebrafish TRIM25 (zbTRIM25) functioned as a positive regulator of RLR signaling pathway during red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. Post-RGNNV infection, zbTRIM25 expression was obviously inhibited and ectopic expression of zbTRIM25 led to enhanced expression of RLR signaling pathway-related genes. Overexpression and knockdown analysis revealed that zbTRIM25 promoted zebrafish RIG-I (zbRIG-I)-mediated IFN signaling and inhibited RGNNV replication. Mechanistically, zbTRIM25 bound to zbRIG-I; in particular, the SPRY domain of zbTRIM25 interacted with the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD) and repressor domain (RD) regions of zbRIG-I. zbTRIM25 promoted the K63 polyubiquitination of 2CARD and RD regions of zbRIG-I. Furthermore, zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I activation of IFN production was enhanced by K63-linked ubiquitin, indicating that zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I polyubiquitination was essential for RIG-I-triggered IFN induction. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that zbTRIM25 positively regulates the innate immune response by targeting and promoting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of zbRIG-I.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Yilin; Jia, Kuntong; Zhang, Wanwan; Xiang, Yangxi; Jia, Peng; Liu, Wei; Yi, Meisheng","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a87a6bf36af7342e6bbb2e13da6181a8c0bab27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6901795.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG","zbTRIM25 expression","ectopic expression of zbTRIM25","SPRY domain of zbTRIM25","K63-linked polyubiquitination of zbRIG","RD regions of zbRIG","virus infection","mediated IFN","K63 polyubiquitination","enhanced expression of RLR","virus survival","zebrafish RIG","Post-RGNNV infection","innate immune response","CARD","activation of IFN production","immune homeostasis","host","K63-linked ubiquitin","inhibited RGNNV replication","pathway-related genes","positive regulator of RLR","triggered IFN induction","red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","repressor domain","zebrafish TRIM25","tandem caspase activation","important roles","recruitment domains","antiviral responses","knockdown analysis","RLRs","receptors","findings","novel mechanism","Overexpression","conclusion","pathways"],"language":"en"},

The MHV 3CLpro is similar to the picornavirus 3C proteinases in the relative location of confirmed catalytic histidine and cysteine residues and in the predicted use of Q/(S, A, G) dipeptide cleavage sites. However, less is known concerning the participation of aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues in catalysis by the coronavirus 3C-like proteinases or of the precise coding sequence of 3CLpro within the gene 1 polyprotein. In this study, aspartic acid residues in MHV 3CLpro were mutated and the mutant proteinases were tested for activity in anin vitro transcleavage assay. MHV 3CLpro was not inactivated by substitutions at Asp3386(D53) or Asp3398(D65), demonstrating that they were not catalytic residues. MHV 3CLpro was able to cleave at a glutamine\u2013glycine (QG3607-8) dipeptide within the 3CLpro domain upstream from the predicted carboxy-terminal QS3635-6cleavage site of 3CLpro. The predicted full-length 3CLpro (S3334to Q3635) had an apparent mass of 27 kDa, identical to the p27 3CLpro in cells, whereas the truncated proteinase (S3334to Q3607) had an apparent mass of 24 kDa. This 28-amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation of 3CLpro rendered it inactive in atranscleavage assay. Thus, MHV 3CLpro was able to cleave at a site within the putative full-length proteinase, but the entire predicted 3CLpro domain was required for activity. These studies suggest that the coronavirus 3CL-proteinases may have a substantially different structure and catalytic mechanism than other 3C-like proteinases.","publish_time":"1997-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Yiqi; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb8f077ac24b1a0036882cbec7b4b8839d8759b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297984798; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297984798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLpro domain","MHV","C proteinases","catalytic residues","aspartic acid residues","glutamic acid residues","cysteine residues","coronavirus","mutant proteinases","cysteine proteinase","participation of aspartic acid","predicted carboxy-terminal QS3635","amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation","apparent mass","predicted use of Q","truncated proteinase","putative full-length proteinase","activity","catalytic histidine","catalytic mechanism","kDa","gene","polyprotein","dipeptide cleavage sites","S3334to Q3635","S3334to Q3607","atranscleavage assay","anin vitro transcleavage assay","mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","relative location","catalysis","picornavirus","precise coding sequence","D53","different structure","p27","cells","study","Asp3398","Asp3386","glycine","QG3607","glutamine","substitutions","chymotrypsin","D65","studies"],"language":"en"},

Although its causal factors and entire pathogenesis remain elusive, the available evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of KD is closely associated with dysregulation of immune responses to various viruses or microbes. In this short review, we address several essential aspects of the etiology of KD with respect to the immune response to infectious stimuli: 1) the role of viral infections, 2) the role of bacterial infections and the superantigen hypothesis, 3) involvement of innate immune response including pathogens/microbe-associated molecular patterns and complement pathways, and 4) the influence of genetic background on the response to infectious stimuli. Based on the clinical and experimental evidence, we discuss the possibility that a wide range of microbes and viruses could cause KD through common and distinct immune processes.","publish_time":"2019-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, Akihiro; Ikeda, Kazuyuki; Hamaoka, Kenji","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c92fafbeda15f8604281f06c7461dcec5288d303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6611380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316950/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00244","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of KD","etiology of KD","involvement of innate immune response","dysregulation of immune responses","distinct immune processes","infectious stimuli","coronary artery lesions","coronary artery aneurysms","role of bacterial infections","role of viral infections","various viruses","entire pathogenesis","available evidence","experimental evidence","wide range of microbes","pathogens","superantigen hypothesis","possibility","respect","essential aspects","influence of genetic background","pediatric vasculitis syndrome","molecular patterns","causal factors","pathways","short review","Kawasaki disease"],"language":"en"},

The optical density produced from a single dilution of test serum was compared with a standard curve and the results were read and printed out from a computer interfaced to a multichannel ELISA reader. The printed results were expressed in ELISA units. The ELISA results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test (SNT). An agreement of 90\u00B75% was obtained when reciprocal SNT titres equal to or greater than 4 and IgG ELISA units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction. Of the 370 sera, 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were SNT positive/IgG ELISA negative and 14 were SNT negative/IgG ELISA positive. When the SNT positive sera negative in the IgG ELISA were tested in an IgM ELISA, 19 were found to be positive. Thus, when the IgG and IgM ELISA results were combined the overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT increased to 95\u00B77%. The IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 82\u00B74% and specificity of 94\u00B74% relative to the SNT, whereas the combined IgG and IgM ELISA results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98\u00B73% and 94\u00B74% respectively.

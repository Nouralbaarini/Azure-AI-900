Wearing medical masks or N95 masks (namely N95 respirators) can slow the virus spread and reduce the infection risk. Reuse of these masks can minimize waste, protect the environment, and help to solve the current imminent shortage of masks. Disinfection of used masks is needed for reuse of them with safety, but improper decontamination can damage the blocking structure of masks. In this study, we demonstrated, using avian coronavirus of infectious bronchitis virus to mimic SARS-CoV-2, that medical masks and N95 masks remained their blocking efficacy after being steamed on boiling water even for 2 hours. We also demonstrated that three brands of medical masks blocked over 99% viruses in aerosols. The avian coronavirus was completely inactivated after being steamed for 5 minutes. Together, this study suggested that medical masks are adequate for use on most social occasions, and both medical masks and N95 masks can be reused for a few days with steam decontamination between use.

Overall, maternal body mass index (BMI) and adiposity measurements were associated with higher HM fat and lactose concentrations at different stages of lactation, whereas protein concentration in HM did not appear to differ between overweight and/or obese and normal weight women. However, given the considerable variability in the results between studies and low quality of many of the included studies, further research is needed to establish the impact of maternal overweight and obesity on HM composition.

This poses a challenge for early detection during triage at the emergency department (ED). Over a 3-month period, our ED aimed to minimise nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) METHODS: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 was assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk \u0022fever areas\u0022 and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. RESULTS A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Amongst these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed. The majority (84.2%, 59/70) were picked up at ED triage as they fulfilled suspect case criteria. Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; another 25 were picked up by the broader internal screening criteria. Over the 12-week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3% (95% confidence interval, CI=73.6%-91.9%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6% (95%CI=36.4%- 60.8%). Given the broadened internal criteria, the pre-existing ED \u0022fever area\u0022 was insufficient and had to be expanded. However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance. CONCLUSION Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases. Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimising nosocomial transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wee, Liang En; Fua, Tzay-Ping; Chua, Ying Ying; Ho, Fu Wah Andrew; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Tan, Kenneth Boon-Kiat; Tan, Ban Hock","journal":"Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ED triage","ED facilities","cases of COVID","pre-existing ED","ED admissions","official screening criteria","broader internal screening criteria","specificity of screening criteria","case of COVID","broader suspect case criteria","broadened internal criteria","cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria","intra-ED exposure","cases of nosocomial transmission","surge of suspect cases","disposition of cases","month period","ongoing outbreak of COVID","PPE usage","study period","week period","Usage of appropriate PPE","minimising nosocomial transmission","respiratory syndromes indistinguishable","HCWs","broader criterion","better detection","early detection","fever areas","isolation facilities","extensive surveillance","exposed patients","lower-risk zones","risk-stratified approach","appropriate personal protective equipment","METHODS","healthcare workers","clinical suspicion","emergency department","common viruses","leeway","challenge","CONCLUSION Frontline physicians","confidence interval","total","majority"],"language":"en"},

Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Y-X; Ma, J-R; Wang, S-Q; Zeng, Y-Q; Zhou, C-Y; Ru, Y-H; Zhang, L; Lu, Z-G; Wu, M-H; Li, H","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271454/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["hub targets of MXSGD","protein-protein interaction network","immune response","inflammation-related pathways","active ingredients of MXSGD","underlying mechanism of MXSGD","therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD","threonine-protein kinase","immunomodulation-related pathways","viral infection-related pathways","Heat shock protein","Mitogen-activated protein kinase","acute inflammatory response","clinical treatment of COVID","Vascular endothelial growth factor","Transcription factor AP","Tumour necrosis factor","KEGG enrichment analysis","vascular permeability","pulmonary edema","biological processes","network pharmacology","nCoV infection","Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis","traditional Chinese medicine","pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier","combined therapy of modern medicine","Cellular tumor antigen p53","oxidative stress-induced apoptosis","oxygen radicals","chemokine production","T cell differentiation","RAC-alpha serine","immunoglobulin secretion","Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction","cytokine storm","extracellular matrix disassembly","Wuhan","total","approaches","body","regulation","following effects","basic prescription","coronavirus disease","fever","China"],"language":"en"},

Well water testing is a primary method to identify such risks, although testing rates are generally low. Risk communication is used as an intervention to promote private well testing behavior; however, little is known about whether these efforts are effective as well as the mechanisms that influence effectiveness. A systematic scoping review was conducted to evaluate the current evidence base for risk communication effectiveness and factors that influence well testing behavior. The review was conducted with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. Data were synthesized using a health behavior model (Health Belief Model) to identify areas amenable to intervention and factors to consider when designing risk communication interventions. We identified a significant shortage of studies examining the effectiveness of risk communication interventions targeted to well testing behavior, with only two quasi-experimental studies identified. The review also identified seventeen studies that examined or described factors relating to well testing behavior. The two empirical studies suggest risk communication methods can be successful in motivating private well owners to test their water, while the remaining studies present considerations for developing effective, community-specific content.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colley, Sarah K; Kane, Peter K M; MacDonald Gibson, Jacqueline","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16224333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31703259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["testing behavior","risk communication effectiveness","risk communication methods","effectiveness of risk communication interventions","water testing","testing rates","health behavior model","factors","empirical studies","quasi-experimental studies","systematic scoping review","significant shortage of studies","Systematic Reviews","Scoping Reviews","Health Belief Model","remaining studies present considerations","adverse health effects","Unregulated private wells","Meta-Analyses Extension","Preferred Reporting Items","current evidence base","areas amenable","certain types of contamination","PRISMA-ScR","risks","owners","primary method","community-specific content","framework","mechanisms","Data","efforts"],"language":"en"},

This review maps the extent to which implementation research (IR) has been integrated into HIV research by reviewing the recent funding portfolio of the NIH. We searched NIH RePORTER for HIV and IR-related research projects funded from January 2013 to March 2018. The 4629 unique studies identified were screened using machine learning and manual methods. 216 abstracts met the eligibility criteria of HIV and IR. Key study characteristics were then abstracted. NIH currently funds HIV studies that are either formally IR (n = 109) or preparatory for IR (n = 107). Few (13%) projects mentioned a guiding implementation model, theory, or framework, and only 56% of all studies explicitly mentioned measuring an implementation outcome. Considering the study aims along an IR continuum, 18 (8%) studies examined barriers and facilitators, 43 (20%) developed implementation strategies, 46 (21%) piloted strategies, 73 (34%) tested a single strategy, and 35 (16%) compared strategies. A higher proportion of formal IR projects involved established interventions (e.g., integrated services) compared to newer interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis). Prioritizing HIV-related IR in NIH and other federal funding opportunity announcements and expanded training in implementation science could have a substantial impact on ending the HIV pandemic. This review serves as a baseline by which to compare funding patterns and the sophistication of IR in HIV research over time.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Justin D; Li, Dennis H; Hirschhorn, Lisa R; Gallo, Carlos; McNulty, Moira; Phillips, Gregory; Birkett, Michelle; Rafferty, Miriam; Rao, Amrita; Villamar, Juan A; Baral, Stefan; Mustanski, Brian; Brown, C Hendricks; Benbow, Nanette D","journal":"AIDS and behavior","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-019-02764-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31845078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV research","Prioritizing HIV-related IR","HIV pandemic","HIV Epidemic","implementation research","funds HIV studies","sophistication of IR","IR continuum","implementation strategies","IR-related research projects","eligibility criteria of HIV","new HIV infections","implementation science","implementation outcome","higher proportion of formal IR projects","guiding implementation model","NIH RePORTER","unique studies","behavioral interventions","newer interventions","funding patterns","review","piloted strategies","recent funding portfolio","federal funding opportunity announcements","integrated services","Key study characteristics","expanded training","substantial impact","machine learning","theory","extent","pre-exposure prophylaxis","manual methods","framework","baseline","abstracts","time","barriers","facilitators","challenge","single strategy"],"language":"en"},

This study compared the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with multifocal tumors meeting the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after HR plus intraoperative RFA or HR alone. METHODS A total of 261 consecutive patients with multifocal HCCs meeting the UCSF criteria from January 2010 to January 2018, who underwent combined treatment (n = 51) or HR (n = 210), were included. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for baseline differences. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated, and subgroup analysis, along with univariate and multivariate analyses, were performed. RESULTS The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates after combined treatment or HR alone were 86.3%, 66.6%, and 34.2%, and 92.8%, 67.1%, and 37%, respectively (p = 0.423); combined treatment provided similar RFS rates as HR at 1, 3, and 5 years (78.4%, 35.8% and 20.9% vs. 82.6%, 50.4% and 24.5%, respectively; p = 0.076). The propensity matching model showed similar results. Subgroup analysis showed that HR was associated with better RFS than HR plus RFA for patients with two tumors or major tumors \u2264 3 cm. Multivariate analysis revealed that portal hypertension and three tumors are independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS For multifocal HCC patients meeting the UCSF criteria, combined treatment may offer similar OS and RFS as HR; however, HR may be more suitable than combined treatment for patients with two tumors or major tumors \u2264 3 cm.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yang; Song, Jiulin; Zheng, Jinli; Jiang, Li; Yan, Lunan; Yang, Jiayin; Zeng, Yong; Wu, Hong","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08231-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32016632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFA","University of California San Francisco","HR","UCSF","RFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HR","combined treatment","multifocal tumors","major tumors","treatment of choice","multifocal HCC patients","consecutive patients","multifocal HCCs","UCSF criteria","similar OS","similar RFS rates","better RFS","similar results","Multivariate analysis","subgroup analysis","long-term outcomes of patients","year OS rates","intraoperative RFA","advanced multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas","propensity matching model","Propensity score matching","multivariate analyses","Overall survival","recurrence-free survival","University of California San Francisco","portal hypertension","radiofrequency ablation","independent risk factors","total","hepatic resection","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","matter of debate","study","baseline differences","years"],"language":"en"},

This study focused on active surveillance of several avian viral pathogens with a special reference to AIV in selected backyard duck populations in Bangladesh. A total of 500 pooled oropharyngeal and cloacal samples from individual ducks of four districts were tested by real time PCRs for the presence of AIV, avian avulavirus-1, anatid herpesvirus-1, avian parvovirus, avian bornavirus and avian coronavirus. The investigation identified 27 (5.4%) ducks positive for AIV and 12 (2.4%) for avian coronavirus. In 13 samples, RNA specific for AIV H4N6 was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the AIV hemagglutinin H4 and neuraminidase N6 genes suggested a clustering of Bangladeshi AIV H4N6 in Eurasian lineage group 2. Other AIV positive sample had very low virus loads (Cq \u003E36) and were not subtyped.

From February 2007 to September 2017, we performed 264 CT-guided ablation sessions on 264 lesions in 174 patients (112 M and 62 F; mean age, 68 years; range 36-83 years) affected by primary and metastatic lung lesions. The 45% of patients was affected by primary lung cancer, with size range lesion of 10-50 mm, and the 55% by metastatic lung lesions with size range of 5-49 mm. All patients had no more than three metastases in the lung and pulmonary relapses were treated up to three times. Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Local Progression-Free Survival (LPFS) and Cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 1, 3 and 5 years were calculated both in primary lung tumors and in metastatic patients. Immediate and late RFA-related complications were reported. Pulmonary function tests were evaluated after the procedures. The effectiveness of RFA treatment was evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT. In patients affected by primary lung lesions, the OS rates were 66.73% at 1 year, 23.13% at 3 years and 16.19% at 5 years. In patients affected by metastatic lung lesions, the OS rates were 85.11%, 48.86% and 43.33%, respectively, at 1, 3 and 5 years. PFS at 1, 3 and 5 years were 79.8%, 60.42%, 15.4% in primary lung tumors and 78.59%, 51.8% and 6.07% in metastatic patients. LPFS at 1, 3 and 5 years were 79.8%, 64.69%, 18.87% in primary lung tumors and 86.29%, 69.15% and 44.45% in metastatic patients. CSS at 1, 3 and 5 years was 95.56%, 71.84%, 56.72% in primary lung tumors and 94.07%, 71% and 71% in metastatic patients. Immediate RFA-related complications (pneumothorax, pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema) were observed, respectively, in 42, 53 and 13 of 264 procedures (15.9%, 20% and 5%). There also occurred one major complication (lung abscess, 0.36%). No significant worsening of pulmonary function was noted. Our retrospective evaluation showed long-term effectiveness, safety and imaging features of CT-guided RFA in patients affected by primary and metastatic lung cancer as an alternative therapy in non-surgical candidates.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Picchi, Stefano Giusto; Lassandro, Giulia; Bianco, Andrea; Coppola, Andrea; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Rossi, Umberto G; Lassandro, Francesco","journal":"Medical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01361-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219567/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFA","PFS","LPFS","CSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metastatic patients","primary lung lesions","metastatic lung lesions","years","primary lung tumors","primary lung cancer","metastatic lung cancer","lung abscess","therapy of primary","guided RFA","effectiveness of RFA treatment","Immediate RFA-related complications","Cancer-specific survival","late RFA-related complications","Overall Survival","OS rates","retrospective evaluation of effectiveness","Local Progression-Free Survival","CT-guided ablation sessions","guided radiofrequency ablation","long-term effectiveness","size range lesion","LPFS","pulmonary relapses","Pulmonary function tests","CSS","procedures","significant worsening of pulmonary function","imaging features of CT","non-surgical candidates","alternative therapy","safety of Computed Tomography","pneumothorax","pleural effusion","subcutaneous emphysema","study","mean age","contrast-enhanced","metastases","major complication","aim","times"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 has human-to-human transmission ability and universally contagious to all populations. The main transmission patterns are respiratory droplets transmission and contact transmission. The purpose of this study is to propose a protocol that may be used as a guide to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 infections among otolaryngology care teams. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted to show the efficacy of our protocol to prevent transmission to health-care providers from March 11, 2020 through April 14, 2020. The protocol consisted of a series of protective measures that we applied to all health-care providers, then testing of our providers for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction along with immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing at the end of the study period to ensure effectiveness. RESULTS Our protocol resulted in zero transmissions to our health-care providers during the duration of the initial study. We were involved in greater than 150 sinonasal, skull base, open airway, and endoscopy procedures during this study. At the conclusion of the initial 5 weeks, we had no health-care providers test positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION According to our proposed protocol, we were able to provide care for all patients in clinic, hospital, emergent, intensive, and surgical settings with no transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by symptomatology and post evaluation testing.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taha, Mohamed A; Hall, Christian A; Rathbone, Richard F; Corsten, Luke A; Bowie, Charles R; Waguespack, Paul J; Stanger, Richard; Stevenson, Megan M; Zito, Brittany A; Barham, Henry P","journal":"American journal of rhinology \u0026 allergy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1945892420927178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission of SARS","health-care providers","contact transmission","initial study","human transmission ability","study period","INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV","proposed protocol","respiratory droplets transmission","main transmission patterns","otolaryngology care teams","prospective cohort study","incidence of COVID","conclusion","post evaluation testing","immunoglobulin G","open airway","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","skull base","sinonasal","IgM","clinic","patients","IgG","infections","surgical settings","symptomatology","duration","endoscopy procedures","hospital","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","transmissions","pathogen","series of protective measures","METHODS","weeks","efficacy","populations","guide","effectiveness","Wuhan","China","purpose"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This is a cross-sectional study. We searched in PubMed for SRs published in 2017 in the five infertility journals with the highest impact factor. We analyzed the proportion of SRs published in the top 5 impact factor infertility journals that reported the SRs\u0027 QoE, and the proportion of those SRs in which authors used consistent wording to describe QoE and magnitude of effect. RESULTS The QoE was reported in only 21.4% of the 42 included SRs and in less than 10% of the abstracts. Although we did not find important differences in the report of QoE of those that showed statistically significant differences or not, p value was associated with the wording chosen by the authors. We found inconsistent reporting of the size the effect estimate in 54.8% (23/42) and in the level of QoE in 92.9% (39/42). Whereas the effect size was more consistently expressed in studies with statistically significant findings, QoE was better expressed in those cases in which the p value was over 0.05. CONCLUSION We found that in 2017, less than 25% of the authors reported the overall QoE when publishing SRs. Authors focused more on statistical significance as a binary concept than on methodological limitations like study design, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias. Authors should make efforts to report the QoE and interpret results accordingly.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glujovsky, Demian; Sueldo, Carlos E; Bardach, Ariel; Del Pilar Valanzasca, Mar\u00EDa; Comand\u00E9, Daniel; Ciapponi, Agust\u00EDn","journal":"Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-019-01663-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level of QoE","report of QoE","SRs\u0027 QoE","overall QoE","proportion of SRs","included SRs","impact factor infertility journals","authors of published systematic reviews","effect size","highest impact factor","consistent wording","significant differences","p value","magnitude of effect","appropriate wording","results","study design","cross-sectional study","significant findings","level of quality","important differences","indirectness","imprecision","methodological limitations","binary concept","inconsistency","statistical significance","studies","publication bias","inconsistent reporting","evidence","cases","METHODS","efforts","PubMed","PURPOSE","abstracts","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942.

The Lombardy region faced firstly this outbreak in Italy and recorded rapidly a saturation of intensive care and internal medicine beds. Consequently, this lack of technical and human resources, together with people mobility restriction to contain virus spreading, determined the interruption of elective surgical and interventional cardiovascular procedures. In addition, the emergency track of acute patients has been rewritten due to limited resources and viral co-infection (pre- or in-hospital). Herein, we describe two cases of acute coronary syndrome with severe coronary artery disease and an indication for coronary artery bypass grafting. The first patient, COVID-19 positive, was treated with transcatheter technique due to symptom instability and underwent temporary circulatory support without intubation. The second patient received an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then transferred, in accordance with government emergency provisions, to a hub hospital to undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and short intensive care unit stay.

Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is \u0027physical distancing\u0027 in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk \u0027allowances\u0027 or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic\u0027s trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic\u0027s potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chersich, Matthew F; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie, Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah; Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona; Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen","journal":"Globalization and health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00574-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Telemedicine"],"locations":["China","Africa"],"keyphrases":["support healthcare workers","commitment of healthcare workers","ill healthcare workers","community healthcare workers","Prioritizing healthcare workers","Africa","patients","continent","International support","human resources","supplies of personal protective equipment","limited critical care beds","physical distancing","key resources","effective COVID","related interventions","low-cost interventions","SARS-CoV","urban care centres","physical exhaustion","hospital beds","national commitment","social distancing","water supplies","HIV counselors","HIV control","pandemic\u0027s trajectory","Staff motivation","Medical staff","overcrowded primary health care clinics","difficulties","family","separation","testing","mental stress","mortality","symptom screening","myths","devastating heath","families","security impacts","patient contact","cough","response capacity","invaluable lessons","Ebola","population","authoritative voice","multiple ways","stigma","targeted research","policies","prioritization","pain","facemasks","China","personnel","managed risk","major gaps","trace contacts","Global jostling","Medline","Pubmed","allowances\u0027","compensation","infection risks","retention","handwashing","articles","adequate protection","public figures","safety","colleagues","challenges","morale","Telemedicine"],"language":"en"},

Both guidelines recommend adapting management for older patients with complex health conditions, without however clear indications on how to adapt. Our aims were to assess the impact of lowering BP thresholds on the prevalence of elevated BP and BP control, as well as the proportion of participants with a complex health condition across these BP categories. We used data from 3210 participants in the Lausanne cohort Lc65\u002B aged between 67 and 80 years. Hypertension diagnosis and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. BP was measured three times at one visit. Some 51% of participants reported having hypertension and 44% reported taking antihypertensive medication. Compared with ESC/ESH thresholds, the prevalence of measured elevated BP was 24% percentage points higher and BP control was 24% percentage points lower using ACC/AHA thresholds. About one out of two participants with elevated BP and four out of five participants with uncontrolled BP had a complex health condition, i.e., frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy. To comply with ACC/AHA guidelines, considerable effort would be required to reach BP control. This is a serious challenge because a large share of hypertensive older adults has complex health conditions, a type of patients for whom there is no strong evidence on how to manage hypertension.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anker, Daniela; Santos-Eggimann, Brigitte; Zwahlen, Marcel; Santschi, Val\u00E9rie; Rodondi, Nicolas; Wolfson, Christina; Chiolero, Arnaud","journal":"Journal of human hypertension","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41371-020-0334-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["American Heart Association","ACC/AHA","BP","European Society of Cardiology"],"locations":["Lausanne"],"keyphrases":["BP control","uncontrolled BP","BP categories","prevalence of elevated BP","prevalence of measured elevated BP","impact of lowering BP thresholds","guidelines","Hypertension diagnosis","complex health conditions","European Society of Hypertension","ESH thresholds","ACC","proportion of participants","hypertension management lowered blood pressure","older patients","European Society of Cardiology","ESC","mmHg","percentage points higher","American College of Cardiology","antihypertensive medication use","adapting management","type of patients","American Heart Association","large share of hypertensive older adults","frailty","serious challenge","clear indications","considerable effort","Lausanne cohort Lc65","multimorbidity","strong evidence","polypharmacy","data","times","visit","aims","years"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the CT image data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and CT examination in 57 patients in Zhuzhou Central Hospital and Zhuzhou First People\u0027s Hospital, and summarized the characteristics of CT imaging and the development of lesions. RESULTS Most of the cases were characterized by peripheral distribution of lesions. A total of 37 cases (64.91%) were purely peripherally distributed, 16 cases (28.07%) coexisted with peripheral and mid-internal distribution, and 4 cases (7.02%) had simple mid-inner band distribution. In peripherally distributed cases, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel to the pleura in 36 cases (63.16%). In the case of inner-middle zone distribution, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel and surrounded the bronchial vascular bundle, or distributed along the lung lobules (31.58%). All cases had ground-glass-density foci, 31 cases (54.38%) had fine grid shadows in the lesions, 46 cases (80.70%) had thick vascular shadows in the lesions, and 23 cases (40.35%) showed signs of bronchial inflation. Among the 10 cases of \u0022wrinkling shape\u0022 lesions in the first CT examination, except for 1 case without reexamination, the remaining 9 cases had different degrees of absorption in the second CT examination. Among the 26 cases of \u0022wrinkling shape\u0022 lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination. CONCLUSIONS The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule. As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion. When the lesions show a \u0022wrinkling shape\u0022, it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption. These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ming; Peng, Wanxiang; Chen, Miaomiao; Zhu, Qichao; Zou, Xia; Long, Xiaoli","journal":"Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and \u03B1-ketoamide-11r were performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) of potential energy components of MD discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and \u03B1-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R2 value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. Our proposed MLR model can predict the favorable binding energy compared with the binding energy detected from molecular docking. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show that these selected phytochemicals can be used as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Islam, Rajib; Parves, Rimon; Paul, Archi Sundar; Uddin, Nizam; Rahman, Md Sajjadur; Mamun, Abdulla Al; Hossain, Md Nayeem; Ali, Md Ackas; Halim, Mohammad A","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1761883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCA","QSAR","MLR","ADMET"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["main protease of SARS","potential inhibitors","Molecular docking","selected phytochemicals","selected candidates","antiviral phytochemicals","best candidates","docking interactions","potent inhibitors","safer inhibitors","favorable binding energy","QSAR","binding affinities","potential energy components of MD","baicalin","statistical analysis","root","\u03B1-ketoamide","glucoside","cyanidin","ADMET analysis","PCA","SARS-CoV","ns molecular dynamics","Principal component analysis","square fluctuation","square deviation","training set","best ligands","test set","antiviral drugs","proposed MLR model","solvent accessible surface area","pattern recognition","apo-form","SASA","GOLD suite","structural similarity","AutoDock Vina","quantitative structure-activity relationship","radius of gyration","key Cys145","investigations","RMSF","R2 value","simulations","glabridin","Multiple linear regression","His41 residues","RMSD","hypericin","important targets","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Because it has only been studied for just over three months, there is still an incomplete understanding of the disease, in particular its sequelae and long-term outcomes. As well, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs for patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. Therefore, the objective of this report was to answer the question \u0022What rehabilitation do survivors of COVID-19 require?\u0022. The question was stated within the context of a sub-acute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients might present have been summarized: comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay \u002B/- intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including cardiac, neurological, cognition, and mental health. Second, suggested procedures regarding design of an inpatient rehabilitation unit for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation have been made. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been made, with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as mobility and function. A thorough assessment and individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life. Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients have the most complete recovery possible.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheehy, Lisa Mary","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rehabilitation environment","inpatient rehabilitation unit","survivors of COVID","outpatient rehabilitation services","function","patients","acute care","question","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","sub-acute hospital","intensive care unit","UNSTRUCTURED Coronavirus disease","geriatric inpatient","respiratory system","complete recovery possible","occupational therapy","progressive treatment plan","multiple body systems","staffing issues","speech-language pathology","physiotherapy","design","considerations","infection","thorough assessment","cognition","effects","sequelae","complications","context","discharge","suggested procedures","participation","long-term outcomes","mental health","incomplete understanding","comorbidities","disability","intubation","respect","Careful consideration","mobility","guidelines","areas relevant","quality of life","society","report","objective","months","details"],"language":"en"},

DEB is associated with higher HbA1c levels and increased risk of developing complications to T1D. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DEB in a Danish cohort of children and adolescents with T1D aged 11-19 years and to characterize them regarding metabolic control and relevant clinical data. RESEARCH DESIGN \u0026 METHODS In a cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of DEB using the revised Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS-R) questionnaire. HbA1c and relevant clinical data were obtained at the time they filled in the questionnaire. RESULTS 192 children and adolescents (46% girls) aged 11-19 years with T1D were included from the pediatric diabetes outpatient clinic. A total of 40 participants (21%) had DEB. The prevalence was higher amongst girls compared with boys (34.1% vs 8.9%) and those who had DEB were older (16.7 vs 15.0 years, P \u003C 0.001), had longer duration of T1D (7.5 vs 4.9 years, P \u003C 0.001), higher BMI Z-scores (1.2 vs 0.3, P \u003C 0.001), higher HbA1c (72.8 (8.8%) vs 62.0 (7.8%) mmol/mol, P \u003C 0.001), higher total cholesterol (4.6 mmoL/L vs 4.2 mmoL/L, P = 0.0048) and LDL (2.7 vs 2.3, P = 0.001) compared with those with no signs of DEB. CONCLUSION As in other countries, the prevalence of DEB is high in Danish adolescents with T1D. Early detection of DEB is essential to prevent short- and long-term complications to T1D.

Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahu, Kamal Kant; Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos","journal":"Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV infection","cases of Coronavirus disease","human SARS virus","Ebola virus disease","bat-SL","confirmed cases","treatment of COVID","epidemiological link of nCoV","Genomic characterization nCoV","Marburg virus infections","discovered coronavirus","previous coronavirus outbreaks","pandemic disease","current outbreak","Suspected cases","clear infection","fear of novel corona virus","current viral outbreak","standard infection control techniques","receptor protein","MERS outbreaks","bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome","receptor binding site","preventive steps","healthy individuals","supportive care","overall mortality rate","close homology","best available strategy","CoVZC45","modes of transmission","hosts","coronaviruses","ACE","order","international level","genomics","Structural analysis","benefit","test","passing day","Constant efforts","genome sequence","regards","CoVZXC21","antiviral agents","vaccines","knowledge","present","effectiveness","phase","Remdesivir"],"language":"en"},

Among these modern vaccine technologies are the recombinant viral vectored vaccines, which are known for their incredible specificity in antigen delivery as well as the induction of robust immune responses in the vaccinated hosts.

Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures. In particular, the proposed method demonstrated a high Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.52, F-score of 0.49, and Youden\u0027s index of 0.81 on an independent test dataset, thereby outperforming the existing methods for AFP prediction.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Usman, Muhammad; Khan, Shujaat; Lee, Jeong-A","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63259-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction methods","proposed method","AFP prediction","existing methods","machine-learning methods","deep auto-encoder method","classification of AFPs","Diverse AFPs","accurate prediction","prediction of AFP sequences","latent space learning","novel machine-learning","antifreeze proteins","latent space pruning","low sequence","PSI-BLAST","essential proteins","antifreeze glycoproteins","protein sequence descriptor","deep neural network classifier","non-linear mapping","sub-zero temperatures","based approach","numerous applications","freezing conditions","high Matthews correlation coefficient","various organisms","structural similarity","cold environments","sub-types","F-score","AFGPs","class label","independent test dataset","different industries","excellent results","output","terms","simple search algorithms","Youden\u0027s index","greater reliability","fishes","comparison","comprehensive ablation study","performance measures","Species","paper","small resemblance"],"language":"en"},

No differences between indacaterol and placebo were observed in the whole population except for a significantly higher VE/VCO2 slope and lower maximal PETCO2 during exercise with indacaterol, entirely due to the difference in the bisoprolol group (VE/VCO2 31.8 \u00B1 5.9 vs. 28.5 \u00B1 5.6, p \u003C 0.0001 and maximal PETCO2 36.7 \u00B1 5.5 vs. 37.7 \u00B1 5.8 mmHg, p \u003C 0.02 with indacaterol and placebo, respectively). In carvedilol, indacaterol was associated with a higher peak heart rate (119 \u00B1 34 vs. 113 \u00B1 30 bpm, with indacaterol and placebo) and a lower prevalence of hypopnea during sleep (3.8 [0.0;6.3] vs. 5.8 [2.9;10.5] events/hour, with indacaterol and placebo). Inhaled indacaterol is well tolerated in HF patients, it does not influence lung diffusion, and, in bisoprolol, it increases ventilation response to exercise.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Contini, Mauro; Spadafora, Emanuele; Barbieri, Simone; Gugliandolo, Paola; Salvioni, Elisabetta; Magini, Alessandra; Apostolo, Anna; Palermo, Pietro; Alimento, Marina; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62644-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of indacaterol","Inhaled indacaterol","lung diffusion","HF patients","placebo treatments","carvedilol","lung mechanics","bisoprolol group","lower maximal PETCO2","higher VE","exercise performance","sleep","alveolar \u03B22-receptors","VCO2 slope","heart failure","Alveolar \u03B22-receptor blockade","higher peak heart rate","lower prevalence of hypopnea","welfare","respiratory behavior","cardiac rhythm","\u03B2-blocker","ventilation response","population","hour","double-blind protocol","events","safety","mmHg","differences","bpm","Study procedures"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients\u0027 WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results. In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gebbia, Vittorio; Piazza, Dario; Valerio, Maria Rosaria; Borsellino, Nicol\u00F2; Firenze, Alberto","journal":"JCO global oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WhatsApp","Association of Medical Oncology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["queries","WhatsApp instant messaging system","breast cancer","oncology units","pancreatic cancer","COVID","Italian Association of Medical Oncology","different patients\u0027 WhatsApp conversations","medical settings","Delay requirements","social scenario","pandemic scenario","controversial results","uncontrolled treatment delays","requirement of visit delay","immunotherapy administration","hospitals","withdrawal","changes","possible immunosuppression","follow-up","oral therapies","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","stage of disease","nationwide lockdown","behavioral mistakes","pharmacies","lifestyle","Italy","fears","chemotherapy","knowledge","primary tumor","subsequent phone calls","lung","prostate","recommendations","rapid answer","descriptive investigation","current treatments","site","food supplies","daily activities","panic","following","data","PURPOSE","homology","Analysis","CONCLUSION","Actions","oncologists","categories","experience","Responses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This increase is most probably related to the obesity pandemic and the high consumption of fructose. However, hepatic steatosis has some rare causes (e.g., some metabolic diseases) of which clinicians should be aware, particularly (but not only) when patients are non-obese or non-overweight. Differential diagnosis is notably important when pathologies have a specific treatment, such as for glycogenosis type IX (GSD-IX). Aims To contribute to the knowledge on the differential diagnosis of NAFLD in paediatric age and to the clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological characterisations of GSD-IX, a rare metabolic disorder. Methods We performed a retrospective study of a small series of cases (n = 3) of GSD-IX diagnosed in the past 6 years, who were currently being followed up in the Units of Gastroenterology or Metabolic Diseases of the Paediatric Division of our hospital and whose clinical presentation was NAFLD in paediatric age. Results Three male patients were diagnosed with NAFLD before 2 years of age, 2 with confirmed diagnosis before the age of 3 years (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], liver ultrasound, and molecular analysis) and 1 whose diagnosis was confirmed at 11 years (ALT, liver ultrasound, liver histology, and molecular analysis). None of the patients were obese or overweight, and the daily fructose consumption was unknown. The outcome was favourable in all 3 patients, with follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 6 years. Conclusion The decision on how far the search for secondary causes of NAFLD should go can be difficult, and GSD-IX must be on the list of possible causes.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leuzinger Dias, Catarina; Maio, In\u00EAs; Brand\u00E3o, Jos\u00E9 Ricardo; Tom\u00E1s, Edite; Martins, Esmeralda; Santos Silva, Ermelinda","journal":"GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000496571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31832499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAFLD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years of age","differential diagnosis of NAFLD","paediatric age","recent years","liver ultrasound","secondary causes of NAFLD","confirmed diagnosis","liver histology","metabolic diseases","molecular analysis","rare causes","male patients","ALT","Paediatric Division","rare metabolic disorder","histological characterisations of GSD","daily fructose consumption","high consumption of fructose","list of possible causes","prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","clinical presentation","alanine aminotransferase","pathologies","hospital","small series of cases","retrospective study","specific treatment","search","children","adolescents","obesity pandemic","glycogenosis type","Units of Gastroenterology","clinicians","hepatic steatosis","knowledge","follow-up periods","decision","Methods","outcome","Results","Conclusion","increase"],"language":"en"},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carfilzomib-based with non-carfilzomib-based regimens in MM to investigate the risk of kidney toxicity. Point estimates were pooled in the form of risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. We identified four RCTs with 2954 patients. The median duration of treatment ranged from 16.3 to 88 weeks in carfilzomib arms. The cumulative rate of kidney toxicities in the carfilzomib arms was 21.3% for all grades and 8.3% for grades 3-5 toxicities, with acute kidney injury being the predominantly reported event. Patients receiving a carfilzomib-based regimen had a significantly higher risk of total kidney toxicity compared with those in the control arms, with pooled RR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.43-2.23, p \u003C 0.001) and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.59-3.30; p \u003C 0.001), for all grades and grades 3-5 toxicities, respectively.

Subgroup analysis based on carfilzomib dose, infusion length, and treatment setting did not identify any significant subgroup effect. Kidney toxicity is an important adverse effect of carfilzomib-based regimens.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in COVID-19 (Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well-established.(1) This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy from Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a Phase 2/3 study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination. This paper may also serve to facilitate the consideration and use of a priori-defined control groups for future research.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damle, Bharat; Vourvahis, Manoli; Wang, Erjian; Leaney, Joanne; Corrigan, Brian","journal":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AZ"],"locations":["AZ"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of AZ","administration of AZ","AZ therapy","characteristics of AZ","clinical trials of AZ","safety profile of AZ","clinical studies","treatment of COVID","clinical pharmacology","Phase","combination","randomized clinical evidence","initiating COVID","treatment of respiratory","treatment of viral infections","planning","safety data","healthy volunteer studies","pediatric patients","antibacterial agent","safe study conduct","genitourinary bacterial infections","basic CP information relevant","long half-life","broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic","probability","HCQ","uncomplicated malaria","defined control groups","future research","agents","definitive answers","hydroxychloroquine","large volume of distribution","Coronavirus Infectious Disease","hospitals","antiviral properties","anecdotal reports","Azithromycin","consideration","paper"],"language":"en"},

The Contour Neurovascular System embolization device is a novel tool for the treatment of such intracranial aneurysms. We report on our experience with this device. METHODS Prospective clinical and radiological data were collected for all patients treated with the Contour device at our center. All our patients were treated on an elective basis. RESULTS We have treated 11 patients successfully with the Contour device to date. All patients were women with a mean (SD) age of 65.0 (6.4) years. In total, four basilar tip, two internal carotid artery, three middle cerebral artery, one anterior communicating artery, and one superior cerebellar artery aneurysms were treated. At 1-year follow-up, complete occlusion (Raymond Class 1) was seen in 55.56% (5/9) of cases, with 44.44% (4/9) having small neck remnants (Raymond Class 2). One patient declined 1-year catheter angiography and another had no further follow-up due to an unrelated medical condition. For six patients, 2-year radiological follow-up is available and shows stability. At 6 weeks, nine of the 11 patients had a modifed Rankin Scale score of 0, with two patients scoring 1 for headaches. Two patients had thromboembolic events, but there were no complications leading to permanent neurological disability or death. We additionally had three patients where the Contour device was attempted but was unable to be successfully used. CONCLUSION Initial results are promising although larger case numbers and longer follow-up are necessary to draw further conclusions on the utility and risk profile of this new device.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akhunbay-Fudge, Christopher Yusuf; Deniz, Kenan; Tyagi, Atul Kumar; Patankar, Tufail","journal":"Journal of neurointerventional surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31974281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","Contour device","year follow-up","new device","year radiological follow-up","Contour Neurovascular System embolization device","longer follow-up","superior cerebellar artery aneurysms","middle cerebral artery","internal carotid artery","anterior communicating artery","Raymond Class","intracranial aneurysms","year catheter angiography","radiological data","PURPOSE Wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms","CONCLUSION Initial results","larger case numbers","significant challenge","novel tool","conclusions","basilar tip","risk profile","complete occlusion","modifed Rankin Scale score","permanent neurological disability","complications","utility","BACKGROUND","METHODS Prospective clinical","treatment","small neck remnants","mean","age","SD","death","treating clinician","unrelated medical condition","women","stability","thromboembolic events","total","elective basis","center","date","years","experience","weeks","headaches","cases"],"language":"en"},

Patient communication strategies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and voice restorative devices are recommended to facilitate communication. These strategies, however, are inconsistently adopted in ICU practice signaling utilization barriers. Our objective is to map and synthesize the current evidence-base for stakeholder-reported barriers and facilitators to patient communication strategy utilization for adults with an advanced airway in the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Arskey and O\u0027Malley\u0027s recommended methods to conduct a scoping review using a rapid review framework to streamline the process. A single reviewer will conduct a search and an initial screen of titles and abstracts from five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and PsychInfo) from 1990 to present to identify English language peer-reviewed studies. Subsequently, two reviewers will independently screen a shorter list of studies for inclusion. We will also search the reference lists of eligible studies. Two reviewers will independently extract study characteristics, communication strategy, and stakeholder reported barriers and facilitators. We will code and categorize the extracted barriers and facilitators according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), an integrative framework of behavior change. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map and synthesize reported barriers and facilitators to communication strategy utilization in the adult ICU using a theoretical framework. The results of this scoping review will help to identify trends and gaps in the current evidence-base and support recommendations for improving patient-centered practice, policy, and research related to successfully establishing ICU patient communication.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Istanboulian, Laura; Rose, Louise; Yunusova, Yana; Gorospe, Franklin; Dale, Craig","journal":"Systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1232-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31810494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Allied Health Literature"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU patient communication","Patient communication strategies","patient communication strategy utilization","alternative communication","utilization barriers","facilitators","reported barriers","ICU practice","scoping review","adult ICU","rapid review framework","theoretical framework","extracted barriers","experience profound communication impairment","patient-centered practice","Theoretical Domains Framework","stakeholder","current evidence-base","reviewers","integrative framework of behavior change","shorter list of studies","O\u0027Malley\u0027s recommended methods","reference lists of eligible studies","English language peer-reviewed studies","initial screen of titles","Nursing","intensive care unit","Cumulative Index","support recommendations","MEDLINE","EMBASE","Allied Health Literature","Cochrane Library","abstracts","risk","AAC","adults","CINAHL","electronic databases","ventilated patients","Arskey","TDF","research","trends","voice restorative devices","advanced airway","study characteristics","psychological outcomes","policy","gaps","PsychInfo","BACKGROUND","ANALYSIS","inclusion","process","single reviewer","results","DISCUSSION","knowledge","objective"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We present a series of seven cases of awareness that were identified from provider-reported adverse event data from the electronic anesthesia records of 647,000 general anesthetics. RESULTS The low number of identified cases suggests an under-reporting bias. Themes that emerge from this small series can serve as important reminders to anesthesia providers to ensure delivery of an adequate anesthetic for each patient. Commonalities between a majority of our identified anesthetic awareness cases include: obesity, use of total intravenous anesthesia, use of neuromuscular blockade, and either a lack of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring or documented high depth of consciousness index values. An interesting phenomenon was observed in one case, where adequately-dosed anesthesia was delivered without technical issue, processed EEG monitoring was employed, and the index value suggested an adequate depth of consciousness throughout the case. CONCLUSIONS Provider-reported adverse event data in the immediate post-operative period are likely insensitive for detecting cases of intraoperative awareness. Though causation cannot firmly be established from our data, themes identified in this series of cases of awareness with recall under general anesthesia provide important reminders for anesthesia providers to maintain vigilance in monitoring depth and dose of anesthesia, particularly with total intravenous anesthesia.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deis, Amanda S; Schnetz, Michael P; Ibinson, James W; Vogt, Keith M","journal":"BMC anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-00974-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["general anesthesia","anesthesia providers","dose of anesthesia","dosed anesthesia","cases of awareness","total intravenous anesthesia","series of cases","identified anesthetic awareness cases","electronic anesthesia records","cases of intraoperative awareness","monitoring depth","BACKGROUND Awareness","low number of identified cases","important reminders","important issue","adverse event data","processed EEG monitoring","adequate depth of consciousness","recall","general anesthetics","adequate anesthetic","small series","Themes","high depth of consciousness index values","technical issue","CONCLUSIONS Provider","lack of processed electroencephalogram","immediate post-operative period","obesity","vigilance","delivery","majority","neuromuscular blockade","under-reporting bias","interesting phenomenon","Commonalities","patient","study","METHODS","causation"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesize that there are associations between preoperative seizures and morphologic features (e.g., tumor size, location) and histogram features in patients with glioblastoma (GB). Methods: Retrospectively, 160 consecutive patients with initial diagnosis and surgery of GB (WHO IV) and preoperative MRI were analyzed. Preoperative MRI sequences were co-registered (T2-FLAIR, T1-contrast, DTI) and tumors were segmented by a neuroradiologist using the software ITK-snap blinded to the clinical data. Tumor volume (FLAIR, T1-contrast) and histogram analyses of ADC- and FA-maps were recorded in the contrast enhancing tumor part (CET) and the non-enhancing peritumoral edema (FLAIR). Location was determined after co-registration of the data with an atlas. Permutation-based multiple-testing adjusted t statistics were calculated to compare imaging variables between patients with and without seizures. Results: Patients with seizures showed significantly smaller tumors (CET, adj. p = 0.029) than patients without preoperative seizures. Less seizures were observed in patients with tumor location in the right cingulate gyrus (adj. p = 0.048) and in the right caudate nucleus (adj. p = 0.009). Significant differences of histogram analyses of FA in the contrast enhancing tumor part were observed between patients with and without seizures considering also tumor location and size. Conclusion: Preoperative seizures in GB patients are associated with lower preoperative tumor volume. The different histogram analyses suggest that there might be microstructural differences in the contrast enhancing tumor part of patients with seizures measured by fractional anisotropy. Higher variance of GB presenting without seizures might indicate a more aggressive growth of these tumors.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bette, Stefanie; Barz, Melanie; Ly Nham, Huong; Huber, Thomas; Berndt, Maria; Sales, Arthur; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Meyer, Hanno S; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S; Wiestler, Benedikt; Gempt, Jens","journal":"Cancers","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12040994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preoperative seizures","GB patients","tumor location","consecutive patients","tumor growth","tumor size","tumor manifestation","lower preoperative tumor volume","low-grade glioma patients","T1-contrast","histogram features","Preoperative MRI sequences","histogram analyses of ADC","different histogram analyses","surgery of GB","Significant differences of histogram analyses of FA","T2-FLAIR","CET","smaller tumors","Higher variance of GB","non-enhancing peritumoral edema","morphologic features","co-registration","FA-maps","aggressive growth","microstructural differences","clinical data","right cingulate gyrus","right caudate nucleus","initial diagnosis","adjusted t statistics","software ITK-snap","neuroradiologist","imaging variables","DTI","associations","glioblastoma","Conclusion","fractional anisotropy","Purpose","Permutation","atlas","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and divided into 7 groups according to the treatment option. Information including age, gender and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. The chest CT imaging obtained at admission and after a 5-d treatment cycle were assessed. The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed. At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms and main laboratory results. No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P=0.151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P=0.116). At discharge, 7/184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leucocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission. According to the results, the inclusion of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regimens based on symptomatic treatment had no significant additional impact on the improvement in COVID-19 patients.

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Givi, Babak; Schiff, Bradley A; Chinn, Steven B; Clayburgh, Daniel; Iyer, N Gopalakrishna; Jalisi, Scharukh; Moore, Michael G; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Orloff, Lisa A; O\u0027Neill, James P; Parker, Noah; Zender, Chad; Morris, Luc G T; Davies, Louise","journal":"JAMA otolaryngology-- head \u0026 neck surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Relevance"],"locations":["China","Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["care of patients","infection of health care workers","high number of health care workers","skilled health care workforce","experience of health care systems","high levels of care","course of patient care","Specific safety recommendations","COVID","high levels of safety","set of safety recommendations","strict safety guidelines","strict safety precautions","pandemic","Specific recommendations","firsthand knowledge of safety procedures","potential risk","provided recommendations","added risk of exposure","therapeutic procedures","Physicians","common procedures","literature","novel coronavirus disease","treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases","respiratory droplets","medical community","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Europe","close contact","examination","regions","Asia","priority","communications","otolaryngologists-head","broad guidance","neck surgeons","Relevance","Observations","tracheostomy","city of Wuhan","rapid spread","consensus best practices","unprecedented degree","Importance","review","phase","China","Conclusions","time","category"],"language":"en"},

This case report presents an unexpected cause of biliopancreatic limb obstruction and the importance of prompt intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS A 37-year-old woman presented with complaints of weight regain (BMI increased from 27 to 33.3 kg/m2) and bile reflux and was found to have marginal ulcers on endoscopy. She had undergone loop gastric bypass with Braun anastomosis in 2009 at another center for morbid obesity (BMI = 43 kg/m2). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was created after the separation of gastro-jejunostomy (GJ) and jejuno-jejunostomy (JJ). On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was readmitted with signs of peritonitis. Urgent relaparoscopy showed Biliopancreatic limb (BP) obstruction. It was then and that we understood intraoperatively the uncut Roux-en-Y caused stricture between the previous GJ and JJ staple lines.

The release of phenolic compounds from the food matrix during digestion is an important pre-requisite for their effectiveness within the human body, so it is fundamental to identify technological treatments able to preserve not only the concentration of phytochemicals but also their bioaccessibility. In this study we investigated the impact of high-pressure homogenization (HPH), alone and in the presence of 100 g kg-1 trehalose or Lactobacillus salivarius, on bioaccessibility of flavonoids in mandarin juice. In addition, digested mandarin juices were supplemented to liver cultured cells in basal and stressed condition to evaluate their protective effect in a biological system. RESULTS HPH reduced the concentration of total phenolics and main flavonoids but increased their bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion (p \u003C 0.001). In basal condition, supplementation with all digested juices significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration (p \u003C 0.001). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in the medium was also reduced by supplementation with HPH-treated juices. Although pre-treatment with juices did not completely counteract the applied oxidative stress it preserved cell viability, and cells pre-treated with juices submitted to HPH in the presence of probiotics showed the lowest ROS concentration. CONCLUSION Our study represents an important step ahead in the evaluation of the impact of processing on the nutritional and functional value of food, which cannot simply be assessed based on chemical composition.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells binding to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme responsible of the cleavage of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, which has vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effects. Virus-mediated downregulation of ACE2 may increase angiotensin II stimulation and contribute to the deleterious hyper-inflammatory reaction of COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2 may be upregulated in patients with cardiac disease and treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE2 upregulation may increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 but may be also protective versus angiotensin II mediated vasoconstriction and inflammatory activation. Recent data show the lack of untoward effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for COVID-19 infection and severity. Prospective trials are needed to ascertain whether these drugs may have protective effects. This article is protected by copyright.

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm \u00B1 1.99 and 0.94 \u00B1 0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1% \u00B1 0.115 and 98.5% \u00B1 0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3% \u00B1 0.110 and 96.1% \u00B1 0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8% \u00B1 0.09 and 14% \u00B1 0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Guoping; Udupa, Jayaram K; Tong, Yubing; Odhner, Dewey; Cao, Hanqiang; Torigian, Drew A","journal":"Medical physics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LN","DQ","AAR","CT","SVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AAR-LN","pathologic LNs","automatic recognition of LN zones","LN zone recognition","LN recognition strategy","AAR localized LN zones","localization of LNs","thoracic LN zones","lymph node zone recognition","Recognizing lymph node zones","specificity of pathologic LN recognition","pathologic LN localization","identified LNs","abnormal lymph node localization","recognized abnormal LNs","Building lymph node zones models","localized zones","task of disease quantification","abnormal PET","g-filter","recognized zones","built lymph node models","novel globular filter","CT images","general globular shape of LNs","SVM method","SegNet method","CONCLUSIONS Accurate disease quantification","feasible following lymph node zone","explicit delineation of lymph nodes","pathologic nodes","normal CT data sets","gradation of disease content","CT acquisitions","degree of disease burden","fuzzy disease map","SVM strategy","detection of malignant lymph nodes","automatic anatomy recognition","DQ methodology","high recognition rates","multi-level SVM classifier","novel approach","DQ methods","best SegNet strategy","method of evaluation","normal patient data sets","globular nature","contrast-enhanced CT examinations","voxel level","novel aspects of model building","explicit nodal delineation","explicit nodal segmentation","deep neural network","PET partial volume effects","medical images","lymphoma patients","general shape information","traditional classifier","specificity of deep networks","thorax","use","derivation of quantitative information","computed tomography","quantitative radiology","level support vector machine","main steps","main processes","positron emission tomography","image segmentation challenges","practical manner","sensitivity","uncertain phenomena","uncertainty","paper","conjunction","cross validation","stations","mean absolute percent errors","QR","optimal hierarchy","organs","major hurdle","scale error","regions","PURPOSE","goal","clinical reality","accuracy","estimating disease burden","disease map concept","LNs","various uncertainties"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 66793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until April 8, 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (p\u003C0.001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; p=0.60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.

Folliculo-stellate cells do not produce anterior pituitary hormones but they are thought to play important roles as stem cells, phagocytes, or supporting cells of hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. S100\u03B2 protein has been used as a folliculo-stellate cell marker in some animals, including rats. However, since no reliable molecular marker for folliculo-stellate cells has been reported in mice, genetic approaches for the investigation of folliculo-stellate cells in mice are not yet available. Aldolase C/Zebrin II is a brain-type isozyme and is a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. In the present study, we first used immunohistochemistry to verify that aldolase C was produced in the anterior pituitary of rats. Moreover, using transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the S100\u03B2 gene promoter, we identified aldolase C-immunoreactive signals in folliculo-stellate cells and marginal cells located in the parenchyma of the anterior pituitary and around Rathke\u0027s cleft, respectively. We also identified aldolase C-expressing cells in the mouse pituitary using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Aldolase C was not produced in any pituitary hormone-producing cells, while aldolase C-immunopositive signal co-localized with E-cadherin- and SOX2-positive cells. Using post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy, aldolase C-immunoreactive products were observed in the cytoplasm of marginal cells and folliculo-stellate cells of the mouse pituitary. Taken together, aldolase C is a common folliculo-stellate cell marker in the anterior pituitary gland of rodents.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujiwara, Ken; Tsukada, Takehiro; Horiguchi, Kotaro; Fujiwara, Yoko; Takemoto, Konomi; Nio-Kobayashi, Junko; Ohno, Nobuhiko; Inoue, Kinji","journal":"Cell and tissue research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03200-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Aldolase C/Zebrin II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["folliculo-stellate cells","cells of hormone","stem cells","cytoplasm of marginal cells","anterior pituitary of rats","SOX2-positive cells","mouse pituitary","anterior pituitary hormones","aldolase C-immunoreactive signals","aldolase C-immunoreactive products","bisphosphate aldolase","investigation of folliculo","anterior pituitary gland of rodents","common folliculo-stellate cell marker","aldolase C-immunopositive signal co-localized","mice","used immunohistochemistry","S100\u03B2 protein","types of hormone","transgenic rats","reliable molecular marker","green fluorescent protein","S100\u03B2 gene promoter","E-cadherin","control","phagocytes","post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy","fructose","important roles","genetic approaches","Zebrin","animals","brain-type isozyme","parenchyma","situ hybridization","present study","Rathke\u0027s cleft"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS Our retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Between January 2006 and December 2013, 290 patients (82 women, 208 men; mean age, 64.5 years; range, 33-89 years) with 474 subcapsular (within 1 cm to the liver surface) HCCs (mean size, 23.7 mm; range, 6-71 mm) underwent percutaneous thermal ablation. The HCCs were divided into surface contact group (n = 243) and non-surface contact group (n = 231). The former was further subdivided into exophytic and non-exophytic HCCs. Technical success, primary technique efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), and secondary technique efficacy rates were analyzed and compared by the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Prognostic factors for LTP and secondary technique efficacy were assessed using the Cox regression model. Major complications were also assessed. RESULTS With median follow-up of 15 months (range, 1-87 months), technical success and primary technique efficacy were 98.7% and 95.7% % in the non-surface contact group; 96.4% and 94.0% in the non-exophytic group; and 100% and 94.7% in the exophytic group (p \u003E 0.05). Tumor size \u003E 3 cm was a significant predictor for LTP, but not for secondary efficacy. Overall major complication rate was 3.8% (24/624) and was not different among the three groups. CONCLUSION Subcapsular HCCs can be effectively treated with thermal ablation techniques. Degree of tumor-surface contact including moderate protrusion does not appear to limit feasibility or procedure effectiveness. KEY POINTS \u2022 Subcapsular HCCs can be effectively treated with thermal therapy when proper image-guided technique and assistive techniques are applied. \u2022 Degree of tumor surface contact including moderate protrusion does not appear to limit feasibility or procedure effectiveness. \u2022 Major complications after percutaneous thermal ablation of subcapsular HCCs such as tumor seeding can be minimized by avoiding breach of the tumor capsule exposed to the peritoneal surface and use of tract ablation.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Worakitsitisatorn, Akeanong; Lu, David S; Lee, Min Woo; Asvadi, Nazanin H; Moshksar, Amin; Yuen, Alexander D; McWilliams, Justin; Raman, Steven S","journal":"European radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06497-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Degree of tumor surface contact","liver surface contact","non-surface contact group","tumor protrusion","peritoneal surface","Tumor size","percutaneous thermal ablation of subcapsular HCCs","non-exophytic HCCs","secondary efficacy","tumor capsule","tumor seeding","primary technique efficacy","CONCLUSION Subcapsular HCCs","non-exophytic group","thermal ablation techniques","secondary technique efficacy rates","therapeutic efficacy","local tumor progression","complication of percutaneous thermal ablation of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinomas","LTP","thermal therapy","tract ablation","range","moderate protrusion","Major complications","proper image-guided technique","Technical success","mean size","months","years","feasibility","major complication rate","procedure effectiveness","mean age","chi-square test","assistive techniques","Fisher exact test","retrospective study","Prognostic factors","women","median follow-up","Institutional Review Board","MATERIALS","METHODS","RESULTS","Cox regression model","breach","PURPOSE","KEY POINTS","significant predictor","patients","groups"],"language":"en"},

From this information, their abundance, size, molar mass, density and anisotropy can be determined. The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined depends in part on the accuracy of the radial position recordings and the boundary conditions used in the modeling of the AUC data. The AUC instrument can spin samples at speeds up to 60,000 rpm, generating forces approaching 300,000 g. Forces of this magnitude will stretch the titanium rotors used in the instrument, shifting the boundary conditions required to solve the flow equations used in the modeling of the AUC data. A second source of error is caused by the chromatic aberration resulting from imperfections in the UV-visible absorption optics. Both errors are larger than the optical resolution of currently available instrumentation. Here, we report software routines that correct these errors, aided by a new calibration disk which can be used in place of the counterbalance to provide a calibration reference for each experiment to verify proper operation of the AUC instrument. We describe laboratory methods and software routines in UltraScan that incorporate calibrations and corrections for the rotor stretch and chromatic aberration in order to support Good Manufacturing Practices for AUC data analysis.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stoutjesdyk, Marielle; Henrickson, Amy; Minors, Geoff; Demeler, Borries","journal":"European biophysics journal : EBJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AUC instrument","AUC data analysis","chromatic aberration","boundary conditions","modeling","errors","software routines","accuracy","forces","calibration reference","new calibration disk","Good Manufacturing Practices","UltraScan","order","measure sedimentation","partial concentration of colloidal mixtures of molecules","size","molar mass","optical resolution","imperfections","calibrations","analytical ultracentrifuge","radial position recordings","diffusion coefficients","proper operation","abundance","density","UV-visible absorption optics","corrections","laboratory methods","samples","speeds","solution phase","flow equations","available instrumentation","anisotropy","magnitude","counterbalance","rpm","titanium rotors","place","information","Experiments","source of error","parameters"],"language":"en"},

However, even in high-volume centres, surgical resection is associated with significant morbidity with resultant physical decline. This systematic review explored physical function and its\u0027 implications in the management of resectable cancer of the pancreas and liver. METHODS EMBASE, Medline OVID, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched up to June 2019 using a predefined search strategy. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer resolved disagreements by consensus. RESULTS Sixteen studies with a total of 1224 participants were included. Heterogeneity of the literature prevented a meta-analysis. Physical function across the pancreatic/liver cancer trajectory has been under investigated. The relationship between physical function and pancreatic/liver cancer resection outcome remains unclear, although anaerobic threshold appears the strongest predictor of postoperative outcomes. Conclusions regarding the impact of rehabilitative interventions on physical function were limited due to risk of bias concerns. CONCLUSIONS High-quality evidence regarding the implications of physical function in resectable pancreatic and liver cancers is lacking. Well-designed trials are required to examine physical function across the pancreatic/liver cancer continuum and to measure the impact of rehabilitation on physical function. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS As survival rates for pancreatic and liver cancer slowly improve a greater understanding of the impact of these cancers and their treatments on physical function, and the potential impact of rehabilitative interventions for survivors is required.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Neill, Linda; Reynolds, Sophie; Sheill, Gr\u00E1inne; Guinan, Emer; Mockler, David; Geoghegan, Justin; Conlon, Kevin; Reynolds, John V; Hussey, Juliette","journal":"Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-020-00875-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implications of physical function","liver cancer continuum","liver cancer trajectory","CANCER SURVIVORS","liver cancers","liver cancer resection outcome","resultant physical decline","management of resectable cancer","impact of rehabilitation","potential impact of rehabilitative interventions","risk of bias assessment","risk of bias concerns","surgical resection","CONCLUSIONS High-quality evidence","CINAHL","survival rates","Cochrane Library","Medline OVID","anaerobic threshold","significant morbidity","curative treatment","texts","data extraction","strongest predictor of postoperative outcomes","greater understanding","abstracts","METHODS EMBASE","pancreas","treatments","Web of Science","studies","total","literature","high-volume centres","systematic review","relationship","meta-analysis","Screening of titles","PURPOSE Surgery","Well-designed trials","disagreements","consensus","predefined search strategy","RESULTS","participants","Heterogeneity","reviewers"],"language":"en"},

METHODS CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS All 187 patients\u0027 nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or \u0022white lung\u0022. The CT imaging features in 185 cases (98.9%) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis. The imaging features of 6 times of lung CT examination in one case showed continuous progress. The original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed, but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of CT scanning. The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P\u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics. The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT. Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes. Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Zheng; Hu, Ying; Yu, Qizhi; Li, Yuxin; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei; Liu, Jingui; Liu, Jun; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhao, Wei","journal":"Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed 101 patients who underwent DP with a triple-row stapler to identify the clinicopathological factors that strongly influence POPF after DP. The height difference (HD) was defined as the difference between the pancreatic thickness and the height of the closed stapler. RESULTS POPF occurred in 58 (57%) patients. A multivariate analysis identified HD and pancreatic thickness as independent risk factors for the occurrence of POPF after DP. Akaike\u0027s information criterion for identifying the risk factors was more favorable for HD (115.18) than for pancreatic thickness (118.02). The incidence of POPF was significantly lower (29%) in patients with an HD between 6 and 12 mm than in the other two groups (\u003C 6-mm group: 100%, P = 0.008; \u2265 12-mm group: 84%, P \u003C 0.001).

The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity. We believe that the evidence presented in this communication warrants the initiation of trials using anti-androgen agents.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wambier, Carlos Gustavo; Goren, Andy; Va\u00F1o-Galv\u00E1n, Sergio; Ramos, Paulo M\u00FCller; Ossimetha, Angelina; Nau, Gerard; Herrera, Sabina; McCoy, John","journal":"Drug development research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["androgen receptor","androgen sensitivity model","likely determinant of COVID","anti-androgen agents","hospitalized COVID","severe symptoms","disease severity","genetic variants","communication","SARS-CoV","TMPRSS2","high rates of androgenetic alopecia","mortality rates","virus-cell fusion","benign prostatic hyperplasia","prostate cancer","polycystic ovary syndrome","transmembrane protease","initiation of trials","transcription","children","males","molecular mechanisms","present arguments","addition","serine","antibodies","patients","difference","viral recognition","different ethnicities","consequences","Spike protein","host susceptibility","infection","infectivity","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients\u0027 conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aiello, Francesco; Gallo Afflitto, Gabriele; Mancino, Raffaele; Li, Ji-Peng Olivia; Cesareo, Massimo; Giannini, Clarissa; Nucci, Carlo","journal":"Eye","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0926-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV","presence of SARS","prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis","positive tear-PCR","colonization of ocular","ocular involvement","negative tear-PCR","ocular structures tropism","absence of conjunctivitis","systematic review of articles","original articles","infected patients","course of COVID","study","ongoing clinical studies","tears positivity","available data","scant information","Coronavirus disease","surrounding structures","Chinese Clinical Trial Register","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","Web of Science","PubMed","Cochrane Library","patients\u0027 conjunctival secretion","cornea","unobtainable conclusive results","additional transmission route","lacrimal sac","ChiCTR","editorials","secretions","periocular tissues","analysis","inclusion criteria","selected papers","letters","majority","RNA assay","correspondence letter","eye"],"language":"en"},

A total of 26 diagnosis and treatment protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were retrieved after screening(including 1 national scheme and 25 regional ones), among which 16 contained aspects of both prevention and treatment, 7 only involved treatment contents and 3 were prevention schemes. The courses of COVID-19 can be divided into early stage, middle stage, severe stage and recovery stage. The pathogeny of COVID-19 in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression. Its pathological features can be summarized as \u0022damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency\u0022. The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases. The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie(early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire(middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni(severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin(recovery stage). There were many diagnosis and treatment protocols for COVID-19 have been published, which generally followed the national edition, through with certain personalities in different regional protocols. There were common features with respect to the disease stage, syndrome differentiation, therapeutic principles and methods, as well as prescriptions; the treatment were generally carried out against the core pathogenesis and progress of the disease.

There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the \u0022gold-standard\u0022 CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles.

Objective To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients\u0027 age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (\u226580 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (\u003C20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, An; Liu, Li; Wang, Chaolong; Guo, Huan; Hao, Xingjie; Wang, Qi; Huang, Jiao; He, Na; Yu, Hongjie; Lin, Xihong; Wei, Sheng; Wu, Tangchun","journal":"JAMA","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","rate of confirmed cases","critical cases","number of cases","association of public health interventions","combination of public health interventions","public health policy","years","periods","series of multifaceted public health interventions","Exposures Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions","proportion of severe","severity risk","higher risk","risk ratio","daily confirmed case rate","patients\u0027 age","age groups","sex","critical disease","outbreak","elderly people","lower risk","younger people","home quarantine","centralized quarantine","median patient age","local health care workers","cordons sanitaire","traffic restriction","geographic regions","Wuhan","effective reproduction number of SARS","universal symptom survey","Measures Rates of laboratory","Importance Coronavirus disease","home confinement","geographic locations","improved control","severity classification","interquartile range","municipal Notifiable Disease Report System","social distancing","residential location","adolescents","individual-level data","cohort study","epidemiological features","Participants","occupation","Relevance","children","Chinese New Year holiday","massive human movement","Main Outcomes","countries","key events","Setting","Conclusions","general population","findings","infections","indicator of secondary transmission","Design","Objective","China","treatment","Results","pandemic","women"],"language":"en"},

We, therefore, compared SARS-CoV-2 with such known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness.

Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL. RESULTS Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter. On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man. CONCLUSIONS Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded. On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to advance medical research and should not be abandoned because of irrational fears.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dallavilla, T; Bertelli, M; Morresi, A; Bushati, V; Stuppia, L; Beccari, T; Chiurazzi, P; Marceddu, G","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_21041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["artificial origin of SARS","OBJECTIVE SARS-CoV","artificial coronaviruses","possible artificial origin","natural origin","related artificial constructs","viral sequences of SARS","study","animal coronaviruses","known viruses","relevant natural strains","mouse","biological systems","unique opportunity","human","suggestions","chimeric SL-SHC014","powerful tool","present coronavirus pandemic","laboratory","engineered organisms","genetic relatedness","CONCLUSIONS Speculations","MATERIALS","METHODS BLAST","clustalW","medical research","controlled fashion","MA15","COVID","data","notion","pangolins","Phylogenetics trees","iTOL","bats","Biotechnology","irrational fears"],"language":"en"},

However, other research suggests that additional mechanisms like hyperventilation may contribute to the process. The goal of the present investigation was to examine the influences of cardiovascular and respiratory variables on vasovagal symptoms. METHODS This study was part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of behavioral techniques on the prevention of vasovagal reactions in blood donors. Data from the no-treatment control group were analyzed. The final sample was composed of 160 college and university students. Observational and self-report measures of symptoms were obtained. Physiological variables were measured mainly using respiratory capnometry. RESULTS While respiration rate remained stable throughout donation, change in end-tidal CO2 was associated with requiring treatment for a reaction during donation (OR = .57, 95% CI = .41-.79, p = .001) and self-reported symptoms measured in the post-donation period using the Blood Donation Reactions Inventory (\u03B2=-.152, 95% CI= -.28- -.02, t=-2.32, p=.022). Individuals with higher levels of pre-donation anxiety displayed larger decreases in end-tidal CO2 throughout the procedure (F(2,236) = 3.64, p = .043, \u03B7p = .030). BDRI scores were related to changes in systolic (\u03B2=-.022, 95% CI= -.04- -.004, t=-2.39, p=.019) and diastolic blood pressure (\u03B2=-.038, 95% CI= -.06- -.02, t=-4.03, p \u003C.001). CONCLUSIONS While the vasovagal reaction has traditionally been viewed as a primarily cardiovascular event, the present results suggest that hyperventilation also plays a role in the development of vasovagal symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mennitto, Serena; Ritz, Thomas; Robillard, Pierre; France, Christopher R; Ditto, Blaine","journal":"Psychosomatic medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Blood Donation Reactions Inventory","BDRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of vasovagal symptoms","CI","development of symptoms","Blood Donation Reactions Inventory","prevention of vasovagal reactions","self-reported symptoms","post-donation period","self-report measures of symptoms","end-tidal CO2","blood donors","influences of cardiovascular","respiratory variables","cardiovascular event","hyperventilation","present results","research","higher levels of pre-donation anxiety","diastolic blood pressure","contributions of cardiovascular activity","requiring treatment","present investigation","Physiological variables","respiratory capnometry","treatment control group","larger decreases","effects of behavioral techniques","randomized controlled trial","college","changes","Individuals","procedure","respiration rate","role","study","additional mechanisms","BDRI scores","university students","final sample","goal","Data","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","process","\u03B7p"],"language":"en"},

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the primary means of identifying acute infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow for rapid therapeutic interventions.Methods. We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert\u00AE Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test, a rapid, automated molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. Analytical sensitivity and specificity/interference were assessed with infectious SARS-CoV-2, other infectious coronavirus species including SARS-CoV, and 85 nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive for other respiratory viruses including endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs). Clinical performance was assessed using 483 remnant upper and lower respiratory specimens previously analyzed by standard of care (SOC) NAATs.Results. The limit of detection of the Xpert test was 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL. Other hCoVs, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, were not detected by the Xpert test. SARS-CoV, a closely related species in the Sarbecovirus subgenus, was detected by a broad-range target (E) but was distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-specific N2 target). Compared to SOC NAATs, the positive agreement of the Xpert test was 219/220 (99.5%) and the negative agreement was 250/261 (95.8%). A third tie-breaker NAAT resolved all but three of the discordant results in favor the Xpert test.Conclusions. The Xpert test provided sensitive and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. The high sensitivity and fast time to results of approximately 45 minutes may impact patient management.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loeffelholz, Michael J; Alland, David; Butler-Wu, Susan M; Pandey, Utsav; Perno, Carlo Frederico; Nava, Alice; Carroll, Karen C; Mostafa, Heba; Davies, Emma; McEwan, Ashley; Rakeman, Jennifer L; Fowler, Randal C; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Fourati, Slim; Banik, Sukalyani; Banada, Padmapriya P; Swaminathan, Shobha; Chakravorty, Soumitesh; Kwiatkowski, Robert W; Chu, Victor C; Kop, JoAnn; Gaur, Rajiv; Sin, Mandy L Y; Nguyen, Duy; Singh, Simranjit; Zhang, Na; Persing, David H","journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00926-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAAT"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Xpert test","infectious SARS-CoV","Xpress SARS-CoV","fast test results","accurate detection of SARS","lower respiratory specimens","automated molecular test","respiratory viruses","lower respiratory tract specimens","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SOC NAATs","discordant results","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","infectious coronavirus species","positive agreement","hCoVs","Analytical sensitivity","nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive","clinical performance characteristics","acute infections","remnant upper","variety of upper","related species","limit of detection","fast time","high sensitivity","negative agreement","rapid therapeutic interventions","broad-range target","specific N2 target","isolation resources","efficient use of protective","standard of care","endemic human coronaviruses","interference","primary means","Nucleic acid amplification tests","specificity","plaque","units","Sarbecovirus subgenus","minutes","Methods","tie-breaker NAAT","patient management","PFU","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, the supervision of the adherence of clinical research to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and legal regulations is of the utmost importance. Yet, while such regulations have remained largely unchanged during recent years, the number of administrative tasks and their complexity have grown markedly, as supported by the results of a survey performed among 940 clinical investigators that we report in this manuscript. Therefore, many investigators believe that it has become necessary to undertake a rigorous analysis of the causes and consequences of this issue, and to create a conduit to channel the advice from experienced investigators regarding clinical research procedures, in order to improve them. Based on these premises, ESMO has launched the ESMO Clinical Research Observatory (ECRO), a task force that will analyse different aspects of clinical research. ECRO will aim to provide the views of ESMO on clinical research procedures based on the feedback from clinical investigators, under complete adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki, the GCP guidelines and any other applicable legal regulations, while at the same time showing profound respect for all the stakeholders involved in clinical research. This manuscript provides the background and rationale for the creation of ECRO, its planned activity and an analysis of the current administrative burden in clinical research with recommendations to rationalise it. Indeed, we expect that this effort shall lead to a relevant improvement in the care of patients and in the development of clinical research.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez-Gracia, Jose Luis; Awada, Ahmad; Calvo, Emiliano; Amaral, Teresa; Arkenau, Hendrik-Tobias; Gruenwald, Viktor; Bodoky, Gyorgy; Lolkema, Martijn P; Di Nicola, Massimo; Penel, Nicolas; Vera, Ruth; Sanmamed, Miguel F; Douillard, Jean-Yves","journal":"ESMO open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2019-000662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Good Clinical Practice","GCP","ESMO Clinical Research Observatory","ECRO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical research procedures","adherence of clinical research","development of clinical research","ESMO Clinical Research Observatory","activity of clinical investigators","different aspects of clinical research","research teams","Good Clinical Practice","experienced investigators","GCP guidelines","current administrative burden","views of ESMO","applicable legal regulations","creation of ECRO","manuscript","number of administrative tasks","bureaucratic burden","complete adherence","planned activity","rigorous analysis","recent years","feedback","Declaration of Helsinki","advice","care of patients","task force","relevant improvement","causes","consequences","rationale","dramatic increase","stakeholders","recommendations","overall efficiency","issue","profound respect","conduit","background","time","complexity","utmost importance","survey","supervision","order","effort","impact","premises","results"],"language":"en"},

Rapid increases in patient volumes have exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems and challenged our ability to provide optimal patient care and adequate safety measures to healthcare workers (HCWs). OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that US neurologists were experiencing significant challenges with lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid changes in practice and varying institutional protocols, we conducted this survey study. METHODS A 36-item survey was distributed to neurologists around the US through various media platforms. RESULTS Over a one-week period, 567 responses were received. Of these, 56% practiced in academia. A total of 87% had access to PPE with 45% being asked to reuse PPE due to shortages. The pandemic caused rapid changes in practice, most notably a shift towards providing care by teleneurology, although a third experienced challenges in transitioning to this model. Wide variations were noted both in testing and in the guidance provided for the exposed, sick or vulnerable HCWs. Notably, 59% of respondents felt that their practices were doing what they could, although 56% did not feel safe taking care of patients. CONCLUSIONS Results from our survey demonstrate significant variability in preparedness and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic in neurology, impacted by region, health care setting and practice model. Practice guidelines from professional societies and other national entities are needed to improve protection for physicians and their patients, promote recommended practice changes during a pandemic, and optimize future preparedness for public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Akanksha; Maxwell, Christina R; Farmer, Jill; Greene-Chandos, Diana; LaFaver, Kathrin; Benameur, Karima","journal":"Neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","practice model","rapid changes","recommended practice changes","Practice guidelines","care of patients","PPE","optimal patient care","health care setting","significant challenges","US neurologists","Rapid increases","COVID","item survey","survey study","patient volumes","significant variability","healthcare systems","healthcare workers","exposed weaknesses","experienced challenges","future preparedness","vulnerable HCWs","widespread disease","CONCLUSIONS Results","public health emergencies","current coronavirus disease","adequate safety measures","lack of personal protective equipment","region","varying institutional protocols","professional societies","responsiveness","national entities","protection","teleneurology","hypothesis","various media platforms","testing","week period","BACKGROUND","guidance","physicians","transitioning","death","shift","Wide variations","responses","OBJECTIVE","access","METHODS","respondents","practices","total","shortages","academia"],"language":"en"},

This work presents an investigation of the deflection and structural stability of nanohole array-based optofluidic sensors operating in flow-through mode. The analysis was approached using experiments, simulations via finite element method, and established theoretical models. The results depict that certain areas of the sensor deflect under pressure, with some regions suffering high mechanical stress. The offset in the deflection values between theoretical models and actual experimental values is overturned when only the effective area of the substrate, of 450 \u00B5m, is considered. Experimental, theoretical, and simulation results suggest that the periodic nanostructures can safely operate under trans-membrane pressures of up to 20 psi, which induce deflections of up to ~20 \u03BCm.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bdour, Yazan; Gomez-Cruz, Juan; Escobedo, Carlos","journal":"Micromachines","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11040373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["theoretical models","deflection values","optical sensors","substrate","flow","structural stability of nanohole array-based optofluidic sensors","actual experimental values","periodic nanostructures","simulation results","structural failure","periodic arrays of subwavelength apertures","nanoapertures experience pressure differences","finite element method","experiments","simulations","operation","surface plasmon resonance","regions","investigation","trans-membrane pressures","certain areas","high mechanical stress","psi","nanofluidic structures","offset","effective area","deflections","analysis","risk","work","\u03BCm","\u00B5m"],"language":"en"},

The synthesis of distal fleximers in particular, has thus far been quite tedious and low yielding. As a potential solution to this issue, a series of proximal fleximer bases (flex-bases) were successfully coupled to both ribose and 2\u0027-deoxyribose sugars using the N -deoxyribosyltransferase II of Lactobacillus leichmannii ( Ll NDT) and E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). To explore the range of this facile approach, transglycosylation experiments using a thieno-expanded tricyclic heterocyclic base, as well as several distal and proximal flex-bases were performed to determine whether the corresponding fleximer nucleosides could be obtained in this fashion, thus potentially significantly shortening the route to these biologically significant compounds.

Such a defining moment in the history of health-related infections led to transformations in its proponents, as well as their medical practice. This research article, using a study consisting of semi-structured interviews with six Canadian gay physicians from different Canadian HIV/AIDS treatment centers, aims to offer insights into their lived journeys, from 1981 to 2009, while they attempted to treat, care for, and cure/heal their gay HIV/AIDS patients. The results of the study, deduced from a qualitative and interpretative data analysis, suggest that through reflection on their experiences during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, they transformed their personal and professional identities, and rethought their relationship with their patients, as well as their professional, pharmaceutical, and community networks. These results are testimonies from Canadian gay physicians who fought against the HIV/AIDS pandemic and who advocated for their gay HIV/AIDS patients. In fact, these results are evidence of an untold and valuable period in medical history. For some, it will serve as a reminder. For others, it will be foreign. It was a time marked by a major crisis that mobilized gay militant physicians who were personally and professionally affected, and who were forever transformed by their response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

In this paper we are concerned with Timed Automata for the specification of timed behaviour of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC), as used in the stochastic temporal logic CSL[Formula: see text]. A timed path formula of CSL[Formula: see text] is specified by a Deterministic Timed Automaton (DTA) that features two kinds of transitions: synchronizing transitions (triggered by CTMC transitions) and autonomous transitions (triggered when a clock reaches a given threshold). Other definitions of CSL[Formula: see text] are based on DTAs that do not include autonomous transitions. This raises the natural question: do autonomous transitions enhance expressiveness and/or conciseness of DTAs? We prove that this is the case and we provide a syntactical characterization of DTAs for which autonomous transitions do not add expressive power, but allow one to define exponentially more concise DTAs.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donatelli, Susanna; Haddad, Serge","journal":"Language and Automata Theory and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c3656c81c6750d6cddec5715f0ccba5361d66c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Timed Automata","CSL","Deterministic Timed Automaton","CTMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autonomous transitions","CTMC transitions","synchronizing transitions","Timed Automata","kinds of transitions","timed path formula of CSL","timed behaviours","text","Deterministic Timed Automaton","conciseness of DTAs","concise DTAs","definitions of CSL","syntactical characterization of DTAs","specification of timed behaviour of Continuous Time Markov Chains","stochastic temporal logic CSL","well-known formalism","expressiveness","clock","natural question","expressive power","given threshold","case","paper"],"language":"en"},

Apps for pruritus could also play a role in the management of symptoms. AIM: The aim of this article is to review existing apps for pruritus. In addition, we will discuss whether these apps have been validated and how and which offers might still be lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The two largest app stores as well as PubMed and Google were searched for apps regarding pruritus. Relevant medical apps were documented and categorized with respect to their functions. PubMed was searched to identify validation studies. RESULTS: In total 21 apps for pruritus were identified. Of those 12 explicitly focused on pruritus, while 8 included pruritus as a symptom of an underlying disease (especially eczema and urticaria). The following app categories were derived: medical history of chronic pruritus, assessment of pruritus in clinical trials, assessment of nocturnal pruritus, information about pruritus, and diseases with pruritus as a symptom. Three of the apps with explicit focus on pruritus have been scientifically validated. DISCUSSION: There are different apps for pruritus available. Most apps which explicitly focus on pruritus are aimed at physicians and scientists, while apps for diseases with pruritus as a symptom are more patient-centered. Due to technological advances, apps and wearables could improve management of pruritus in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schuster, B.; Dugas, M.; Zink, A.","journal":"Hautarzt","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bf2938138f1faf373dee36b87219d7576240f0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216863.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216863/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assessment of pruritus","management of pruritus","pruritus available","different apps","existing apps","assessment of nocturnal pruritus","medical history of chronic pruritus","Relevant medical apps","diseases","PubMed","AIM","management of symptoms","explicit focus","largest app stores","following app categories","clinical trials","wearables","information","underlying disease","METHODS","article","Google","scientists","eczema","urticaria","technological advances","role","physicians","MATERIALS","validation studies","respect","RESULTS","DISCUSSION","future","patient","daily lives","functions","BACKGROUND","addition"],"language":"en"},

To ensure the quality of patient care (QPC) appropriate implementation of the patient care technology management system (PCTMS) is necessary. Unfortunately, it is found to be absent in the healthcare delivery system in most of the countries in the world. The situation is very much severe, particularly, in medium- and low-income countries like Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc. The opposite scenario is found in high-income countries, specifically, in Japan where QPC has been improved significantly by adopting the clinical engineering approach (CEA) in their PCDS. Up to now, QPC is determined based on prediction as there are no mathematical ways to evaluate it properly. In this study, we for the first time, propose a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively based on feedback control analogy taking into account of CEA in PCTMS, particularly, for clinical and surgical equipment. The model consists of three subsections: the clinical engineering department (CED), PCTMS, and health care engineering directorate (HCED). The correlation among the subsections and their performance parameters are defined and standardized. Multiple linear regression method is applied to derive the least square normal equations for each of the subsections and then the regression coefficients are solved by the standard data taken from 1000 beds hospitals of different countries. The model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC for 18 different countries including high-, middle-, and low-income countries of the world. The results obtained from the model demonstrate that the present status of QPC in Japan is 84.69% and in Pakistan, it is only 0.20%. This huge discrepancy is identified to be caused by the inclusion of CEA in PCDS of Japan. The proposed model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital/in a country and hence to take necessary steps accordingly for establishing the proposed research methodology. It is to be mentioned here that the proposed model cannot be applied to evaluate the QPC in some countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. due to the unavailability of data related to the model parameters.","publish_time":"2019-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, Md.

As a result, contradictions arise in the practice of research ethics, and a number of urgent issues are not given due consideration.

Based on the Italian Ministry of Health data, we reconstructed the daily course of virus-positive cases and deaths during March 2020 for whole Italy, 19 regions and 2 provinces. From February 29 to March 31 there was a 100.9-fold increase in the cumulative number of cases and a 428.6-fold increase in the number of deaths in Italy. When plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, the curves tended to diverge from linearity with 23%, 16%, and 7% average daily increases during the 3 decades of March. Similarly, the number of deaths decreased from an average daily growth of 19% during the 2nd decade to 10% during the 3rd decade. The correlation coefficients relating the days to cases or deaths during each one of the 3 decades approached the unity. As inferred from the equations of the regression lines relative to the 3 decades, the doubling times of cases were 3.4, 5.1 and 9.6 days, respectively. The doubling times of deaths during the 2nd and 3rd decades were 4.9 and 7.0 days, respectively. There was a broad geographic variability, with a striking gradient from North, where 40.8% of cases and 57.9% of deaths occurred in Lombardy, to South. On the whole, during March there was a trend to epidemic growth decline, but the time for the end of the epidemic will depend on a variety of factors and, at present, it is unpredictable.

In adults the staircase phenomenon can be avoided by tetanic prestimulation. This study examined, if tetanic prestimulation eliminates the staircase phenomenon in children. After written informed consent, the neuromuscular function of 80 children, 10 in each age group (\u003C 6 months, 6-12 months, 12-24 months, 2-3 years, 3-6 years, 6-12 years, 12-18 years, and \u2265 18 years) was measured on both arms simultaneously over 30 min under general anaesthesia. The ulnaris nerve was stimulated using the TOF technique every 15 s. The twitch response (T1, TOF ratio [TOFR]) was measured by acceleromyography. Before calibration, tetanic prestimmulation (50 Hz for 5 s) was administered to one randomly selected arm. The effect of tetanic prestimulation and age was analysed using general linear models based on the normalized T1 and TOFRs of both arms. Tetanic prestimulation significantly affected T1 values avoiding the staircase phenomenon (p \u003C 0.0001). After 5.8 min [1.0-17.2 min] the normalized T1 values increased to 117% [102-147%] without prestimulation (p \u003C 0.0001) independent of the age group (p = 0.539). The normalized TOFR was stable throughout the observation period of 30 min 100% [95-107%].

A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19. Methods A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. Results The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p \u003C 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p \u003C 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p \u003C 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p \u003C 0.01 and p \u003C 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19. Conclusions Some urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Rui; Ma, Qingfeng; Han, Huan; Su, Hanwen; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Wang, Wei; Zhu, Chengliang","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","differentiation of COVID","biochemical parameters of urine","healthy controls","value of urine biochemical parameters","results of urine biochemical parameters","healthy persons","significant proportion of patients","urine specific gravity","urine potential of hydrogen","positive rates of urine glucose","positive rates of urine occult blood","routine body fluid parameters","GLU-U","relationship","critical groups","severe acute respiratory syndrome","nucleic acid testing","body fluid samples","viral nucleic acid test","auxiliary diagnosis","moderate group","SG","pH","SARS","proteinuria","prediction","coronavirus disease","cases","identification","Conclusions","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","Background","period","total","hematological indicators","Methods","aim"],"language":"en"},

Infected children may be asymptomatic or present fever, dry cough, fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms. The CDC recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS 42 children (the majority \u003C 5 years of age) were referred, to our Pediatric Department, as possible cases of COVID-19 infection. Blood analysis, chest X-ray, and naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens for viral identification of COVID-19 were requested. RESULTS None of the screened children resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%). An high C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively. Almost half of patients (45.2%) required hospitalization in our Pediatric Unit and one patient in Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition criteria is essential for clinical management and outbreak control.

The newly emerged coronavirus COVID-19 is strongly related to SARS-CoV except little dissimilarity. In this chapter, we will discuss about the alterations and variations in antigenicity, structural changes, and RNA recombination which might be responsible for the COVID-19 emergence.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baxi, Preeti; Saxena, Shailendra K.","journal":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e97c5b77a1087083a18fe6dccdf2f7029cfc8ad7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","emerged coronavirus COVID","emerged COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pathogenic coronavirus","MERS-CoV","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","source of coronavirus disease","outbreak of SARS","RNA recombination","previous reported coronaviruses","species barrier","novel coronaviruses","human population","emergence","introduction","positive-strand RNA viruses","epidemic viruses","structural changes","date","vaccine","specific medicines","antigenicity","variations","epidemics","nCoV","market","alterations","transmission capability","worldwide concern","humans","little dissimilarity","alarming rate","kind of viral pneumonia","Wuhan","China","century","chapter"],"language":"en"},

This paper is a first step towards a different direction focusing on the independent application of the existing models to popular open source projects.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapllani, Gerta; Khomyakov, Ilya; Mirgalimova, Ruzilya; Sillitti, Alberto","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/575890aa438b1b0509862624120b874fdbb0d9d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing models","independent application","popular open source projects","independent evaluation","independent way","Maintainability","open source system","limited set of projects","existing work","different direction","number of different approaches","evolution","people","distributed development teams","key factor","step","performance","specific approach","product","literature","method","paper","cases"],"language":"en"},

KAOS goal modelling is a software engineering approach that allows to identify high level goals of an organisation, refine and expand them into lower-level more concrete goals and assign them to specific system agents. The two approaches can be combined, such that the goal modelling is used to derive specific goals rooted in the organisational context, policies and strategies of an organisation. The GQM, in turn, utilises the derived specific goals to produce appropriate and meaningful metrics that can be used to obtain valuable insights and track the state and progress of the formulated goals. Moreover, both models can be presented within a single diagram, thus providing an expressive and concise overview of the systems goals, actors and measurements. The suggested combination is then applied in the context of an open source project, followed by the discussion on potential benefits and drawbacks of using the two approaches.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Askarbekuly, Nursultan; Sadovykh, Andrey; Mazzara, Manuel","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b9f3f40723b620b1eb279050623812f23c40ab3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GQM","KAOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systems goals","derived specific goals","concrete goals","formulated goals","high level goals","meaningful metrics","appropriate measurement metrics","software metrics method","specific system agents","GQM","approaches","KAOS goal modelling","organisational context","lower-level","software engineering approach","discussion","state","concise overview","drawbacks","progress","actors","policies","strategies","turn","open source project","potential benefits","measurements","single diagram","valuable insights","suggested combination","models"],"language":"en"},

Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Connolly, Creighton; Keil, Roger; Ali, S.

Automated heartbeat classification provides a cost-effective screening for heart arrhythmia and allows at-risk patients to receive timely treatments, which is a highly demanded but challenging task. Recent works have brought visible improvements to this area, but to identify the problematic supraventricular ectopic (S-type) heartbeats is still a bottleneck in most existing studies. This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S-type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S-type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types. As an improvement, we also propose a rule-based data augmentation method to solve the training data imbalance problem. The proposed framework is evaluated over three real-world ECG databases.

It is well known that Chinese sentences with different polysemous words or word order may have totally different semantic meanings. Thus, to represent and match the sentence semantic meaning accurately, one challenge that must be solved is how to capture the semantic features from the multi-granularity perspective, e.g., characters and words. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel sentence semantic matching model which is based on the fusion of semantic features from character-granularity and word-granularity, respectively. Particularly, the multi-granularity fusion intends to extract more semantic features to better optimize the downstream sentence semantic matching. In addition, we propose the equilibrium cross-entropy, a novel loss function, by setting mean square error (MSE) as an equilibrium factor of cross-entropy. The experimental results conducted on Chinese open data set demonstrate that our proposed model combined with binary equilibrium cross-entropy loss function is superior to the existing state-of-the-art sentence semantic matching models.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xu; Lu, Wenpeng; Zhang, Guoqiang; Li, Fangfang; Wang, Shoujin","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/670f7dc7cc303a53c1027c285f4c839c4a7a3f03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sentence semantic meaning","downstream sentence semantic matching","fusion of semantic features","novel sentence semantic matching model","different semantic meanings","existing state-of-the-art sentence semantic matching models","word-granularity","multi-granularity fusion","character-granularity","binary equilibrium cross-entropy loss function","Chinese language processing","equilibrium factor of cross","multi-granularity perspective","novel loss function","Chinese sentences","challenge","different polysemous words","proposed model","word order","natural language processing tasks","Chinese open data set","cornerstone","experimental results","MSE","square error","characters","addition"],"language":"en"},

Most graph embedding methods learn only the topological structure of graphs. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the incorporation of node attributes is beneficial in improving the expressive power of node embeddings. However, real-world graphs are often noisy in terms of structure and/or attributes (missing and/or erroneous edges/attributes). Most existing graph embedding methods are susceptible to this noise, as they do not consider uncertainty during the modelling process. In this paper, we introduce RASE, a Robust Attribute and Structure preserving graph Embedding model. RASE is a novel graph representation learning model which effectively preserves both graph structure and node attributes through a unified loss function. To be robust, RASE uses a denoising attribute auto-encoder to deal with node attribute noise, and models uncertainty in the embedding space as Gaussians to cope with graph structure noise. We evaluate the performance of RASE through an extensive experimental study on various real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that RASE outperforms state-of-the-art embedding methods on multiple graph analysis tasks and is robust to both structure and attribute noise.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hettige, Bhagya; Wang, Weiqing; Li, Yuan-Fang; Buntine, Wray","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ee197f17401d5b73299c475702e45430daf31bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RASE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graph structure noise","existing graph","node attribute noise","state-of-the-art embedding methods","multiple graph analysis tasks","Robust Attribute","terms of structure","embedding space","incorporation of node attributes","wide range of graph analysis tasks","node classification","performance of RASE","topological structure of graphs","novel graph representation learning model","expressive power of node embeddings","real-world graphs","denoising attribute auto-encoder","models uncertainty","various real-world datasets","extensive experimental study","link prediction","Gaussians","unified loss function","Results","erroneous edges","modelling process","paper"],"language":"en"},

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID- 19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods We conducted a multi-country, large-scale (N = 5995) study to measure public support for digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs. automatic installation by mobile phone providers), and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We inves- tigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Altmann, S.; Milsom, L.; Zillessen, H.; Blasone, R.; Gerdon, F.; Bach, R.; Kreuter, F.; Nosenzo, D.; Toussaert, S.; Abeler, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4af14ce29f55afc037b9050c374fd274f0c870bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20091587v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["contact-tracing app","app take-up","app-based contact-tracing","app-based contact tracing","acceptability of app","digital contact tracing of COVID","mobile phone app","Countries","diffusion of COVID","spread of COVID","public support","regional-level COVID","different installation regimes","automatic installation","voluntary installation","study","strong support","pandemic","general population","concerns","intentions","greatest public health crisis","mobile phone providers","Epidemiological evidence","viable approach","user acceptability","theoretical effectiveness","available evidence","health systems","number of infections","main barriers","main factors","different disease settings","potential privacy implications","Germany","close contacts","Italy","France","lives","solution","consideration","anonymous online surveys","multi-country","time","lockdowns","large socio-economic costs","government","lack of trust","various levels of lockdown","apps","cyber security","exit strategy","mortality rates","UK","Recent research","sub-groups","Conclusions","proportion","Methods","adoption","Objectives","years","Results","willingness","individuals","intervention","Background","findings"],"language":"en"},

Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19.

We aimed to assess the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on all cause mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan from February 12th to March 2nd, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. All patients were followed until death or end of follow up (March 9th), and all survivors were followed for at least one week. Findings: Of 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (SD 1.8) years and 30 (83.3%) were men. 22 (61.1%) patients received CRRT (CRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed in conventional strategy (non CRRT group). There was no difference in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients in the CRRT group with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatinine. During the average follow-up period of 10.4 days, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non CRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a prolonged survival in patients in CRRT group than non CRRT group (P=0.032). The association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors in seven different models, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) varying between 0.283 and 0.424. Older age, higher levels of IL1b, IL2 receptor, hs cTnI and NT proBNP were independently associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with CRRT treatment. Interpretation: CRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yi; Shi, Jia; Ge, Shuwang; Guo, Shuiming; Xing, Xue; Wang, Yanan; Cheng, Anying; Liu, Qingquan; Li, Junhua; Ning, Yong; He, Fan; Xu, Gang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4724fb5dae8558f878103d1ebf49c1431c28f113.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kaplan Meier"],"organizations":["COVID","Tongji Medical College","CRRT"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["CRRT group","CRRT treatment","ill patients","treatment of COVID","invasive mechanical ventilation","hospitalized COVID","cause mortality","treatment data","reduced risk of mortality","increased risk of mortality","mean age","Older age","high mortality rate","laboratory findings","Wuhan","higher levels of IL1b","higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase","Tongji Medical College","Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital","IL2 receptor","prolonged survival","Huazhong University of Science","hs cTnI","NT proBNP","different models","prospective multicenter studies","larger sample sizes","sex","comorbidities","treatments","effect of continuous renal replacement therapy","adjusted hazard ratio","confounding factors","serum creatinine","Kaplan Meier analysis","Technology","complications","retrospective cohort study","average follow-up period","days","Methods","aHR","SD","difference","world","association","conventional strategy","Demographic","coronavirus disease","death","end","Interpretation","cases","survivors","week","years","Background"],"language":"en"},

We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People\u0027s Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7bed9242759e99e525ed5f0e9f54e66e397f446.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission","World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Republic","South Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["IFP of new cases","cured cases","critical cases","non-severe cases","variation of new cases","cumulative confirmed cases","non-Hubei model","IFP of increment","number of confirmed cases","rate of new increment","tremendous infected cases","Hubei province","daily increment rate","IFP of time","Iran","Italy","transcendental model","predictive model","death data","augment of data","world epidemic trend","South Korean","New close contacts","state transition matrix model","optimistic scenario","relative pessimistic scenario","numbers of cumulative confirmed patients","People\u0027s Republic of China","global trend","World Health Organization","fitting scenarios","assignment of global medical resources","international medical resources","development of COVID","training set","validation set","National Health Commission","horizon","various influences","reports","adjustment","arrival","subsequent days","adoption of different diagnosis criteria","coronavirus disease","inflection point","pneumonia","burst","strategy","Results","Wuhan","room","improvement","metrics","Background","high transmissibility","Methods","modeling","quarantine","estimation","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients\u0027histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P\u003E0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P \u003C 0.05). Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Weiping; Bishnu, Gautam; Cai, Zhenzhai; Shen, Xian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c9e3ca9157df93771662c0a330bf2f75bfdbca2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wenzhou"],"keyphrases":["main clinical symptoms of patients","main epidemic area","respiratory symptoms","systemic symptoms","groups","secondary epidemic areas","evaluation of novel coronavirus-infected patients","C-reactive protein values","epidemic situation","primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection","clinical characteristics of infected patients","clinical data","increased serum amyloid protein","clinical prevention","clinical manifestations","significant differences","monocyte count","respiratory tract ailments","neutrophil count","leukocyte count","SAA","treatment","diagnosis","disease","time","effective evaluation index","chest pain","chest tightness","monocyte ratio","specific blood test results","blood parameters","baseline data","auxiliary index","fatigue","hemoglobin","cough","travel history","reference","fever","control","COVID","signs","absence of residency","abnormal increase","Conclusion","potential biomarkers","CRP changes","presence","Wenzhou city","Objective","Methods","onset","patients\u0027histories"],"language":"en"},

We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID-19 reported death rate time series. Our analysis shows good agreement with reported COVID-19 mortality for age\u003C70 years, but an excess in total mortality increasing with age above 70 years, suggesting there is a large population of predominantly old people missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 \u00B1 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57% in the most affected province of Bergamo,which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6% (1.7%) of the total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.6% (4.6%) in age group 80-89, and 3.41% (10.2%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and 26% of total COVID-19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates(IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23% (12%-41%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67% (33%-100%, 95% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modi, Chirag; Boehm, Vanessa; Ferraro, Simone; Stein, George; Seljak, Uros","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78576bc0f9f19b279a0cfd0505f374cba5bb7963.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20067074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Data Science","Infection Fatality Rate","Yearly Mortality Rate","IFR","NYC"],"locations":["Bergamo"],"keyphrases":["mortality data","years","age group","total mortality","Yearly Mortality Rate","Population Fatality Rate","excess mortality","number of COVID","IFR lower bound","function of age","reported COVID","total COVID","total population","Infection Fatality Rate","steep age dependence","Italy","official number","PFR","Bergamo province","affected region of Lombardia","reported death rate time series","affected province of Bergamo","existing data","large population","Test Positivity Rate","number of infected people","counterfactual time series analysis","Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR","official fatality statistics","number of positive tests","regions","factor","different Data Science methods","old people","good agreement","infection rates","times higher","ages","IR","NYC","YMR","towns","herd immunity","deaths","control","world","provinces"],"language":"en"},

Given the global demand for fast and reliable diagnosis to determine the carrier individuals, a stock-out scenario for a number of essential reagents/kits used along the diagnostic process has been foreseen by many organizations. Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and/or diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher safety are ensured.

Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR. Conclusion: Direct and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisman, David; Greer, Amy; Tuite, Ashleigh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1edd2ed5ca36137c64554e553d7ba6b5bf3909ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR","SMR"],"locations":["China","Japan","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["higher CFR","country variability","apparent size of COVID","Chinese epidemic","identical age-specific attack rates","single country","impact of age","country variation","Epidemiological data","severity of COVID","secondary data analysis","larger apparent epidemic sizes","under-recognition of younger cases","differing age structures","Japan","different countries","case studies","indirect standardization","Chinese Center","specific under-reporting","Italy","younger populations","older populations","case ascertainment","earlier outbreak recognition","Indonesia","pandemic","Egypt","missing cases","SMR","epidemics","China","case fatality ratio","key insights","order effects","older individuals","sentinel epidemiological study","simple tools","CCDC","time","Disease Control","estimates","early stage","ICU saturation","Design","Adjustment","Standardized morbidity ratios","mathematical modeling","attempt","Conclusion","Limitations","Background","opposite effect","Setting","Objective","Results","Measurements","Interventions"],"language":"en"},

Here, we used recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-COV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jiumeng; Yan, Ziqing; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Gao, Qi; He, Wan-Ting; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7210646c4d032b5150779d69df9abee452eb49c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV","ACE2 of bats","host receptor ACE2","origin of SARS","S-binding","ACE2 of pangolin exhibit","low levels of ACE2","putative intermediate hosts of SARS","lower expression of ACE2","interaction sites of ACE2 proteins","prediction of potential hosts of SARS","binding site","X-ray structures of human ACE2","receptor-binding domain","Effective binding","RBD of S","pets","receptor usage","animal source of infection","S-interface","amino acid changes","changes relative","infection of cells","livestock","species barrier","residues important","respective animal","variable amino acids","bat virus","analysis","upper respiratory tract","risk of potential cross-species transmission","farm animals","different animals","invariable residues","glycosylation sites","host range","similar number of substitutions","raccoon","prerequisite","certain positions","new insight","spike protein","acquisition of N","periphery","framework","loss","novel coronavirus","civet","viruses","unknown scientific questions","vaccines available","drugs","analyses","research","emergence","threatening people","note","pigs","dogs","spread","monitoring","Comparison","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set.

The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of \u00B5-oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. Objective We further characterize the effect of \u00B5-rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. Methods A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to \u00B5-rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. Results MEP amplitude is modulated by \u00B5-phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the \u00B5-rhythm negative peak. Conclusion The choice of stimulation intensity influences the observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation by \u00B5-phase. Lower stimulation intensities enable more efficient differentiation of EEG \u00B5-phase-defined brain states.","publish_time":"2018-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schaworonkow, Natalie; Triesch, Jochen; Ziemann, Ulf; Zrenner, Christoph","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90448d6b1b63ce1d28941f8c5e9857329603d7fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/251363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEP IO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different stimulation intensities","Lower stimulation intensities","\u00B5-rhythm negative peak","stimulation parameters","positive peak of \u00B5","wide range of stimulation intensities","effect of \u00B5","efficient differentiation of EEG \u00B5-phase","\u00B5-rhythm surface positive","surface negative peak","fixed stimulation intensity","choice of stimulation intensity","scalp surface negative EEG peak","rhythm phase","weak intensities","intermediate intensities","degree of excitability modulation","transcranial magnetic stimulation","calibrated MEP IO curve","largest absolute MEP-modulation","largest relative MEP-modulation","relevant EEG-defined brain states","observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation","Results MEP amplitude","real-time EEG-TMS system","MEP input-output","Background Corticospinal excitability","instantaneous brain-states","larger MEPs","negative peaks","recent development of real-time EEG","current brain state","larger motor evoked potentials","sensorimotor cortex","oscillations","discrimination","leftward shift","healthy participants","Methods","relationship","Conclusion","causal fashion","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Although Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is a sign of initial community transmission. An estimate of possible scenarios to prepare health resources in the future is needed. We used modelling methods to estimate impacts of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods: SEIR model built in the COVIDSIM1.1 tool was adopted using available data for estimation. The herd immunization scenario was with no intervention implemented. Other scenarios consisted of isolation and social distancing at different levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively). Outcomes include epidemic apex, daily new and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients and ICU beds needed. Results: By April 8, 2020, there would be 465 infected cases with COVID-19 in Viet Nam, of those 50% were detected. Cumulatively, there would be 1,400 cases and 30 deaths by end of 2020, if 75% of cases was detected and isolated, and 30% of social distancing could be maintained. The most effective intervention scenario is the detection and isolation of 75% infected cases and reduction of 10% social contacts. This will require an expansion of testing capacity at health facilities and in the community, posing a challenge to identify high-risk groups to prioritized testing. Conclusions: In a localized epidemic setting, the expansion of testing should be the key measure to control the epidemic. Social distancing plays a significant role to prevent further transmission to the community.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, T. A.; Nguyen, Q. C.; Le, A. T. K.; Nguyen, H.

The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participants data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal.

We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through up to 5 years of follow-up. Genetic polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 that functionally affect type III interferons were genotyped with TaqMan assays. For both genetic variants and each infection, we evaluated time-to-first episode and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of an infection episode during follow-up, controlling for relevant covariates. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-\u03BB4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.003) and respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele \u2013 for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p=0.005) and malaria (OR=1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p=0.033). IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 were in moderate linkage disequilibrium in this population (r2=0.78), and all the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-\u03BB4 and not IFN-\u03BB3 as the primary cause of these associations.

Methods We report the characteristics (demographics, prior conditions and medication use) of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between December 2019 and April 2020 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], STAnford Medicine Research data Repository [STARR-OMOP], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]) and Health Insurance Review \u0026 Assessment [HIRA] of South Korea. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were compared with patients previously hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 6,806 (US: 1,634, South Korea: 5,172) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Patients in the US were majority male (VA OMOP: 94%, STARR-OMOP: 57%, CUIMC: 52%), but were majority female in HIRA (56%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 7% to 14%, diabetes from 18% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 22% to 70% across data sources, while between 9% and 39% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to their hospitalisation. Compared to 52,422 individuals hospitalised with influenza, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more likely male, younger, and, in the US, had fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions Rates of comorbidities and medication use are high among individuals hospitalised with COVID-19. However, COVID-19 patients are more likely to be male and appear to be younger and, in the US, generally healthier than those typically admitted with influenza.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burn, Edward; You, Seng Chan; Sena, Anthony; Kostka, Kristin; Abedtash, Hamed; Abrahao, Maria Tereza F.; Alberga, Amanda; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Alshammari, Thamir M; Areia, Carlos; Banda, Juan M; Cho, Jaehyeong; Culhane, Aedin C; Davydov, Alexander; DeFalco, Frank J; Duarte-Salles, Talita; DuVall, Scott L; Falconer, Thomas; Gao, Weihua; Golozar, Asieh; Hardin, Jill; Hripcsak, George; Huser, Vojtech; Jeon, Hokyun; Jing, Yonghua; Jung, Chi Young; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Kaduk, Denys; Kent, Seamus; Kim, Yeesuk; Kolovos, Spyros; Lane, Jennifer; Lee, Hyejin; Lynch, Kristine E.; Makadia, Rupa; Matheny, Michael E.; Mehta, Paras; Morales, Daniel R.; Natarajan, Karthik; Nyberg, Fredrik; Ostropolets, Anna; Park, Rae Woong; Park, Jimyung; Posada, Jose D.; Prats-Uribe, Albert; Rao, Gowtham A.; Reich, Christian; Rho, Yeunsook; Rijnbeek, Peter; Muthu Kumaran Sathappan, Selva; Schilling, Lisa M.; Schuemie, Martijn; Shah, Nigam H.; Shoaibi, Azza; Song, Seokyoung; Spotnitz, Matthew; Suchard, Marc A.; Swerdel, Joel; Vizcaya, David; Volpe, Salvatore; Wen, Haini; Williams, Andrew E; Yimer, Belay B; Zhang, Lin; Zhuk, Oleg; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Ryan, Patrick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20074336v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Columbia University Irving Medical Center","STAnford Medicine Research data Repository","Health Insurance Review \u0026 Assessment"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["COVID","patients","influenza","profile of individuals","VA OMOP","STARR-OMOP","majority male","likely male","data sources","lower medication use","CUIMC","HIRA","South Korea","fewer comorbidities","majority female","STAnford Medicine Research data Repository","Conclusions Rates of comorbidities","Columbia University Irving Medical Center","Assessment","demographics","Health Insurance Review","prior conditions","severe coronavirus disease","Department of Veterans Affairs","characteristics","renin-angiotensin system","days","Age profiles","drugs","Methods","Prevalence of asthma","hypertensive disorder","hospitalisation","Background","Results","diabetes"],"language":"en"},

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danon, Leon; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Bailey, Mick; Keeling, Matt J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05d99c07db59b6948e39bfa62c2cbbf62944059a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Wales","China"],"keyphrases":["person transmission","peak timing","transmission rate","epidemic peak","estimates of peak time","human transmission","England","days","start of person","parameter estimates","Wales","initial estimates","spread of CoVID","improved estimates of epidemiological parameters","absence of control measures","potential course of CoVID","current outbreak","Seasonal changes","China","Results","probable cases of human","total attack rate","model stochasticity","permit investigation of control measures","population sizes","population movement","biological parameters","absence of controls","winter months","minimal impact","realistic parameter uncertainty","existing national-scale metapopulation model","important implications","cost effectiveness analyses","starting location","healthcare capacity planning","countries","census data","novel coronavirus","Methods","Background","Discussion"],"language":"en"},

We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 \u03BCM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 \u03BCM) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals.

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \u0022daily settlement\u0022 (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, \u0022daily settlement\u0022 for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Qing; Wang, Jing; You, Jianling; Zhu, Shida; Zhou, Rui; Tian, Zhijian; Wu, Hao; Lin, Yang; Chen, Wei; Xiao, Lan; Jin, Xin; Li, Jianjuan; Dong, Jie; Wu, Honglong; Zhang, Wei; Li, Jing; Xu, Xun; Yin, Ye; Mu, Feng; Chen, Weijun; Wang, Jian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08e53d107d66c898ad147e0100d3a955e40103ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036624","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Health Commission of Hubei Province"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["daily testing capacity","trends of suspected cases","increment of suspected cases","peak of suspected cases","number of suspected cases","Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data","testing capacity improvement","nucleic acid testing results","new discovered suspected cases","quarantine cost","challenge of limited testing capacity","different nucleic acid testing capacities","standardized clinical testing platform","establishment of Huo","daily settlement","effect of quarantine","unprecedented province-scale quarantine","automated laboratory","public data","empirical data","corresponding cost","week","novel differential model","Health Commission of Hubei Province","mathematical model","novel coronavirus","Hubei lockdown","high-throughput sequencing","non-linear transfer coefficients","control of infectious diseases","early prevention","competitive compartments","great significance","impact","immunoprotein assessment capabilities","achievement","common times","China","Conclusions","turning point","emergencies","Background","duration","COVID","Methods","order","ad","infrastructure","measure","days","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. Materials and Methods A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.

Abstract SARS-CoV2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease-19), was first identified in December 2019. In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency. Because Spain has one of the largest older populations in the world, COVID-19 has emerged as a geriatric emergency.

It is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and uncover potential risk factors for severe disease to reduce the overall mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 93 severe non-ICU patients at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included in this study. Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109/L, of whom 76% (19/25) had a platelet decrease of \u003E50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52.2% (24/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6.7% (1/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81.3% of critical CRRT patients (13/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19. Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease. Exposure to a high dose of heparin may trigger further severe thrombocytopenia with a fatal outcome. An alternative anticoagulant other than heparin should be used to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, X.; Zhang, X.; Xiao, Y.; Gao, T.; Wang, G.; Wang, Z.; Zhang, Z.; Hu, Y.; Dong, Q.; Zhao, S.; Yu, L.; Zhang, S.; Li, H.; Li, K.; Chen, W.; Bian, X.; Mao, Q.; Cao, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/129a24f0574121f32e5bb5bb3495d4ab684e79b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076851v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","PLT","CRRT"],"locations":["Huoshenshan Hospital","China"],"keyphrases":["critical COVID","heparin-naive patients","critical CRRT patients","severe non-ICU patients","heparin exposure","heparin-induced thrombocytopenia","fatal outcomes of COVID","severe thrombocytopenia","high dose of heparin","clinical characteristics of COVID","severe disease","Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies","overall mortality rate of COVID","critical condition","nonsurvivors","high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies","progressive platelet decrease","marker of HIT","spontaneous HIT","platelet counts","PLT","significant decrease","Background Coronavirus infectious disease","Huoshenshan Hospital","related laboratory tests","treatments","demographic","Wuhan","potential risk factors","intensive care unit","China","continuous renal replacement therapy","Medical records","addition","Methods","Findings","50x109","global pandemic","study","baseline","percent"],"language":"en"},

To this end, we describe estimands for outcome types of particular interest in these trials (ordinal and time-to-event). When the outcome is ordinal, the estimands that we consider are the difference between study arms in the mean outcome, the Mann-Whitney (rank--based) estimand, and the average of the cumulative log odds ratios over the levels of the outcome. For time-to-event outcomes, we consider the difference between arms in the restricted mean survival time, the difference between arms in the cumulative incidence, and the relative risk. Advantageously, the interpretability of these estimands does not rely on a proportional odds or proportional hazards assumptions. For each estimand, we evaluate the potential value added by using estimators that leverage information in baseline variables to improve precision and reduce the required sample size to achieve a desired power. These are called covariate adjusted estimators. To evaluate the performance of the covariate adjusted and unadjusted estimators that we present, we simulate two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is ordinal or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital prior to March 28, 2020, and a CDC preliminary description of 2449 cases reported to the CDC from February 12 to March 16, 2020. We focus on hospitalized, COVID-19 positive patients and consider the following outcomes: intubation, ventilator use, and death.

Abstract The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to major organisational changes in health care settings, especially in psychiatric hospitals. We conducted a national online survey to assess the evolution of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the different centres practicing this treatment. 65 responses from all over France were analysed. More than 90 % of the centres practising ECT experienced a decrease in their activity. Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity. Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult. It is essential not to add to this difficulty the complications, often serious, that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice of ECT. It will also be necessary to remain vigilant with regard to the specific neuropsychiatric consequences that will follow the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amad, Ali; Magnat, Ma\u00E9va; Quil\u00E8s, Cl\u00E9lia; Yrondi, Antoine; Sauvaget, Anne; Bulteau, Samuel; Plaze, Marion; Rotharmel, Maud; Polosan, Mircea; L\u00E9vy-Chavagnat, Diane; Jaafari, Nematollah; Vaiva, Guillaume; Thomas, Pierre","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/120be0fd01e641dca4196534ee89340848d72984.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300725; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300725?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["the centres experienced","the centres practising ECT experienced","moiti\u00E9 des centres","quart des centres","diff\u00E9rents centres","to add to this difficulty the complications","Abstract The recent COVID","in the different centres practicing this treatment","pandemic COVID","national online survey to assess the evolution","It will also be necessary to remain vigilant with regard to the specific neuropsychiatric consequences that will follow the pandemic","decrease in their activity","psychiatric care is expected to be difficult","that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice","activit\u00E9 habituelle","soins psychiatriques post-pand\u00E9mie COVID","led to major organisational changes in health care settings","especially in psychiatric hospitals","more than half","their usual activity","arr\u00EAt total","pand\u00E9mie r\u00E9cente","diminution","It is essential","total cessation","lieux de soins","arr\u00EAt de la pratique","over France were analysed","often serious","electroconvulsive therapy","We conducted","responses from","enqu\u00EAte nationale","cons\u00E9quences sp\u00E9cifiques neuropsychiatriques","changements organisationnels majeurs","suite","ligne","hospitalisation","retard","\u00E9volution","psychiatrie","difficult\u00E9","r\u00E9ponses"],"language":"fr"},

For example, currently, Maharashtra has more than 2500 confirmed cumulative infected cases, whereas West Bengal has less than 300 confirmed infected cases (16 April 2020). The approaches to address the pandemic in the two states must be different due to limited resources. In this article, we will focus the infected people in each state (restricting to only those states with enough data for prediction) and build three growth models to predict infected people for that state in the next 30 days.

In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Material: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. Results: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71% respectively). Approximatively 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. Conclusion: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated Kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement). Urologists must anticipate for lockdown exit in order to catch-up delayed surgeries.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinar, Ugo; Anract, Julien; Duquesne, Igor; Dariane, Charles; Chartier-Kastler, Emmanuel; Cussenot, Olivier; Desgrandchamps, Fran\u00E7ois; Hermieu, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Irani, Jacques; de La Taille, Alexandre; M\u00E9jean, Arnaud; Mongiat-Artus, Pierre; Peyromaure, Micha\u00EBl; Barrou, Benoit; Zerbib, Marc; Roupr\u00EAt, Morgan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/305894b2518e07b31d2b4402fafe1b3e6c973b39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1166708720301482; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1166708720301482?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["genital surgical procedures","reduction of urological surgery","non-oncological procedures","non-emergency surgical activity","surgical activity reduction analysis","major families of urological interventions","postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions","Oncology activity","reinstatement of delayed interventions","academic urological departments of Parisians centres","Lockdown","centralized surgical planning software","type of surgery","pandemic","COVID","order","hours of surgery","catch-up delayed surgeries","AP-HP","drastic decrease","day period","Isolated Kidney transplantation","number of kidney transplantations","France","adult","andrological","Procedure title","outpatient ratio","Conclusion","Material","data","national statement","ABSTRACT Introduction","study","emergencies","similar periods","objective","Urologists","Results"],"language":"en"},

We sought to estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States during April 2020 and compare that to the number of expected deaths in the same time period. Methods: The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts that 67,212 COVID-19 deaths will occur during April 2020. To obtain the number of excess COVID-19 deaths, we multiplied published infection fatality rates by age by population numbers to obtain assumed infection rates. We then subtracted the expected number of deaths calculated using life table mortality rates. Results: During April 2020 there may be 61,690 to 62,526 excess deaths. Population infection rates of 3.6% to 4.3% by mid-April 2020 would generate the number of COVID-19 deaths predicted by IHME.

The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R \u002B UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R \u002B UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R \u002B UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Each plasma pool (n=9) underwent R \u002B UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n=3). RESULTS Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were \u2265 4.79 \u00B1 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 \u00B1 0.26 in whole blood units. CONCLUSION Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 \u00B1 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ragan, Izabela; Hartson, Lindsay; Pidcoke, Heather; Bowen, Richard; Goodrich, Raymond P.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0154252500f9a768b814466581c1e346c6fbb334.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lakewood, CO)"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UV treatment","blood units","UV light dose","METHODS SARS-CoV","plasma products","blood donations","blood transfusion","human plasma","Pathogen-reduced blood products","clades of SARS","individual units of plasma","plasma pool","infectious titer of SARS","infectious titers of SARS","blood product quality","ultraviolet light","RESULTS Riboflavin","CONCLUSION Riboflavin","efficacy of R","Exposure","viral titers","limit of detection","COVID","recommended energy dose","Coronavirus Disease","causative agent","viral RNA","Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System","BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Terumo BCT","safer option","manufacturer","triplicate","mean log reductions","plaque assay","pathogens","Lakewood","ill patients","STUDY DESIGN","infectivity","Vero cells","strain","strong immunity","isolate USA-WA1","samples","serum","Logs","high-risk categories","questions","ability","average"],"language":"en"},

Findings: In this epidemiological study based on publicly available data, we develop a model that predicts vulnerability to COVID-19 for each US county in terms of likelihood of going from no documented cases to at least one case within five days and in terms of number of occurrences of the virus. Meaning: Predicting county vulnerability to COVID-19 can assist health organizations to better plan for resource and workforce needs. Abstract Importance: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread. Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. Design: Original Investigation; Decision Analytical Model Study for County Level COVID-19 occurrences using data from March 14-31, 2020. Setting: Disease spread prediction for US counties. Participants: All US county level granularity based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. Exposure(s) (for observational studies): Daily county level reported COVID-19 occurrences from March 14-31, 2020. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3-stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID-19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. Results: Using data from March 14-31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%. Conclusions and Relevance: We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduces significant variation in reported cases and produces a bias in the model.

These regimens were primarily relying on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks, with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blasiak, A.; Lim, J.

Abstract Objective: This review aims to map scientific evidence in nursing care aimed at controlling coronavirus infections. Methods: A bibliographic search was conducted in the Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and WOS main databases, with no date limit and using the keywords \u0022transmission\u0022, \u0022infection\u0022, \u0022contagious\u0022, \u0022spreads\u0022, \u0022coronavirinae\u0022, \u0022coronavirus\u0022, \u0022COVID 19\u0022, \u0022sars cov 2\u0022, \u0022nurses\u0022 and \u0022nursing\u0022. Initially, 154 studies were identified and, after selecting them according to eligibility criteria, 16 were included. Results: Among the main recommendations according to the available evidence are air exchange in rooms as a measure to reduce the risk of infection among patients; reinforcement of measures in intensive care units; follow-up of positive case contacts; and adequate training of professionals. Discussion and conclusions: The studies included in the review addressed infection prevention and control practices by analyzing risks associated with exposure and listing actions to avoid complications in critically ill patients. Patterns of case transmission, contacts and associated factors were identified. Professional knowledge and attitudes were also studied, showing the importance of good infection control training, and of sufficient equipment and adequate infrastructure. Nurses are important vectors of spread. Although there is little evidence available on the effectiveness of care to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, published studies on the prevention and control of previous outbreaks of coronavirus are of considerable value.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brito-Brito, Pedro Ruym\u00E1n; Mart\u00EDnez-Alberto, Carlos Enrique; Cu\u00E9llar-Pompa, Leticia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9127e12d1147afdfc0fbe90f015cdec97ca37ae1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120303041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120303041?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Scopus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reinforcement of","up of","Patterns of","on the prevention and control of previous outbreaks of coronavirus","were identified and","and of sufficient equipment and adequate infrastructure","prevent the spread of SARS","and adequate training of professionals","the risk of infection among patients","limit and using the keywords","the available evidence","included in the review addressed infection prevention and control","of considerable value","showing the importance of good infection control training","Professional knowledge and","Discussion and conclusions","Scopus and WOS main","little evidence available on the effectiveness of care","important vectors of spread","contacts and associated factors were identified","control de infecciones","sars cov","Among the main recommendations according","control de contagios","bibliographic search was conducted in the Medline","were included","transmission","nurses","in intensive care units","by analyzing risks associated with exposure and listing actions","map scientific evidence in nursing care aimed at controlling coronavirus infections","avoid complications in critically ill patients","exchange in rooms as a measure","were also studied","CINAHL","efectividad de cuidados","revisi\u00F3n","estudios incluidos","evidencia disponible","estudios publicados","covid","spreads","contagious","coronavirinae","cuidados enfermeros dirigidos","unidades de cuidados intensivos","casos positivos","seguimiento de contactos","pr\u00E1cticas de prevenci\u00F3n","considerable utilidad","factores asociados","riesgos asociados","adecuada formaci\u00F3n","riesgo de contagio","buena formaci\u00F3n","pacientes cr\u00EDticos","Resumen Objetivo","actitudes profesionales","This review aims","bases de datos Medline","after selecting them according","eligibility criteria","follow","published","evidencias cient\u00EDficas","Although there","brotes anteriores","acciones","refuerzo de medidas","Results","b\u00FAsqueda bibliogr\u00E1fica","Abstract Objective","habitaciones","cabo","Methods","complicaciones","exposici\u00F3n","recomendaciones principales","importancia","colecci\u00F3n principal","equipos suficientes","intercambio de aire","patrones de transmisi\u00F3n","enfermeras","vectores importantes","propagaci\u00F3n","adecuadas infraestructuras","l\u00EDmite de fecha","Discusi\u00F3n","conclusiones","palabras clave","Initially","Resultados","conocimientos","criterios de elegibilidad","M\u00E9todo"],"language":"es"},

Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drugs against ASFVs. How to effectively control the virus is challenging. In this study, we have analyzed all the publicly available ASFV genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes. Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. The genomic diversity of the virus resulted in proteome diversity. Over 250 types of proteins were inferred from the ASFV genomes, among which only 144 were observed in all analyzed viruses. Further analyses showed that the homologous recombination may contribute much to the indels, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. Moreover, two enzymes, which were possibly related to the homologous recombination, i.e., a Lambda-like exonuclease with a YqaJ-like viral recombinase domain, and a DNA topoisomerase II, were found to be conservative in all the analyzed ASFVs. This work highlighted the importance of the homologous recombination in the evolution of the ASFVs, and helped with the strategy development of the prevention and control of the virus.","publish_time":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zhaozhong; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Fan, Yunshi; Cai, Zena; Lu, Congyu; Zhang, Gaihua; Jiang, Taijiao; Tan, Yongjun; Peng, Yousong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7808e4cd470a379b12470833f4a6fc7e1b567c96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/460832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["available ASFV genomes","occurrence of homologous recombination","large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes","adjacent positions of ASFV genomes","indels","genomic diversity","analyzed ASFVs","occurrence of extensive recombination events","proteome diversity","control","analyzed viruses","Recent outbreaks of African swine fever virus","extensive genomic insertions","swine industry","viral recombinase domain","YqaJ","China","significant associations","nucleotides","prevention","deletions","Lambda","Repeated elements of dozens","DNA topoisomerase","strategy development","length","exonuclease","effective vaccine","drugs","cluster","importance","evolution","country","point mutations","work","types of proteins","analyses","study","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

From 3/10/2020-5/1/2020 NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed in 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had negative and 1,019 had positive first day results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to be older, male, African-American or Hispanic, and to have severe disease. Among the patients with initially negative results, 18.6% became positive upon repeat-testing. Only 58.1% of any-time positive patients had a result of \u0022detected\u0022 on the first test. The clinical sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular assays is estimated between 66.2% and 95.6%, depending on the unknown number of false negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to a negative result is unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20-30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Forty-nine initially-positive patients converted to negative and then back to positive in subsequent days. Conversion from first day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same or next 2 days after a negative test in a patient with high suspicion for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, D.

However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression. Results: A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p \u003C0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation. Conclusions: The ongoing outbreak of KD in the Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS and African ancestry.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toubiana, J.; Poirault, C.; Corsia, A.; Bajolle, F.; Fourgeaud, J.; Angoulvant, F.; Debray, A.; Basmaci, R.; Salvador, E.; Biscardi, S.; Frange, P.; Chalumeau, M.; Casanova, J.-L.; Cohen, J.

Few African countries have reported case numbers above one thousand, with South Africa reporting 3,034 cases being hit hardest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about 2.5 days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with 1.14 million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent and the Global South.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schro\u00CC\u0088der, M.; Bossert, A.; Kersting, M.; Aeffner, S.; Coetzee, J.; Timme, M.; Schlu\u00CC\u0088ter, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51b7e089ba0ce16f5e4d7b196093a5046b177c76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20077891v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nelson Mandela"],"organizations":["Hubei/China"],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","South Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["African countries","South Africa reporting","cases","specific interventions","Global South","implications of interventions","Sub-Saharan Africa","African continent","national lockdown","sufficient compliance","strong non-pharmaceutical interventions","subexponential growth","doubling times","COVID","days","fraction of reported patients","initial exponential growth of existing case numbers","mobility model","intervention targets","scenario analysis","human mobility options","pressured national economies","limited health care capacities","current levels of intervention measures","local intensive care capacity","testing capabilities","physical distancing","leisure activities","computational data-driven agent","socio-economic hardships","individual level","Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality","viable option","inhabitants","end","Hubei","large parts","regions","outbreak dynamics","hints","overall effectiveness","contrast","China","required strengths","insufficient length","interests"],"language":"en"},

To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods. Methods: We compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period. Results: Between March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75\u002B. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes. Conclusion: Even though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75\u002B. Only half of the excess mortality was registered as directly due do COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vieira, A.; Peixoto, V.

(2) How concerned are you that you will contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants\u0027 estimates of an impending national health crisis increased significantly during the study\u0027s second week (March 9-12) while concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only marginally during the study\u0027s final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure. However, about 30% of participants perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others. Also, participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events.

Public health authorities now consider it highly likely that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will follow a pattern of seasonal circulation globally. To guide mitigation strategies and tactics in a location-specific manner, accurate simulation of prolonged or intermittent patterns of social/physical distancing is required in order to prevent healthcare systems and communities from collapsing. It is equally important to capture the stochastic appearance of individual transmission events. Traditional epidemiological/statistical models cannot make predictions in a geospatial temporal manner based on human individuals in a community. Thus, the challenge is to conduct spatio-temporal simulations of transmission chains with real-world geospatial and georeferenced information of the dynamics of the disease and the effect of different mitigation strategies such as isolation of infected individuals or location closures. Here, we present a stochastic, geospatially referenced and demography-specific agent-based model with agents representing human beings and include information on age, household composition, daily occupation and schedule, risk factors, and other relevant properties. Physical encounters between humans are modeled in a time-dependent georeferenced network of the population. The model (GERDA-1) can predict infection dynamics under normal conditions and test the effect of different mitigation scenarios such as school closures, reduced social contacts as well as closure or reopening of public/work spaces. Specifically, it also includes the fate and influence of health care workers and their access to protective gear. Key predictions so far entail: (i) the effect of specific groups on the spreading, specifically that children in school contribute substantially to distribution. (ii) the result of reopening society depends crucially on how strict the measures have been during lock-down. (iii) the outcome of reopening is a stochastic process - in the majority of cases, we must expect a second wave, in some cases not. To the best of our best knowledge, the GERDA-1 model is the first model able to predict a bimodal behavior of SARS-Cov-2 infection dynamics. Given the criticality of the global situation, informing the scientific community, decision makers and the general public seems prudent. Therefore, we here provide a pre-print of the GERDA-1 model together with a first set of predictions and analyses as work in progress.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adler, S.

While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic\u0027s magnitude.

Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance, staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh. Methods: We collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study. Results: Out of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives. Conclusions: We found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wadood, Md.

Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients. Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vaseghi, G.; Mansourian, M.; Karimi, R.; Heshmat-Ghahdarijani, K.; Baradaran Mahdavi, S.; Pezeshki, A.; Ataei, B.; Zandifar, A.; Shafaat, O.; Haghjoo Javanmard, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cdd0a98730a1ac4856c95e313f40f389ade4218.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.05.20031518v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cochrane"],"keyphrases":["nCoV patients","corona patients","consolidation","reported prevalence","Ground Glass Opacity GGO","CT findings","rare CT symptoms","CT-scan abnormality","combined results of meta-analysis","published studies","Multiple studies","pooled prevalence of treatment failure","nCoV infection","Heterogeneity","fixed effects meta-analysis model","prevalent clinical symptoms","random-effect model","Cochrane Library","pericardial effusion","pleural effusion","prevalent event","Cochrane Q-test","fever","computing p-values","features of chest computed tomography","databases","scans","essential parts of diagnostic workup","PubMed","Embase","diagnosis","cough","number","Imagery techniques","I2-statics","Study Identification","novel coronavirus","Method","Background","confidence interval","Conclusion","mean age","males","generalized result"],"language":"en"},

For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution.

The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving, as demographic explosion, travel globalization and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. PubMed electronic database was requested for relevant articles linking TB, influenza and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (with a focus on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from the past outbreaks (other coronaviruses), as well as influenza pandemic / seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host\u0027s immune responses, it can be assumed that their harmful synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crisan-Dabija, R.; Grigorescu, C.; Pavel, C.

Abstract Introduction: The overload of the healthcare system and the organisational changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may be having an impact on acute stroke care in the Region of Madrid. Methods: We conducted a survey with sections addressing hospital characteristics, changes in infrastructure and resources, code stroke clinical pathways, diagnostic testing, rehabilitation, and outpatient care. We performed a descriptive analysis of results according to the level of complexity of stroke care (availability of stroke units and mechanical thrombectomy). Results: The survey was completed by 22 of the 26 hospitals in the Madrid Regional Health System that attend adult emergencies, between 16 and 27 April 2020. Ninety-five percent of hospitals had reallocated neurologists to care for patients with COVID-19. The numbers of neurology ward beds were reduced in 89.4% of hospitals; emergency department stroke care pathways were modified in 81%, with specific pathways for suspected COVID-19 infection established in 50% of hospitals; and COVID-19\u2013positive patients with acute stroke were not admitted to neurology wards in 42%. Twenty-four hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy was improved in 10 hospitals, which resulted in a reduction in the number of secondary hospital transfers. The admission of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke was avoided in 45% of hospitals, and follow-up through telephone consultations was implemented in 100%. Conclusions: The organisational changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospitals in the Region of Madrid have modified the allocation of neurology department staff and infrastructure, stroke units and stroke care pathways, diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, and outpatient follow-up.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuentes, Blanca; Alonso de Leci\u00F1ana, Mar\u00EDa; Calleja-Casta\u00F1o, Patricia; Carneado-Ruiz, Joaqu\u00EDn; Egido-Herrero, Jos\u00E9; Gil-N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Antonio; Masju\u00E1n-Vallejo, Jaime; Vivancos-Mora, Jos\u00E9; Rodr\u00EDguez-Pardo, Jorge; Riera-L\u00F3pez, Nicol\u00E1s; Xim\u00E9nez-Carrillo, \u00C1lvaro; Cruz-Culebras, Antonio; G\u00F3mez-Escalonilla, Carlos; D\u00EDez-Tejedor, Exuperio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/360b3fde60935d8ba253608626f8adc669f9586c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320301080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320301080?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resumen","Resultados"],"organizations":["la Comunidad de Madrid","AIT"],"locations":["Madrid"],"keyphrases":["y en","neurolog\u00EDa en","ictus agudo en","complejidad en","modificado los circuitos en urgencias para ictus en","propio hospital en","los hospitales los pacientes","ictus agudo COVID","neurolog\u00EDa y los circuitos","los pacientes y seguimiento","cambios en infraestructura y recursos","ictus-UI y","ingresan en camas","pandemia COVID","acute stroke care","infecci\u00F3n COVID","suspected COVID","minor stroke","Encuesta estructurada en bloques","c\u00F3digo ictus","podr\u00EDan estar repercutiendo en","y se han incorporado consultas telef\u00F3nicas para seguimiento en","emergency department stroke care pathways","availability of stroke units","sobrecarga asistencial y los cambios organizativos frente","pacientes afectados por COVID","outpatient care","percent of hospitals","code stroke clinical pathways","rehabilitaci\u00F3n y atenci\u00F3n ambulatoria","SERMAS que atienden urgencias en adultos","AIT o ictus leve","han modificado","hospital characteristics","hospital admissions","Region of Madrid","reduci\u00E9ndose los traslados interhospitalarios secundarios","circuitos espec\u00EDficos para sospecha","Se han reducido camas","specific pathways","organisational changes","han cedido neur\u00F3logos para atender","infrastructure","pruebas diagn\u00F3sticas","diagnostic testing","ingreso","number of secondary hospital transfers","Se ha evitado","Madrid Regional Health System","admission of patients","positive patients","response","neurology wards","outpatient follow-up","pandemic","survey","allocation of neurology department staff","hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy","disponibilidad o","healthcare system","encuesta entre","Ha mejorado","numbers of neurology ward beds","trombectom\u00EDa mec\u00E1nica-TM","descriptive analysis of results","recursos humanos e infraestructuras","unidades","caracter\u00EDsticas","dedicaci\u00F3n","resources","cumplimentaron","positivos","transient ischaemic attack","nivel","rehabilitation","realizaci\u00F3n","acceso","tratamiento","level of complexity","An\u00E1lisis descriptivo seg\u00FAn","Comunidad","adult emergencies","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","reallocated neurologists","overload","M\u00E9todos","reduction","sections","impact","infection","Conclusiones","telephone consultations","Abstract Introduction","Conclusions","abril","Resultados","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Iran was one of the first countries outside of China to report infections with COVID-19. With nearly 100 exported cases to various other countries, it has since been the epicentre of the outbreak in the Middle east. By examining the age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates across the country and 14 university hospitals in Tehran, we find that, in younger age groups, the reported cases on 13/03/2020 only capture less than 10% of symptomatic cases in the population. This indicates significant levels of under-reporting in Iran. Using the 18 full-genome sequences from cases with a travel history or link to Iran, as well as the one full genome sequence obtained from within the country, we estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor of sequences which suggests the likely start of the outbreak on 21/01/2020 (95% HPD: 05/12/2019 - 14/02/2020) with an approximate doubling time of 3.07 (95% HPD: 1.68 - 16.27). Also, based on known exported cases to Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, and China, we estimate the outbreak size on 25 February and 6 March to be around 13,700 (95% CI: 7,600 - 33,300) and 60,500 (43,200 - 209,200), respectively. Knowing the size of the outbreak at two time points and the typical doubling times associated with the COVID-19 epidemics in countries across Europe and North America, we can independently verify that the likely start of epidemic in Iran is around 15/01/2020 (27/12/2019 - 24/01/2020). Our assessment of the fate of the epidemic based on current levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented by the government suggests upward of 10 million cases (IQR: 6.7M - 18M) and 100,000 ICU beds required (IQR: 77K - 140K) during the peak of the epidemic with more than 100,000 cumulative deaths (IQR: 180K - 240K). We also predict a peak in demand for ICU beds on 21/04/2020 (IQR: 06/04/2020 - 23/05/2020). The large span of the peak of the ICU demand is a result of two separate peaks, with the first occurring at around 15/4/2020 and the second in approximately a months time. The latter is also expected to last longer and is based on the relatively relaxed social distancing measures in place. The exact magnitude and timing of the peaks strictly depends on levels of interventions and can change significantly upon new information or change of policy. We caution that a lack of, or relaxed, stringent intervention measures, during a period of highly under-reported spread, would likely lead to the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed in the next few months.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghafari, Mahan; Hejazi, Bardia; Karshenas, Arman; Dascalu, Stefan; Ferretti, Luca; Ledda, Alice; Katzourakis, Aris","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070904v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China","Middle east","Iran","Lebanon","Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["reported cases","exported cases","Iran","IQR","symptomatic cases","outbreak size","countries","China","months time","time points","levels of interventions","ICU demand","ICU beds","age-stratified COVID","approximate doubling time","country","genome sequences","under-reported spread","HPD","significant levels of under-reporting","current levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions","relaxed social distancing measures","separate peaks","stringent intervention measures","typical doubling times","younger age groups","recent common ancestor of sequences","period","case fatality rates","travel history","Kuwait","Europe","place","Oman","government","epidemics","result","Lebanon","link","Coronavirus Disease","university hospitals","North America","exact magnitude","timing","Tehran","fate","cumulative deaths","infections","new information","Middle east","large span","healthcare system","policy","lack","assessment","epicentre","population","world"],"language":"en"},

The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. Methods We obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. Results Kenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. Conclusion The 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north.

Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary patternthat led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity. Highlights Orthocoronavirinae genome phylogeny revealed that bat, pangolin and anteater are natural reservoir hosts of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2). Host-specific adaptive mutation occurred among the coronaviruses. Transmission of 2019-nCoV to human took place by inter-intra species mode of transmission.

The clinical symptoms of severe and non-severe patients vary, and the case-fatality rate (CFR) in severe COVID-19 patients is very high. However, the information on the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 and of their prognostic potential is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome data were collected and analyzed from 223 COVID-19 patients stratified into 125 non-severe patients and 98 severe patients. In addition, a pooled large-scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases was performed. RESULTS: We found that the age, gender and comorbidities are the common risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. For the diagnosis markers, we found that the levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in severe group compared with the non-severe group on admission (D-Dimer: 87.3% vs. 35.3%, P\u003C0.001; CRP, 65.1% vs. 13.5%, P\u003C0.001; LDH: 83.9% vs. 22.2%, P\u003C0.001; PCT: 35.1% vs. 2.2%, P\u003C0.001), while the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) and creatinine kinase (CK) were only mildly increased. We also made a large scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases combined with 4 related literatures, and further confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 severity and these risk factors. Moreover, we tracked dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19, and found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in high levels in severe patient. Among all these markers, D-dimer increased remarkably in severe patients and mostly related with the case-fatality rate (CFR). We found adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis markers CRP, D-dimer, LDH and PCT are associated with severity of COVID-19. Among these markers, D-dimer is sensitive for both severity and CFR of COVID-19. Treatment with heparin or other anticoagulants may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Y.; Lyu, X.; Li, D.; Wang, Y.; Wang, L.; Zou, W.; Wei, Y.; Wu, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2267bdcf351231fdafbab20717a3aa04b69385bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070656v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dimer"],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","severity of COVID","non-severe patients","CFR of COVID","D-Dimer","process of COVID","non-severe group","levels of D","clinical symptoms of severe","LDH","PCT","diagnosis markers CRP","high levels","common risk factors","cases","case-fatality rate","levels of aspartate aminotransferase","adjuvant antithrombotic treatment","clinical characteristics","pooled large-scale meta-analysis","large scale meta-analysis","related literatures","laboratory findings","C-reactive protein","lactate dehydrogenase","good therapeutic effect","comorbidities","procalcitonin","admission","creatinine kinase","retrospective study","gender","outcome data","addition","anticoagulants","public emergency","worldwide pandemic","age","cohort","heparin","dynamic changes","BACKGROUND","Coronavirus Disease","CONCLUSIONS","relationship","METHODS","information","prognostic potential","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.","publish_time":"2002-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viuff, Birgitte; Tj\u00F8rneh\u00F8j, Kirsten; Larsen, Lars E.; R\u00F8ntved, Christine M.; Uttenthal, \u00C5se; R\u00F8nsholt, Leif; Alexandersen, Soren","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcfd694c69f4de1816058997a5d68fe0b0d0d773.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010644963; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010644963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory epithelial cells","T cells","Human respiratory syncytial virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","Replication of BRSV","BRSV-infected epithelial cells","model of respiratory syncytial virus infection","upper respiratory tract","lower respiratory tract","Neighboring cells","BRSV-infected apoptotic cells","experimental BRSV infection","important cause of severe respiratory disease","primary infection","course of infection","important aspects of viral replication","important way of clearance","calves","apoptosis","bronchi","indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell","mediated cytotoxicity","infections","young children","elderly","neutrophils","natural target animal","pneumovirus","CD4","CD8","epidemiological characteristics","study","lumen","immunocompromised adults","number","viruses"],"language":"en"},

MedRxiv is a recently launched free online repository for preprints in the health sciences. We sought to summarize potential benefits and risks to preprint server use, from both the researcher and end-user perspective, and evaluate the uptake of preprint servers in the nephrology community. Sources of Information: We performed a rapid review of articles describing preprint servers and their use. We approached the 20 highest impact nephrology journals regarding their policy towards the use of preprint servers. We evaluated the average time from study completion to publication of impactful articles in nephrology. Finally, we evaluated the number of nephrology articles submitted to preprint servers. Findings: To date over 600 kidney-related articles have been uploaded to bioRxiv and medRxiv. The average time from study completion to publication was over 10 months. 16 of the top 20 nephrology journals currently accept research submitted to a preprint server. Transparency and collaboration, visibility and recognition, and rapid dissemination of results were identified as benefits of preprint servers. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of non-peer reviewed medical research being publicly available. Limitations: Preprint servers remain a recent phenomenon in health sciences and their long-term impact on the medical literature remains to be seen.

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity. OBJECTIVES/METHODS The LIAISON\u00AE SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (\u003E1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis. RESULTS The LIAISON\u00AE SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at \u003E5 or \u226515 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was \u003C5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON\u00AE SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests/hour. The test also provides a semiquantitative measure to identify samples with neutralizing antibodies, useful also for a large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use. IMPORTANCE With the worldwide advance of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient, reliable and accessible diagnostic tools are needed to support public health officials and healthcare providers in their efforts to deliver optimal medical care, and articulate sound demographic policy. DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonelli, Fabrizio; Sarasini, Antonella; Zierold, Claudia; Calleri, Mariella; Bonetti, Alice; Vismara, Chiara; Blocki, Frank; Pallavicini, Luca; Chinali, Alberto; Campisi, Daniela; Percivalle, Elena; DiNapoli, Anna Pia; Perno, Carlo Federico; Baldanti, Fausto","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0305cf8bca09e565d9522863245af670ebc7aa66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.105445","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralizing assay","S2 IgG assay","SARS-CoV","SARS CoV","Assay performance","standardized automated chemiluminescent assay","S2 proteins","native S1","measurement of IgG specific","large numbers of samples","large amounts of samples","residual samples","high levels of neutralizing antibodies","neutralizing activity","automated LIAISON","prediction of neutralizing capacity","plasma levels of anti-S1","clinical performance","pandemic","selective serological testing","automated serology","analytical performance","negative Covid","diagnostic sensitivity","diagnosis","results","specificity","tests","large scale screening of convalescent plasma","safe therapeutic use","precise serological testing","high titer convalescent sera","Italian health care professionals","different cut-offs","prophylactic use","excellent sensitivity","optimal medical care","public health officials","semiquantitative measures of serum","non-infected individuals","accessible diagnostic tools","efforts","donors","collaboration","healthcare providers","articulate sound demographic policy","settings","predictive values","exposure","Spike protein","throughput","minutes","laboratory","observational study","true immune status of subjects","METHODS","disease prevalence","pressing need","worldwide advance","guidance","OBJECTIVES","unknown quality","variable speed","IMPORTANCE","hour","DiaSorin","BACKGROUND","average imprecision","virus","coefficient of variation","days","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Clinical series and testing cohorts based upon screening of symptomatic cases provide biased estimates of susceptibility in children. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour. Methods We undertook a rapid systematic review of contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? We searched PubMed and medRxiv on 16 May 2020 and identified 6327 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references (2) and professional contacts (4). We assessed quality, summarized findings and undertook a random effects meta-analysis of contact-tracing studies. Results 18 studies met inclusion criteria; 9 contact-tracing, 8 population-screening and 1 systematic-review. Meta-analysis of contact tracing studies showed that the pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults for all contact tracing studies was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69) with substantial heterogeneity (63%). Findings from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) were due to a child index case and a population-based school contact tracing study found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and not suitable for meta-analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and an Italian municipal study showed markedly lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence amongst children and young people, however studies from Stockholm, England and municipalities in Switzerland and Germany showed showed no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children. Conclusions There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viner, R. M.; Mytton, O. T.; Bonell, C.; Melendez-Torres, G. J.; Ward, J.

However, it is impaired by high costs, logistic issues and high risk of exposure. Chest x-ray (CXR) is a low-cost, low-risk, not time consuming technique and is emerging as the recommended imaging modality to use in COVID-19 pandemic. This technique, although less sensitive than CT-scan, can provide useful information about pulmonary involvement. Purpose To describe chest x-ray features of COVID-19 pneumonia and to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique in detecting pneumonia. A further scope is to assess the effectiveness of a post-processing algorithm in improving lung lesions detectability. Materials and Methods 72 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 underwent bedside chest X-ray. Two radiologists were asked to express their opinion about: (i) presence of pneumonia (negative or positive); (ii) localization (unilateral or bilateral); (iii) topography (according to pulmonary fields); (iv) density (non consolidative ground-glass or inhomogeneous opacities; consolidative nodulartype or triangular; mixed consolidative e non-consolidative); and (v) presence of pleural effusion. The point (i) was evaluated separately, while the other points in consensus. A quality assessment of post-processed x-ray images was performed by two different readers. Results The agreement about presence of pneumonia was almost perfect with K value of 0.933 and p \u003C 0.001. Sensitivity was 69%. The following findings were seen: unilateral lung involvement in 50%; lower lung lesions in 54%; peripheral distribution in 48%; and non-consolidative pattern in 44%. Post-processed images improved the detection of lesions in 7 out 72 patients ({cong}10%) Conclusion CXR owns a good sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 lung involvement.

However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in those municipalities. In this ecological study, we use geographical models of population mobility as patterns for spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Based on surveillance data, we identify two patterns: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area and other that is hierarchical, with long-distance spread through major highways to cities of regional relevance. We also modelled the impact of social distancing strategies in the most relevant cities, and estimated a beneficial effect in each and every setting studied.

Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. METHODS We estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models. RESULTS On an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14, SD 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% likely to be infected at peak time of incidence. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lathika Rajendrakumar, Aravind; Thakarakkattil Narayanan Nair, Anand; Nangia, Charvi; Kumar Chourasia, Prabal; Kumar Chourasia, Mehul; Ghouse Syed, Mohammad; Sasidharan Nair, Anu; B Nair, Arun; Fazaludeen Koya, Muhammed Shaffi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baa3d842929973c1fb011b51fd118c5b63fec172.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND India","SIRD"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["R0","mean time","doubling time of SARS","SARS-CoV","peak time of incidence","time dependent reproductive number","BACKGROUND India","peak of SARS","days","Daily epidemic growth rate of India","SIRD models","different methods","crowd sourced time series data","epidemic growth trajectory","Basic Reproductive Number","mean serial interval","serial intervals","early phase","infectious disease research","standard SIR models","high burden states","SBM","Rt","deaths","Sequential Bayesian method","explosion of cases","fund","simulation","countries","air travel","epidemiologic studies","individuals","social mixing resumes","efficient tools","vaccine","strict measures","control","recovery","local cluster transmissions","suggestive of community transmission","medicine","need","pattern","SD","RESULTS","average","index case","CONCLUSIONS","current gains","phased manner","normal levels","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. Objectives: We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Methods: Actual data on to COVID-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Discussion: Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, confirmed that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated 6 April) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fattorini, D.; Regoli, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4485c60dcbe0ec4d279f1f5a7a96e094e01ab75d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076455v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Italian provinces","Italian regions","atmospheric pollution","Long-term air-quality data","chronic air pollution","possible influence of air quality","atmospheric contamination","chronicity of exposure","chronic exposure","Northern Italy","Italy of SARS","corresponding long-term air quality evaluations","years","distribution of atmospheric pollutants","terms of chronicity","Actual data","cases of Covid","days","environmental pollution","initial outbreak","Northern areas","additional evidence","severity of cases","possible interactions","regulatory limits","spread viral infection","anomalous variability of SARS","human health protection","high incidence of respiratory","sustainable development","diffusion","prevention of epidemic spreads","O3","NO2","Pro-inflammatory responses","integrated approach","favourable context","clear regional trend","PM2","cardiac affections","frequency","China","PM10","role","geographical differences","coronavirus","concentrations","Methods","particulate matters","multiple factors","European agencies","elaborations","capability","Background","Objectives","Discussion","decade"],"language":"en"},

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with serious threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed to review the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L alternate receptor and phosphorylated subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny including \u0022cytokine storm\u0022 prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popa, I.

The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results\uFF1A Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43\uFF0884.3%\uFF09patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan\uFF0Cand 4\uFF087.7%\uFF09 patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4\uFF087.7%\uFF09 patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]).

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.

The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Findings Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. Interpretation We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iannone, Primiano; Castellini, Greta; Coclite, Daniela; Napoletano, Antonello; Fauci, Alice; Iacorossi, Laura; D\u0027Angelo, Daniela; Renzi, Cristina; La Torre, Giuseppe; Mastroianni, Claudio; Gianola, Silvia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dbe0bf40117cd7538246e63c3536bd652f60752.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054841","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Protecting Health Care Workers","ECDC","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["favour of N95 respirators","HCWs protection","clinical respiratory infections","protective effect of N95 respirators","respiratory viral infections","confirmed COVID","low quality of evidence","low quality evidence","laboratory","surgical masks","use of respiratory filters","RCTs","direct high quality evidence","prevention of COVID","catastrophic SARS-CoV","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus","patients","pandemic","CI","routine care of suspected","Health Care Workers","conflicting guidelines","development","resilience of healthcare systems","bacterial colonization","randomized controlled trials","assessment","PubMed","Embase","Cochrane Library","RR","Background","paramount importance","evaluation","grading of recommendations","inception","ECDC","Interpretation","influenza","illness","trend","best strategy","GRADE","Methods","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3\u2032 tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Setting: Summary-level genetic association data. Participants: Participants were predominantly of European ancestry. Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants). Main outcomes and measures: Lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and plasma ACE2 levels. Results: There were no association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with any of the outcomes considered here. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in GTEx (p = 4x10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in INTERVAL (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations between genetically predicted levels of the other cardiometabolic traits with the outcomes. Conclusions: This study does not provide evidence to support that ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drugs affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression or plasma ACE2 levels. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our findings do not support a change in ACE inhibitor medication use without clinical justification.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gill, D.; Arvanitis, M.; Carter, P.; Hernandez Cordero, A.

We established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in early life. In the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 may predispose the neonatal population to more severe infection during sepsis. In a neonatal sepsis model, systemic IL-27 levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27 expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with increased mortality that was improved in WSX-1-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor. Infected WSX-1-/- pups exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. IL-27 signaling in WT mice promoted increased bacterial burdens and systemic inflammation compared to WSX-1-/- neonates. This was consistent with more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2\u002B myeloid cells and macrophages from WSX-1-deficient compared to wild-type neonates. Live animal imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in neonates while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 promotes inflammation during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis. IMPORTANCE A number of differences in the neonatal immune response compared with adults have been well described. However, a mechanistic understanding of what needs to be overcome in the neonate to generate a more protective immune response during acute bacterial infection has been limited. The work described here helps fill the gap of what is necessary to overcome in order to achieve improved host response to infection. To further the novelty, IL-27 has not previously been attributed to dysfunction or deficiency in neonatal immunity. Our results enhance the understanding of IL-27 biology in the neonatal population while providing evidence that elevated IL-27 levels limit a protective immune response and are detrimental during neonatal sepsis. Strategies aimed at targeting circulating IL-27 concentrations early in life have the potential to improve control of bacterial infection in neonates.","publish_time":"2019-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seman, Brittany G.; Vance, Jordan K.; Rawson, Travis W.; Witt, Michelle R.; Huckaby, Annalisa B.; Povroznik, Jessica M.; Bradford, Shelby D.; Barbier, Mariette; Robinson, Cory M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/777839","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Increased IL","systemic IL","elevated IL","understanding of IL","functional IL","increased levels of IL","neonatal immune response","abundant producers of IL","bacterial sepsis","impact of elevated early life IL","neonatal population","neonatal sepsis model","neonatal immunity","control of bacterial infection","severe infection","acute bacterial infection","protective immune response","WT neonates","increased bacterial burdens","improved host response","inflammatory response","increased risk","increased mortality","systemic inflammation","wild-type neonates","Infected WSX","efficient bacterial killing","immune suppressive cytokine interleukin","myeloid cells","WT mice","suppressed inflammation","results","myeloid cell profiling","improved weight gain","tissue sources of cytokine","present work","mechanistic understanding","Peripheral tissue analysis","result of immature immunity","expression","susceptibility","pups","Ly6B","potential","evidence","reduced morbidity","infectious outcomes","number of differences","Gr","macrophages","concentrations","order","biology","therapeutic target","F4","targeting","dysfunction","deficiency","adults","Live animal imaging","IMPORTANCE","gap","report","contrast","findings","Strategies","receptor","novelty"],"language":"en"},

Los Angeles has been one of the first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March 4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving--among the others--social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) models. The article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. The analyses have been updated bi-weekly (up to March 16\\ts{th} and up to March 28\\ts{th} 2020) to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and hard interventions to shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment. The results show that overall crime in Las Angeles is significantly decreasing, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft and battery. No significant effect has been found for stolen vehicle, burglary, assault with deadly weapon, intimate partner violence and homicide. In the last section of this article, policy implications are also discussed.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campedelli, Gian Maria; Aziani, Alberto; Favarin, Serena","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0a1f467b954bebb098b8fc5bf9c68e1c69aee1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11021v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Las Angeles"],"keyphrases":["crime trends","overall crime","urban crime categories","pattern theories of crime","Los Angeles","Las Angeles","article","new coronavirus containment policies","public gatherings","urban mobility","coronavirus family","public data","hard interventions","new virus","structural modification","daily activities","social distancing","stronger policies","social phenomena","different sets of measures","Bayesian structural time-series","deadly weapon","assault","metropolis","impact","prohibition of crowded private","local governments","habits","intimate partner violence","micro-level interactions","routine activity","stolen vehicle","burglary","BSTS","work","closure of leisure premises","short-term effects of mild","homicide","citizens","nCoV","light","United States","robbery","shoplifting","theft","battery","models","policy implications","section","results","state of emergency","significant effect","analyses","bi-weekly","global spread","cities","environment","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China. Methods: In this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter [\u2264] 2.5 m (PM2.5) and [\u2264] 10 m (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results. Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 g/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days.

Collaboration between researchers, public health workers and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate that is able to show the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity. Moreover, it allows to carry out short-term predictions and long-term estimations that may facilitate policy decisions and the revision of in-place confinement measures and the development of new protocols. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several Chinese provinces and from other countries with a successful containment of the disease. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity between countries. In countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, model predictions provide a reliable picture of its short-term evolution and may permit to unveil some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to short-term hospital and Intensive Care Units (ICU) requirements, which together with the equivalent predictions on mortality provide key information for health officials.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catala, M.; Alonso, S.; Alvarez Lacalle, E.; Lopez, D.; Cardona, P.-J.; Prats, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b80d5400654bf37668cc9f205d30ce2f2436d5f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20101329v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gompertz"],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["short-term predictions","model predictions","short-term evolution","countries","cumulative cases of Covid","short-term hospital","equivalent predictions","short-term future trends","researchers","long-term evolution","fast spreading","velocity","Gompertz model","health officials","analysis of trends","long-term estimations","dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases","public health workers","place confinement measures","effect of control measures","Intensive Care Units","mortality","key information","current state","reliable picture","ICU","requirements","revision","epidemiology","outbreak","development of new protocols","policy decisions","Collaboration","politicians","systematic differences","initial stages","decrease","growth rate","important contribution","successful containment","Chinese provinces","appearance","international community","disease","Results","characteristics","way","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and/or deployment. A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT\u0027s Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks\u0027 filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cramer, A.; Tian, E.; Yu, S.

OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN Diagnostic model based on retrospective case series. SETTING Two hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China. PTRTICIPANTS 584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020. METHODS LASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram. RESULTS Six potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p[\u2264]0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963 to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified into the CIAAD scale. CONCLUSIONS We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in emergency department to distinguish COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients. The algorithm based on CIAAD scale will help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, B.; Wei, Y.; Sun, W.; Qin, C.; Zhou, X.; Wang, Z.; Li, T.; Cao, H.; Wang, W.; Wang, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc80e8daaa793db15b1c9fa8b8dc7482a3425dd7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20071019v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["CIAAD nomogram","infectious acute abdomen patients","CIAAD scale","Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment","potential COVID","surgeons","prediction model","simplified screening scale","multivariable logistic regression analysis","decision curve analysis","calibration curves","C-index","predication model","validation cohort","training cohort","effective screening model","DESIGN Diagnostic model","potential predictors","algorithm","AUC","clinical impact curves","METHODS LASSO regression","C-reactive protein","independent predictors","emergency department","emergency operation","prediction variables","leukocytes","WBC","DCA","fever","characteristic","chest computed tomography","coronavirus disease","white blood cells","good discrimination","CRP","receiver","variable abdominal pain","retrospective case series","procalcitonin","PCT","laboratory","epidemic","overmuch weight","hospitals","Wuhan","Beijing","China","SARS-CoV","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","IMPORTANCE","PTRTICIPANTS","to15","OBJECTIVE","performance"],"language":"en"},

As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus. | Methods: We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via multidimensional scaling. | Findings: After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global/local social/economic influences, accounting for 32.6%, 16.6%, 11.8% of the collected reports respectively. | Interpretation: The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society than on individuals.

Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Le Van; Ngoc, Nghiem My; That, Bui Thi Ton; Uyen, Le Thi Tam; Hong, Nguyen Thi Thu; Dung, Nguyen Thi Phuong; Nhu, Le Nguyen Truc; Thanh, Tran Tan; Man, Dinh Nguyen Huy; Phong, Nguyen Thanh; Hien, Tran Tinh; Truong, Nguyen Thanh; Thwaites, Guy; Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acab2224003dfbeb25252b59017e0692f9a975bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Vietnam","China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","throat","patient management","infection control","duration of viral shedding","duration of viral detection","live SARS-CoV","important implications","Ho Chi Minh City","Tropical Diseases","real time RT-PCR","RNA","long periods","fecal-oral transmission","patients","rectum","rectal swabs","Vietnam","day","finding","results","China","rapid spread of coronavirus disease","concern","clinical recovery","Knowledge","stool sample","global pandemic","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

In comparison to other RNA viruses the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, however given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for mutations that might compromise these tests. Here we report the identification of a C-to-T transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 E-gene assay. This variant was detected in four health care workers from the same team. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all four to carry genetically identical viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently on three occasions. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of SNPs which might adversely affect the RT-PCRs used in diagnostics.

This is based on the idea that, in k-shell decomposition, weak ties and strong ties are processed separately. The strategy was used on empirical networks constructed from online social networks, and results indicated that this strategy is more accurate than other strategies. Its effectiveness stems from the patterns of connectivity among neighbors, and it successfully identified the important nodes.

The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Neha; Shankar, Uma; Majee, Prativa; Kumar, Amit","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f196a2c87a747cb03adee9b609d7d5c367e749a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","Spain"],"keyphrases":["high efficacy","high expression","high affinity","high propensity","high antigenicity","high population coverage","high mutation rate","detrimental SARS-CoV","multi-epitope vaccine candidate","efficacious protective vaccine","stable vaccine product","Novel SARS coronavirus","rapid generation","protective solution","COVID","infection","generation vaccinology approach","generation of innate immunity","strong immunological memory response","non-toxic epitopes","silico expression","infectious virus","prophylactic solution","immunological receptor TLR3","various parts of China","Various physiochemical analyses","deadly infectious agent","cellular mediated immune response","non-allergen","formation","easy purification","Italy","initial platform","plausibility","strain","public health emergency of International concern","Spain","RNA genome","safety","humans","screening","present study","USA","community transmission","codon optimization","different adjuvants","pandemic condition world-wide","short span of time","proteome"],"language":"en"},

Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Xiang; Ma, Xudong; Hong, Na; Su, Longxiang; Ma, Yingying; He, Jie; Jiang, Huizhen; Liu, Chun; Shan, Guangliang; Zhu, Weiguo; Zhang, Shuyang; Long, Yun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0185f63fd6ecdf04829a155f4d7f62a5b532f06d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR","SERI"],"locations":["South Korea","Iran","France","Germany","Spain","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Epidemic prediction results","model predictions","epidemic trends","adjusted SERI model results","different model outputs","different model inputs","smaller epidemic size","adjusted SEIR model","basic SEIR model","basic SERI model","logistic growth model","scenarios of epidemic development","countries short-term prediction results","rapid deceleration of epidemic development","different models","peak time of COVID","peak predictions","high-risk countries","different mathematical models","effects of public health interventions","initial quarantine time","quarantine scale","public self-protection behaviors","possible spread size","length","transmission dynamics of COVID","measurement of public intervention strategies","sufficient implementation of quarantine","important factors","number of cases","multiple methods","objective conclusions","outbreak of coronavirus disease","quick detection of cases","control measures","Iran","Spain","France","Germany","differences","South Korea","intent","contact rate","epidemiological data","comparative assessment","Italy","paper","Japan","operation suggestions","sudden case","deep concern","Background","severe outbreaks","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p\u003C0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited. By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%). Multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients (relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46)Logistic regression model showed that higher AMH as a control for age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146, 95%CI= (0.026-0.824) p=0.029). E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR=0.335, 95%CI= (0.105-1.070), p=0.046).In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in severe group (p=0.040, 0.033).The higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points(p\uFF1C0.001,\uFF1C0.001, =0.009, = 0.040).E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNF\u03B1 in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19.

Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Potluri, Rahul; Lavu, Deepthi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/707211c1510a7a9405c1faaaa3fae36da1951013.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","number of tests","highest number of COVID","number of diagnostic tests","test rates","highest testing rates","eventual COVID","data","testing rates impact","different countries","real time COVID","increasing number of patients","deaths","lowest death rates","Country wise population level pandemic projections","predicted projections","future projections","projected pandemic outcomes","BST","information","important denominator","main denominator","extrapolated utilising","models","inherent case","proportion","early indication","reference website Worldometer","hospitals","tip","social instability","mortality rate","rapid increase","outbreak","iceberg","havoc","parameters","South Korea","Coronavirus disease","large scale","way","research"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (MLSim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data. Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China\u0027s mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China\u0027s mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12. Conclusions: Machine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Yang; Liu, Yu-Ren; Luo, Fan-Ming; Tu, Wei-Wei; Zhan, De-Chuan; Yu, Guo; Zhou, Zhi-Hua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6b64b4e0ccb80de9dc97825c4e7e0a327c660b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20068072v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MLSim"],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["undetected asymptomatic patients","number of asymptomatic patients","learned MLSim","number of asymptomatic infections","numbers of asymptomatic","virus containment","potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections","date of containment measures","infectious patients","containment strength","virus transmission","data of China\u0027s mainland","undetected ones","decision-making of balanced containment measures","real data","approach of machine learning","machine learning techniques","undetected pool of COVID","self-healed patients","inferred total infections","infectious cases","open Chinese global epidemic data","LSTM-based prediction models","virtual transmission dynamics","complex real-world disease transmission process","disease progress","fine-grained simulators","great risk","multiple practical factors","better forecast accuracy","cross-region population movement","incubation period","SEIR","prevention","undetermined parameters","Findings","Conclusions","government","Mounting evidence","Background","Methods","interactions","spread","Italy","Germany","USA","France","UK","days"],"language":"en"},

The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination. It has been clearly documented that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals. One cannot estimate mortality rates without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population. This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals so they can be properly treated, monitored and tracked. However, accurate estimation of the infection rate, locally, geographically and nationally is important independently. These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state, national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society. The decisions facing policy makers are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic where the infection rate is low, middle stages where the rate is rapidly climbing, and later stages where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate. In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods to both estimate infection rates and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates. These estimates may provide significant cost reductions for testing in rural communities, third world countries and other situations where the cost of testing is expensive or testing is not widely available. As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beigel, R.; Kasif, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/393df9f3bd2b9ab0e100ab48688cebc9e86c5a60.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110585v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection rate estimates","actual infection rate","policy makers","low infection rates","sustainable rate","accurate estimate","cost of testing","mortality rates","number of infected individuals","world level","world countries","early stages","mortality risk","middle stages","later stages","accurate assessment","accurate estimation","emerging epidemic","epidemic curve","significant cost reductions","better management of risk","rural communities","populations","biomedical community","new solutions","state","trends","efficient pooling methods","line of work","situations","medical professionals","profound impact","loss of life","culture","paper","resilience","society","levels","decisions","Pandemics","response","imagination","wave","genetics","need"],"language":"en"},

Patients were recruited from emergency and infectious disease departments and were divided into a training and a validation cohort. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. The pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We then explain the ways in which formal mathematical models in general, and game theoretical models in particular, can help analyze the dynamics of collective action, detect the core parameters through which they evolve and, in particular, identify the interactions between these parameters. We show that these dynamics may have different forms of development, which are usually non-linear and cyclic.

Very little research exists on the effects of social distancing measures on this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of government implemented social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in the United States on a state level, and in the 25 most populated cities, while adjusting for socio-demographic risk factors. The social distancing variables assessed in this study were: days to closing of non-essential business; days to stay home orders; days to restrictions on gathering, days to restaurant closings and days to school closing. Using negative binomial regression, adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing two levels of a binary variable: above median value, and median value and below for days to implementing a social distancing measure. For city level data, the effects of these social distancing variables were also assessed in high (above median value) vs low (median value and below) population density cities. For the state level analysis, days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days. Some results were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. This finding is likely due to reverse causality, where locations with slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures, and later implemented measures when they absolutely needed to respond to increasing rates of infection. Effects of social distancing measures seemed to vary by population density in cities. Our results suggest that the effect of social distancing measures may differ between states and cities and between locations with different population densities. States and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, with an awareness of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. In an effort to reduce infection rates, cities may want to implement social distancing in advance of state mandates.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krishnamachari, B.; Dsida, A.; Zastrow, D.; Harper, B.; Morris, A.; Santella, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b05db36ee30b1632633859dea3470e6c55c49d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110460v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["days","effects of social distancing measures","social distancing variables","effect of social distancing measures","median value","population density cities","populated cities","cumulative incidence rates of COVID","rates of infection","infection rates","effects of government","school closing","state level analysis","non-essential business","locations","restrictions","United States","slower growth rates","socio-economic variables","study","results","adjusted rate ratios","different population densities","advance of state mandates","city level data","effective containment methods","inverse associations","reverse causality","vs low","home orders","restaurant closings","negative binomial regression","individual approaches","confidence intervals","terms of crowding","structure","levels","assessment","epidemic","binary variable","gatherings","socio-demographic risk factors","awareness","finding","effort","pandemic","little research","SARS-CoV","virus","world","purpose"],"language":"en"},

A multicenter retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 574 Spanish COVID-19 inpatients (59.4% males) and their outcomes was performed. 27.7% cases presented a mild curse, 42% a moderate one and 30.3%, severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63.2). Interleukin 6 was higher as increasing severity. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19 and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was associated with moderate or mild disease courses. Clinical course of the disease is more severe in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension or diabetes, were also higher. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for immune system effectors severity-related hampering.

Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. We used historical cohort data from multiple hospitals. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P \u2265.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P \u2265.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). Therefore, we recommend analyzing the presence/absence of transmission. The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo\u0027s exact test. The total sample size for the 1st and 2nd stage is N =100 pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were relatively common (\u22651.0% of cases) and had expected incidence \u22650.20 infections per 8 hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed \u224517% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms. In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample sizes for using S. aureus transmission within and between pairs of successive cases in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dexter, Franklin; Ledolter, Johannes; Wall, Russell T.; Datta, Subhradeep; Loftus, Randy W.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72b3e073943fe60bc496803774bf4e08520f1040.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405603020300303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405603020300303?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aureus transmission","pairs of cases","absence of transmission","pairs of successive cases","pairs of successive surgical cases","value of targeting surveillance of transmission","sampled pair of cases","hours of sampled cases","proportion of pairs","operating room","appropriate sample sizes","detected transmitted isolates","observed counts of transmitted isolates","perioperative surgical site infections","Associated surveillance","total sample size","viruses","probability of infection","binomial test","combinations of specialty","combinations of specialties","effectiveness","clinicians of pathogenic bacteria","intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria","sampling protocol","basic measures","additional measures","Subsequent sampling","detected dose response","absence of serial correlation","Boschloo\u0027s exact test","independent binomial proportions","hub disinfection","hand hygiene","closed lumen intravenous systems","multifaceted approach","observational units","patient decolonization","Abstract Reductions","patients","screening","quality of prevention","Coronavirus Disease","historical cohort data","multiple hospitals","testing","strategies","environmental cleaning","population","samples","purpose","stage","incidence","acceptable threshold","periods","fixed series of tests","COVID","conclusion","rooms","endpoint","day","presence"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution in northern California and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included the need for transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The overall median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; p=0.001). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.7%), hypertension (30.6%) and diabetes mellitus (22.4%).

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lokman, Syed Mohammad; Rasheduzzaman, Md.; Salauddin, Asma; Barua, Rocktim; Tanzina, Afsana Yeasmin; Rumi, Meheadi Hasan; Hossain, Md.

Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ruoran; Rivers, Caitlin; Tan, Qi; Murray, Megan B; Toner, Eric; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2fbf0c7b861542849d5a3db1182b3bdeba9dc44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Guangzhou","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","Chinese cities","major US cities","peak ICU bed","ICU capacities","confirmed COVID","lockdown of Wuhan","ill COVID","effect of COVID","day","adults","timing of disease control measures","strict disease control measures","local healthcare system","local transmission of SARS","planning of local healthcare resources","timing of SARS","local hospitalization","US city","epidemic peak","serious inpatients","serious condition","Sustained spread of SARS","critical care","Guangzhou","average","critical condition","Capacity needs","inpatient bed","community spread","intensive care unit","higher prevalence of vulnerable populations","weeks","relation","outbreaks","Background","number","Results","week of case importation","Methods","month","Conclusion","Plans"],"language":"en"},

However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline.

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore\u2032s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niehus, Rene; De Salazar, Pablo M; Taylor, Aimee; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adb3a6501ad731eda95d0a1a182a793a0dcd58b0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health Security"],"locations":["Singapore","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["relative imported case detection capacity","countries of low detection capacity","Singapore","HPDI","imported cases relative","high sensitivity of case detection","likely case-detection capacities","s capacity","current number of imported cases","Undetected cases","high surveillance locations","assumptions of perfect detection","estimates of case","Wuhan","low surveillance locations","international travelers","contact-tracing capacity","intermediate surveillance locations","high connectivity","strong epidemiological surveillance","global ability","Risk of COVID","fold","greater risk","Global Health Security index","world","times","variation","epidemic evidence","component","Bayesian modeling approach","epicenter","Recent work","infection","simple mathematical model","accounting","outbreak","severity","residents","brief","underestimation of prevalence"],"language":"en"},

We want to confirm the potential mechanisms, including reduced phosphorylation of AKT/MAPK pathways, as well as enhanced CD8\u002B T-cell-mediated antitumor immune response. To clarify the mechanism of propranolol activity in colorectal cancer, the therapeutic activity of propranolol was then assessed in CT26WT tumors engrafted in BALB/C mice. Then the effect of propranolol treatment was also examined by randomizing patients undergoing surgical resection of a previously untreated colorectal cancer to propranolol or placebo group and treated for 1 week prior to surgery. CT26WT tumor size was smaller after propranolol than vehicle control. Propranolol downregulated the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in tumor tissue. The frequency of tumor CD8\u002B T cells was significantly elevated in propranolol-treated mice. The expression of GzmB/IFN-\u03B3/T-bet in the CD8\u002B T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol treated mice tumor tissue. In propranolol-treated surgical specimens, the expression of p-ERK was decreased and the frequency of CD8\u002B was significantly elevated. The expression of GzmB in the CD8\u002B T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol-treated subjects. Together these data show propranolol simultaneously activating autologous CD8\u002B T cells and decreasing the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in mouse tumor models, while inhibiting the expression of p-ERK in clinical colorectal cancer.

While many individual studies have examined the reliability and validity of various self-report measures for assessing SB, it is not clear, in general, how self-reported SB (e.g., questionnaires, logs, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs)) compares to device measures (e.g., accelerometers, inclinometers). OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this systematic review was to compare self-report versus device measures of SB in adults. METHODS Six bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies which included a comparable self-report and device measure of SB in adults. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed. Results were synthesized using meta-analyses. RESULTS The review included 185 unique studies. A total of 123 studies comprising 173 comparisons and data from 55,199 participants were used to examine general criterion validity. The average mean difference was -105.19 minutes/day (95% CI: -127.21, -83.17); self-report underestimated sedentary time by ~1.74 hours/day compared to device measures. Self-reported time spent sedentary at work was ~40 minutes higher than when assessed by devices. Single item measures performed more poorly than multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries. On average, when compared to inclinometers, multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries were not significantly different, but had substantial amount of variability (up to 6 hours/day within individual studies) with approximately half over-reporting and half under-reporting. A total of 54 studies provided an assessment of reliability of a self-report measure, on average the reliability was good (ICC = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS Evidence from this review suggests that single-item self-report measures generally underestimate sedentary time when compared to device measures. For accuracy, multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries with a shorter recall period should be encouraged above single item questions and longer recall periods if sedentary time is a primary outcome of study. Users should also be aware of the high degree of variability between and within tools. Studies should exert caution when comparing associations between different self-report and device measures with health outcomes.

After the Al-doping process, the Ead and S values increase to -40.7 kcal/mol and 83.9, respectively, indicating an excellent agreement with the experimental results. We showed a relation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the S value, confirming with the experimental results. Also, the proposed Al-doped ZnO nanosheet shows a good selectivity to HCHO gas at the presence of H2, NH3, C2H5OH, CO, and CH4 gases. A short recovery time of 18 s is predicted for Al-ZnO-based sensor which is comparable with the experimental value of 26 s.

Cancer treatments are known to create physical and psychosocial challenges, which may be amplified for older adults with cancer. Learning and applying self-management behaviours and skills during treatment with cancer can help to manage/recover health and improve quality of life. In many other chronic illnesses, self-management interventions are known to improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of self-management interventions for older adults with cancer on physical, psychosocial, and health system-related outcomes. METHODS We are conducting a systematic review of self-management interventions for older adults (65\u002B) diagnosed with cancer (solid tumour or haematological) in the active treatment phase of cancer. This systematic review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Studies are limited to experimental or quasi-experimental methods published in English, French, German, or Dutch. A search strategy was designed with a Health Sciences librarian and performed using the following electronic databases: Ageline, AMED, ASSIA, Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, and Sociological Abstracts. Approximately 14,000 titles and abstracts are being electronically screened by a minimum of 2 reviewers, with relevant studies to be screened for full text. The final sample of included studies will be assessed for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Down and Black for quasi-experimental studies, with data synthesized in a narrative and tabular format. DISCUSSION This systematic review will expand the knowledge base of interventions supporting self-management for older adults with cancer. This study will inform future intervention development by identifying gaps and strengths in effective self-management interventions targeting the needs of older adults receiving active treatment for cancer.

It has been widely endorsed by relevant specialty colleges and societies. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Generic guidelines exist for the intubation of different patient groups, as do resources to facilitate airway rescue and transition to the \u0022can\u0027t intubate, can\u0027t oxygenate\u0022 scenario. They should be followed where they do not contradict our specific recommendations for the COVID-19 patient group. Consideration should be given to using a checklist that has been specifically modified for the COVID-19 patient group. Early intubation should be considered to prevent the additional risk to staff of emergency intubation and to avoid prolonged use of high flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. Significant institutional preparation is required to optimise staff and patient safety in preparing for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group. The principles for airway management should be the same for all patients with COVID-19 (asymptomatic, mild or critically unwell). Safe, simple, familiar, reliable and robust practices should be adopted for all episodes of airway management for patients with COVID-19. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT Airway clinicians in Australia and New Zealand should now already be involved in regular intensive training for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group. This training should focus on the principles of early intervention, meticulous planning, vigilant infection control, efficient processes, clear communication and standardised practice.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brewster, David J; Chrimes, Nicholas; Do, Thy Bt; Fraser, Kirstin; Groombridge, Christopher J; Higgs, Andy; Humar, Matthew J; Leeuwenburg, Timothy J; McGloughlin, Steven; Newman, Fiona G; Nickson, Chris P; Rehak, Adam; Vokes, David; Gatward, Jonathan J","journal":"The Medical journal of Australia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["COVID","episodes of airway management","airway rescue","patient safety","STATEMENT Airway clinicians","intubation of different patient groups","Early intubation","staff of emergency intubation","aid staff preparation","Australia","New Zealand","patients","principles of early intervention","specific recommendations","Significant institutional preparation","regular intensive training","MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Generic guidelines","efficient processes","vigilant infection control","meticulous planning","prolonged use of high flow nasal oxygen","clear communication","resources","non-invasive ventilation","coronavirus disease","RESULT","standardised practice","robust practices","clinical guidance","additional risk","pandemic","relevant specialty colleges","societies","transition","CHANGES","INTRODUCTION","scenario","Consideration","checklist"],"language":"en"},

These specimens included repeated urine samples taken in 3 d from 75 volunteers. The urinary concentrations of desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-olefin), and desmethyl-acetamiprid (DM-ACE) were higher (4-40 times) than those of their parent compounds (IMI and acetamiprid, ACE). DN-IMI and IMI-olefin accounted for 92% of the urinary \u03A33IMI (the sum of IMI and its specific metabolites measured). Positive correlations (r) were observed between DN-IMI and IMI (0.50), IMI-olefin and IMI (0.75), and DM-ACE and ACE (0.53). Good to excellent inter-day reliabilities (unadjusted intraclass correlation coefficients) were observed for IMI-olefin (0.61) and DM-ACE (0.81), while moderate inter-day reliability was observed for DN-IMI (0.43).

Smartphone ophthalmoscopy involves using a smartphone camera for digital retinal imaging. Utilizing smartphones to detect DR is potentially more affordable, accessible, and easier to use than conventional methods. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various smartphone ophthalmoscopy approaches for detecting DR in diabetic patients. METHODS We performed an electronic search on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for literature published from January 2000 to November 2018. We included studies involving diabetic patients, which compared the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone ophthalmoscopy for detecting DR to an accurate or commonly employed reference standard, such as indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and tabletop fundus photography. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, with disagreements resolved via consensus. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using the random effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed. This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies guidelines. RESULTS In all, nine studies involving 1430 participants were included. Most studies were of high quality, except one study with limited applicability because of its reference standard. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting any DR was 87% (95% CI 74%-94%) and 94% (81%-98%); mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was 39% (10%-79%) and 95% (91%-98%); moderate NPDR was 71% (57%-81%) and 95% (88%-98%); severe NPDR was 80% (49%-94%) and 97% (88%-99%); proliferative DR (PDR) was 92% (79%-97%) and 99% (96%-99%); diabetic macular edema was 79% (63%-89%) and 93% (82%-97%); and referral-warranted DR was 91% (86%-94%) and 89% (56%-98%). The area under SROC curve ranged from 0.879 to 0.979. The diagnostic odds ratio ranged from 11.3 to 1225.

Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4\u002B T cell count but not the CD8\u002B T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4\u002B T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSIONS A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yulong; Zhang, Zhicheng; Tian, Jie; Xiong, Shaoyun","journal":"Annals of palliative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/apm.2020.03.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Nanchang"],"keyphrases":["patients","disease progression evaluation","aggravated disease","non-aggravation group","invasive lesions","T cell count","acute respiratory disease","aggravation group had1 patient","total lymphocyte count","nonaggravation group","higher cell count of total lymphocytes","normal chest CT","groups","multiple lobes","laboratory characteristics","risk factors","significant differences","nCoV infections","white blood cell","binary logistic regression analysis","CD4","emerging infection","Chest computed tomography","laboratory measurements","cases","Correlation analysis","clinical characteristics","admission","cohort","binary logistic regression model","vital factor","acute respiratory distress syndrome","common symptoms","diarrhea symptoms","septic shock","refractory metabolic acidosis","albumin","CRP","WBC","C-reactive protein","coagulation dysfunction","CD8","LDH","complications","early stage","lungs","lactate dehydrogenase","immune response","better outcome","reported history of contact","intensive care unit","ICU","mechanical ventilation","novel coronavirus","respect","CONCLUSIONS","comparison","extreme health concern","China","death","dyspnea","days","D-dimer","short period","ages","years old","Wuhan","fatigue","BACKGROUND","standardized treatment","METHODS","Hospital of Nanchang","Fever","cough","women","study"],"language":"en"},

To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method.

Because the NPI was developed using data obtained from conscious patients with pain, we evaluated the performance of NPI in comparison with the SPI and the analgesia nociception index (ANI) in patients under general anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The time of nociception occurrence was defined as when the signs of inadequate anaesthesia occurred. The median values of NPI, SPI, and ANI for 1 minute from the time of the sign of inadequate anaesthesia were determined as the value of each analgesic index that represents inadequate anaesthesia. The time of no nociception was determined as 2 minutes before the onset of skin incision, and the median value for 1 minute from that time was defined as the baseline value. In total, 81 patients were included in the analysis. NPI showed good performance in distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia during propofol-remifentanil based general anaesthesia. NPI had the highest value in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, albeit without statistical significance (NPI: 0.733, SPI: 0.722, ANI: 0.668). The coefficient of variations of baseline values of NPI, SPI, and ANI were 27.5, 47.2, and 26.1, respectively. Thus, the NPI was effective for detecting inadequate anaesthesia, showing similar performance with both indices and less baseline inter-individual variability than the SPI.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Chanki; Yang, Min-Ho; Choi, Bohyun; Jeon, Bokyung; Lee, Yong-Hun; Shin, Hangsik; Lee, Boreom; Choi, Byung-Moon; Noh, Gyu-Jeong","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64033-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPI","SPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["performance of NPI","SPI","baseline values of NPI","distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia","median values of NPI","general anaesthesia","sign of inadequate anaesthesia","signs of inadequate anaesthesia","analgesia nociception index","nasal photoplethysmographic index","new analgesic index","time of nociception occurrence","highest value","surgical pleth index","distinguishing pain","propofol-remifentanil","good performance","similar performance","conscious patients","nasal photoplethysmography","baseline inter-individual variability","target-controlled infusion of propofol","indices","terms of area","characteristic curve","statistical significance","onset of skin incision","numerical rating scale","receiver","minutes","data","comparison","coefficient of variations","previous study","total","analysis"],"language":"en"},

One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R","journal":"Annals of the American Thoracic Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202004-327fr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","HAPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung injury","management of HAPE","treatment of COVID","pulmonary vasodilators","altered lung compliance","pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE","high altitude pulmonary edema","acetazolamide","entities","forms of acute altitude illness","considerable attention","high utility","considerable speculation","acute mountain sickness","large number of patients","impaired carbon dioxide transport","worsened ventilation-perfusion matching","systemic hypotension","notion","social media","free open access medicine","risk of multiple adverse consequences","radiographic opacities","increased work of breathing","hypoxemia","clinical features","ARDS","similarities","efforts","causes","idea","equivalent","treatments","concept"],"language":"en"},

The Hemangioma Investigator Group has created consensus recommendations for management of infantile hemangiomas via telemedicine. FDA/EMA approved monitoring guidelines, clinical practice guidelines and relevant, up-to-date publications regarding initiation and monitoring of beta-blocker therapy were used to inform the recommendations. Clinical decision-making guidelines about when telehealth is an appropriate alternative to in-office visits, including medication initiation, dosage changes, and ongoing evaluation are included.

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dost, Burhan; Koksal, Ersin; Terzi, \u00D6zlem; Bilgin, Sezgin; Ustun, Yasemin Burcu; Arslan, Hatice Nilden","journal":"Surgical infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2020.097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reanimation Society","IBM"],"locations":["China","Turkey"],"keyphrases":["residents","knowledge of anesthesiology specialists","incidence of COVID","descriptive study","healthcare providers","survey data","patients","Turkey","patient-healthcare provider safety","survey form","aforementioned survey","intensive care units","correct attitudes","website SurveyMonkey","application methods","patient death","research assistants","Reanimation Society","airway management","social media platforms Twitter","settings","little professional experience","emergency operations","LinkedIn","San Mateo","practical training","various health institutions","Turkish Anaesthesiology","participants","provision of theoretical","NY","panic","total","tendency","IBM","Armonk","members","WhatsApp","disease","strategies","cases","Background","novel coronavirus","distress","incorrect decisions","SPSS","majority","algorithms","Results","Wuhan","Conclusions","pandemic","awareness","issue","e-mail addresses","China"],"language":"en"},

A novel active dry ECG electrode, which based on the conductive flexible and stretchable Ag NWs/PDMS composite material is designed to acquire the electrocardiographic potentials through the cloth. Meanwhile, a membrane pressure sensor is applied to obtain the respiratory signal, which can avoid the intervention in the sleep process. Combining the novel active ECG electrode and the membrane pressure sensor, the followed signal acquisition circuit is designed to monitor the ECG and respiratory signals simultaneously without fixing any external sensor to the human body. To verify the performance of the proposed system, a comprehensive test protocol is presented. Firstly, we characterized the electrical properties and the signal sensing capability of the proposed sensor. Furthermore, the performance of the entire system is assessed to verify the effects caused by different clothing materials and sleep postures to the ECG signal and the respiratory signal acquisition. The average Pearson correlation coefficient of the RR interval that extracted from the ECG signal obtained by the proposed system and the commercial PSG device can reach over 0.9 of different clothes and postures. As for the respiration acquisition, the accuracy of the respiration rate in different postures can reach 95% during the 2 hours monitoring process. The experimental results are promising, which demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve favorable signal quality and satisfy the basic requirements of the cardiorespiratory monitoring during sleep.

The objective of this study was to identify specific serum miRNAs as potential biomarkers for screening lung adenocarcinoma. The study was divided into a screening phase, training phase, and validation phase. The expression of 46 serum miRNAs from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and healthy controls (HCs) were examined in the screening phase. The expression of the most dysregulated miRNAs was further verified in training (30 LUAD vs. 30 HCs) and validation (82 LUAD vs. 90 HCs) phases. Seven serum miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-203a-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-486-5p and miR-146a-5p) in LUAD patients were significantly dysregulated compared to those in HCs. Their ability to diagnose lung cancer was also significant, with miR-142-5p (AUC = 0.743), miR-409-3p (AUC = 0.755), miR-223-3p (AUC = 0.828) and miR-146a-5p (AUC = 0.745) being more prominent. The combined use of these four could enhance diagnostic value (AUC = 0.933). Our findings define a distinct miRNA expression profile in the serum of LUAD patients.

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.

Patients\u0027 outcomes in terms of incidence of resolution and time to leakage resolution were compared by leakage characteristics and type of treatment. Three patients were lost to follow up. RESULTS Leakage occurred in a median of 6 days from surgery, and for majority of patients (80.3%), it was in the upper part of the sleeve. The median dimension of leakage was 6.5 mm. Low level leakage resulted in a lower time of resolution (p \u003C 0.001). Patients with clinical leakage were treated with surgery or endoscopic placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS). The median time of leakage resolution was 42 days. The hospitalization time for SEMS was shorter with a 68.3% of complete resolution compared with the 29.4% of surgery. In patients with subclinical and small leakage, a conservative treatment was successful in 87.5%. Overall 39.4% of patients needed a second line treatment after that the first failed.

All patients had hand-sewn anastomoses and protective ileostomies. There were no conversions, abdominal perineal resections or postoperative deaths. Four patients had a complication, including three presacral abscesses, all managed by transanastomotic drainage. At 3 months after ileostomy closure, all patients had perfect continence. Apart from a greater tumour diameter in patients with low rectal cancers (6\u00B70 cm versus 4\u00B76 cm in those with mid rectal tumours; P = 0\u00B7035), clinical features were similar in the two groups. CRM positivity was greater for low than for mid rectal tumours (3 of 13 versus 0 of 25 respectively; P = 0\u00B7034), and more patients with a low tumour had TME grade 2 (4 of 13 versus 1 of 25; P = 0\u00B7038). There was no difference in oncological outcomes at 17 months. CONCLUSION Although this study cohort was small, special attention should be paid to bulky low rectal tumours to reduce the rate of CRM positivity.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thien, H H; Hiep, P N; Thanh, P H; Xuan, N T; Trung, T N; Vy, P T; Dong, P X; Hieu, M T; Son, N H","journal":"BJS open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI","TME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rectal resection","low rectal cancers","mid rectal tumours","bulky low rectal tumours","low tumour","METHODS Patients","advanced mid-low rectal cancer","advanced rectal cancer","Postoperative results","elective resection","rate of CRM positivity","TaTME technique","months","circumferential resection margin","greater tumour diameter","study cohort","postoperative deaths","clinical features","functional outcomes","oncological outcomes","results of transanal total mesorectal excision","clinical complete response","assessment","perforation","multiple malignancies","intestinal obstruction","morbidity","laparoscopy","special attention","short-term survival","distant metastasis","abdominal perineal resections","hand-sewn anastomoses","T3 category","ileostomy closure","protective ileostomies","conversions","presacral abscesses","perfect continence","TME grade","chemoradiotherapy","CONCLUSION","difference","complication","transanastomotic drainage","years","groups","BACKGROUND","women","anal verge","duration of surgery","BMI","m2"],"language":"en"},

A new surgical treatment involves high-pressure inflation of a balloon within the ET, with the aim of dilating the soft tissue structure. However, the mechanical effects of this intervention have not been established, nor the impact of changing device size or other technical parameters. A novel experimental technique allowed quantification of plastic and elastic tissue deformation in model materials and then human cadaver ETs during balloon dilation, based on the measured balloon inflation pressure-volume relationship. Plastic tissue deformation was found to be greater using larger balloons and deeper device insertion, but increasing the inflation pressure had a more limited effect, with most deformation occurring well below the clinically used pressures. Histological assessment of ET tissue suggested that mucosal tearing and cartilage cracking were in part responsible for the mechanical changes. Balloon dilation of the ET has huge potential if found to be clinically effective, but currently there is a need to understand and develop the technique further. The novel methods employed in this study will be valuable in future laboratory and in vivo studies of ET balloon dilation. Pressures are reported in Bar as this unit is used for medical balloon dilation procedures in clinical practice. 1 Bar = 100,000 Pa. Graphical abstract caption Dilation of the Eustachian tube for obstructive dysfunction is performed clinically with 3- and 6-mm-diameter balloons of approximately the same overall length. Our data suggest that dilation with a 6-mm balloon causes greater deformation of the soft tissue structure than dilation with a 3-mm balloon. This difference has yet to be demonstrated clinically. Plastic deformation was measured in terms of energy (J) dissipated during balloon inflation.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Matthew E; Weir, Anna E; Prior, Daisy C C; Cope, Wei; Tysome, James R; Sutcliffe, Michael","journal":"Medical \u0026 biological engineering \u0026 computing","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-020-02121-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ET"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies of ET balloon dilation","medical balloon dilation procedures","Plastic tissue deformation","Plastic deformation","elastic tissue deformation","greater deformation","measured balloon inflation pressure-volume relationship","soft tissue structure","Histological assessment of ET tissue","Graphical abstract caption Dilation","high-pressure inflation","Obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction","quantification of plastic","obstructive dysfunction","Bar","pressures","novel experimental technique","larger balloons","diameter balloons","novel methods","mechanical effects","mechanical changes","deeper device insertion","impact of changing device size","model materials","human cadaver ETs","OETD","future laboratory","inadequate opening","mucosal tearing","study","clinical practice","common condition","cartilage cracking","new surgical treatment","technical parameters","terms of energy","limited effect","huge potential","unit","aim","overall length","intervention","need","data","difference"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with better functional outcome after stroke. Whether obesity influences the benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) in stroke patients is unknown. We evaluated the association between body mass index (BMI) and outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel -occlusion (LVO), and assessed whether BMI affects the -benefit of EVT. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands trial (-ISRCTN10888758). BMI was used as a continuous and categorical variable, distinguishing underweight and normal weight (BMI \u003C25), overweight (BMI 25-30), and obesity (BMI \u226530). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to estimate the association of BMI with functional outcome (shift analysis), assessed with modified Rankin Scale (mRs) at 90 days. The impact of BMI on EVT effect was tested by the use of a multiplicative interaction term. RESULTS Of 366 patients, 160 (44%) were underweight or normal weight, 145 (40%) overweight, and 61 (17%) were obese. In multivariable analysis with BMI as a continuous variable, we found a shift toward better functional outcome with higher BMI (mRS adjusted common OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.0-1.09), and mortality was inversely related to BMI (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Safety analysis showed that higher BMI was associated with lower risk of stroke progression (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.99). Additional analysis showed no interaction between BMI and EVT effect on functional outcome, mortality, and other safety outcomes. CONCLUSION Our study confirms the effect of obesity on outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO, meaning better functional outcome, lower mortality, and lower risk of stroke progression for patients with higher BMI. As we found no interaction between BMI and EVT effect, all BMI classes may expect the same benefit from EVT.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pirson, France Anne Victoire; Hinsenveld, Wouter H; Staals, Julie; de Greef, Bianca T A; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik W J; Vos, Jan Albert; Schonewille, Wouter J; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J","journal":"Cerebrovascular diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000504744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI","EVT"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["higher BMI","association of BMI","impact of BMI","BMI classes","stroke outcome","better functional outcome","EVT effect","effect of obesity","acute ischemic stroke patients","benefit of EVT","lower risk of stroke progression","shift analysis","multivariable analysis","Safety analysis","impact of obesity","Additional analysis","lower mortality","benefit of endovascular treatment","multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis","continuous variable","LVO","mRs","aOR","normal weight","overweight","well-known risk factor","multiplicative interaction term","Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment","Netherlands trial","categorical variable","safety outcomes","large vessel -occlusion","vascular disease","use","body mass index","modified Rankin Scale","post","BACKGROUND","study","days","ISRCTN10888758","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","studies"],"language":"en"},

Results We found a total of 9,760 publications related to coronaviruses published from 2000 to 2020. The Journal of Virology has been the most popular journal in this field over the past 20 years. The United States maintained a top position worldwide and has provided a pivotal influence, followed by China. Among all the institutions, the University of Hong Kong was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. Moreover, Professors Yuen KY and Peiris JSM made great achievements in coronavirus research. We analysed the keywords and identified 5 coronavirus research hotspot clusters. Conclusions We considered the publication information regarding different countries, institutions, authors, journals, etc. by summarizing the literature on coronaviruses over the past 20 years. We analysed the studies on COVID-19 and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. Notably, COVID-19 must become the research hotspot of coronavirus research, and clinical research on COVID-19 may be the key to defeating this epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Zhengbo; Zhou, Siming; Yao, Renqi; Wen, Kaicheng; Da, Wacili; Meng, Yan; Yang, Keda; Liu, Hang; Tao, Lin","journal":"Annals of translational medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.04.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Peiris JSM"],"organizations":["SARS","Professors Yuen KY"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["research hotspot of coronavirus research","research trends","clinical research","research hotspots","research collaboration","coronavirus research hotspot clusters","MERS coronaviruses","Background COVID","publication information","MERS information","institutions","keywords","SARS","China","publication trends","years","bibliometric analysis","popular journal","Journal of Virology","relevant publications","online analysis platform of literature metrology","bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder","Peiris JSM","BICOMB","great achievements","different countries","Professors Yuen KY","new prevention strategies","CiteSpace software","unpredictable harm","authors","journals","leader","field","University of Hong Kong","position","humans","Methods","pivotal influence","Web of Science database","United States","Conclusions","total","epidemic","VOSviewer","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

Conservation management programmes for the chimpanzee have been established outside their natural range (ex situ), and chimpanzees from these programmes could potentially be used to supplement future conservation initiatives in the wild (in situ). However, these programmes have often suffered from inadequate information about the geographical origin and subspecies ancestry of the founders. Here, we present a newly designed capture array with ~60,000 ancestry informative markers used to infer ancestry of individual chimpanzees in ex situ populations and determine geographical origin of confiscated sanctuary individuals. From a test panel of 167 chimpanzees with unknown origins or subspecies labels, we identify 90 suitable non-admixed individuals in the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Ex situ Programme (EEP). Equally important, another 46 individuals have been identified with admixed subspecies ancestries, which therefore over time, should be naturally phased out of the breeding populations. With potential for future re-introduction to the wild, we determine the geographical origin of 31 individuals that were confiscated from the illegal trade and demonstrate the promises of using non-invasive sampling in future conservation action plans. Collectively, our genomic approach provides an exemplar for ex situ management of endangered species and offers an efficient tool in future in situ efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frandsen, Peter; Fontsere, Claudia; Nielsen, Svend Vendelbo; Hangh\u00F8j, Kristian; Castejon-Fernandez, Natalia; Lizano, Esther; Hughes, David; Hernandez-Rodriguez, Jessica; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand; Carlsen, Frands; Siegismund, Hans Redlef; Mailund, Thomas; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Hvilsom, Christina","journal":"Heredity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-020-0313-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Association of Zoos and Aquaria"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ex situ populations","Ex situ Programme","situ efforts","subspecies ancestry","illegal trade","ex situ management of endangered species","future conservation initiatives","Conservation management programmes","geographical origin of confiscated sanctuary individuals","ancestry of individual chimpanzees","illegal wildlife trade","future conservation action plans","subspecies labels","suitable non-admixed individuals","illegal pet","future re-introduction","admixed subspecies ancestries","bushmeat trade","breeding populations","ancestry informative markers","natural habitat","natural range","common chimpanzee","EAZA","Aquaria","European Association of Zoos","non-invasive sampling","efficient tool","exemplar","consequence of damaging anthropogenic impact","unknown origins","Pan troglodytes","promises","inadequate information","impending risk","designed capture array","EEP","test panel","genomic approach","potential","founders","time"],"language":"en"},

The rise of digital technologies may influence the delivery of compassionate care, and thus this relationship between compassion and digital health care needs to be better understood. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aimed to identify existing digital technologies being used by patients and health professionals in the delivery of mental health care, understand how digital technologies are being used in the delivery of compassionate mental health care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to digital technology use among patients and health professionals in the delivery of compassionate mental health care. METHODS We conducted this scoping review through a search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), MEDLINE In-Process and EPub Ahead of Print, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published from 1990 to 2019. RESULTS Of the 4472 articles screened, 37 articles were included for data extraction. Telemedicine was the most widely used technology by mental health professionals. Digital technologies were described as facilitating compassionate care and were classified using a conceptual model to identify each digital intersection with compassionate care. Facilitators of and barriers to providing compassionate care through digital technology were identified, including increased safety for providers, health care professional perceptions and abilities, and the use of picture-in-picture feedback to evaluate social cues. CONCLUSIONS Implementing digital technology into mental health care can improve the current delivery of compassionate care and create novel ways to provide compassion. However, as this is a new area of study, mental health professionals and organizations alike should be mindful that compassionate human-centered care is maintained in the delivery of digital health care. Future research could develop tools to facilitate and evaluate the enactment of compassion within digital health care.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kemp, Jessica; Zhang, Timothy; Inglis, Fiona; Wiljer, David; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Crawford, Allison; Lo, Brian; Charow, Rebecca; Munnery, Mikayla; Singh Takhar, Shuranjeet; Strudwick, Gillian","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/16263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cumulative Index","Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis","Retrieval System Online","Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delivery of digital health care","delivery of mental health care","delivery of compassionate mental health care","mental health professionals","health care professional perceptions","current delivery of compassionate care","compassionate human-centered care","Allied Health Literature","digital intersection","digital technology use","existing digital technologies","rise of digital technologies","achievement of positive health outcomes","articles","enactment of compassion","BACKGROUND Compassion","patients","use of picture","MEDLINE","scoping review","barriers","facilitators","picture feedback","Medical Literature Analysis","Nursing","search of Cumulative Index","Retrieval System","providers","abilities","increased safety","organizations","vital component","relationship","new area of study","novel ways","PsycINFO","Print","EPub","Process","CONCLUSIONS","Web of Science","conceptual model","tools","social cues","Future research","data extraction","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","RESULTS","Telemedicine"],"language":"en"},

DOTA-JR11 is a SST2 targeting ligand with a five times higher tumor uptake than DOTATATE, and holds promise to improve plaque imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of DOTA-JR11 for plaque detection. METHODS AND RESULTS Atherosclerotic ApoE-/- mice (n = 22) fed an atherogenic diet were imaged by SPECT/CT two hours post injection of [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 (~ 200 pmol, ~ 50 MBq). In vivo plaque uptake of [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 was visible in all mice, with a target-to-background-ratio (TBR) of 2.23 \u00B1 0.35. Post-mortem scans after thymectomy and ex vivo scans of the arteries after excision of the arteries confirmed plaque uptake of the radioligand with TBRs of 2.46 \u00B1 0.52 and 3.43 \u00B1 1.45 respectively. Oil red O lipid-staining and ex vivo autoradiography of excised arteries showed [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 uptake at plaque locations. Histological processing showed CD68 (macrophages) and SST2 expressing cells in plaques.

CONCLUSIONS These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheng, Xiaoyan; Liu, Fenyu; Zhou, Jin; Liao, Rongrong","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDS"],"locations":["Guangzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["sleep quality score","sleep quality of nursing interns","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","collective isolation","correlation analysis","psychological status","surveyed interns","Descriptive analysis","Univariate analysis","self-rating anxiety scale","self-rating depression scale","current status","single factor analysis","SAS","SDS","PSQI score","self-designed questionnaire","high levels of anxiety","potential factors","major factors","interns\u0027 psychology","adequate interventions","persons","recent contact","Guangzhou","basic information form","affected area","national norms","outbreak of coronavirus disease","mental health","China","COVID","general teaching hospital","onset of fever","evidence","CONCLUSIONS","total","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide seriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because of lung dysfunction. Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China and Japan. Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative stress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood. The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue. The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03B2, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, I\u03BAB and NF\u03BAB and increased p-Akt. Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice. Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jian, Tunyu; Chen, Jian; Ding, Xiaoqin; Lv, Han; Li, Jiawei; Wu, Yuexian; Ren, Bingru; Tong, Bei; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Su, Kelei; Li, Weilin","journal":"Food \u0026 function","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c9fo02921d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TF"],"locations":["Asia","China","Japan"],"keyphrases":["TF treatment","treatment of CS","action of TF","lungs of CS","CS-induced COPD airway inflammation","treatment of lung disease","lungs of COPD mice","oxidative stress","progressive lung disease","lung tissues","CS-induced mouse model","lung dysfunction","Loquat leaves","downregulated TRPV1","regulation of TRPV1","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","protective activity","expression of SOD","chronic respiratory conditions","new functional material","increased p-Akt","p-JNK level","TNF-\u03B1","inhibition of inflammation","underlying mechanism","functional applications","putative mechanism","morphological changes","histological changes","protective effect","inducible nitric oxide synthase","important material","level of malondialdehyde","activity of superoxide dismutase","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid","NF\u03BAB","iNOS","reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines","cytochrome P450 2E1","related signal pathway","main active components","interleukin","I\u03BAB","CYP2E1","remarkable anti-inflammatory","Asia","severe illness","phosphorylation of IKK","patients","mortality","successful treatments","antioxidant activities","present study","China","concern","MDA","addition","Total flavonoids","Japan","findings","cigarette smoking","results","novel coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

We report the first epidemiological, socio-demographic, and clinical findings for the first 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ecuador. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 COVID-19 confirmed cases in Ecuador from 27 February to 18 April 2020. The overall incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate was computed according to the entire population at risk living in a canton or a province. Disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates as well as relative risk and odds ratios were computed as an outcome. Results: Since the first case reported in Ecuador on 27 Feb 2020, at least 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases of which 474 deaths were officially registered over a 54-day period. Men accounted for 55.40% (n = 5, 247) of the overall cases with an incidence rate of 60.5 per 100,000 while women accounted for 44.60 % (n = 4, 221) representing 47.2 per 100,000. The mortality rate per canton showed that cantons with a lower attack rate had higher mortality rates. Coastal cantons have a lower attack rate than the highlands and living above \u003E2,500 m seems to be linked with a lower risk of dying (RR: 0.63 [CI 95% 0.50 - 0.79]). Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%). Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind in Ecuador. The results of this analysis show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, which increases as with age and the presence of comorbidities. Areas with better testing capabilities reported lower CFR% and mortality, additionally cantons located above 2,500 m have lower attack and mortality rates although the risk of dying is greater among highlanders.

Pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases and blocks ciliogenesis. Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10- and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yanatori, Izumi; Dhekne, Herschel S.; Vides, Edmundo G.; Sobu, Yuriko; Diez, Federico; Pfeffer, Suzanne R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79ff43715f7626d980f00f7cb1dc96bbdef1184f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.065664","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pathogenic","Myosin Va.","Myosin Va","RPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes","LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10","Myosin Va-dependent manner","RILPL2 relocalizes","expression of RILPL2","LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A","depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels","presence of pathogenic LRRK2","globular tail domain of Myosin Va","certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms","molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis","blocks ciliogenesis","LRRK2 kinase cause Parkinson\u2019s disease","Rab effector","absence of phosphoRab10","subset of Rab GTPases","novel phospho-Rab","binding partner","peri-centriolar region","high affinity binding site","motor protein","partners","understanding","mutations","condition","strong preference","mother centriole","RPE cells","normal roles","experiments"],"language":"en"},

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P\u003C0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens.

Norway closed all kindergartens, schools and universities, and banned sports and cultural activities, while Sweden kept most institutions and trainings facilities open. We aimed to compare peoples\u0027 attitudes towards authorities and control measures, and effects on life in Norway and Sweden. Design: Anonymous web-based surveys for individuals age 15 or older distributed through Facebook using the snowball method. Setting: Norway and Sweden, mid-March to mid-April, 2020. Participants: Altogether, 3,508 individuals participated in the survey; 3000 in Norway and 508 in Sweden. 79% of the participants were women, 60% of the Norwegians and 47% of the Swedes were between 30-49 years, and around 45% of the participants in both countries had more than 4 years of higher education. Outcome measures: Perceived threat of the pandemic, views on infection control measures, and impact on daily life. We performed descriptive analyses of the responses and compared the two countries. Results: People had high trust in the health services in both countries, but differed in the degree of trust in their government (17% had high trust in Norway and 37% in Sweden). More Norwegians than Swedes agreed that school closure was a good measure (66% Norway and 18% in Sweden), and that countries with open schools were irresponsible (65% in Norway and 23% in Sweden). About the same amount responded that COVID-19 was a large to very large threat to the population (53% in Norway and 58% in Sweden), whereas more Norwegians than Swedes responded that the threat from repercussions of the mitigation measures were large or very large (71% in Norway and 56% in Sweden). Compliance with infection preventive measures was high and similar in the two countries (more than 98%). In Norway, 69% lived a more sedentary life during the pandemic versus 50% in Sweden; and Norwegians reported they ate more than Swedes (44% in Norway and 33% in Sweden). Conclusion: Sweden, with less restrictive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, had a higher level of trust in the authorities, while Norwegians reported a more negative lifestyle during the pandemic. The level of trust in the health care system and self-reported compliance with preventive measures was high in both countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Helsingen, L.

We developed strategies to generate articular cartilage from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a source of clinically relevant tissues for joint repair1. Previously, we demonstrated that these chondrocytes retain cartilage forming potential following subcutaneous implantation in mice. In this report, we evaluated the potential of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived articular cartilage tissue to repair osteochondral defects created in the rat knee. Following implantation, the hESCderived cartilage maintained a proteoglycan and type II collagen-rich matrix, and was well integrated with native rat tissue at the basal and lateral surfaces. The ability to generate cartilage tissue with integrative and reparative properties from an unlimited and robust cell source represents a significant clinical advance for cartilage repair that can be applied to large animal models and ultimately to patient care.","publish_time":"2018-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, Oliver F.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed. We aimed to develop and validate a score for early prediction of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we included 1138 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients admitted to 33 hospitals in Guangdong Province from December 27, 2019 to March 4, 2020 (N =818; training cohort), as well as two hospitals in Hubei Province from January 21 to February 22, 2020 (N =320; validation cohort) in the analysis. Results: The 14-day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration were 7.9% and 12.1% in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. An Early WArning Score (EWAS) (ranging from 0 to 4.5), comprising of age, underlying chronic disease, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, was developed (AUROC: 0.857). By applying the EWAS, patients were categorized into low-, medium-, and high risk groups (cut-off values: two and three). The 14-day cumulative incidence of clinical deterioration in the low-risk group was 1.8%, which was significantly lower than the incidence rates in the medium- (14.4%) and high-risk (40.9%) groups (P \u003C.001). The predictability of EWAS was similar in the validation cohort (AUROC =0.781), patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups had 14-day cumulative incidences of 2.6%, 10.0%, and 25.7%, respectively (P \u003C.001). Conclusion: The EWAS, which is based on five common parameters, can predict COVID-19-related clinical deterioration and may be a useful tool for a rapid triage and establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that will greatly focus clinical management and medical resources to reduce mortality in highly endemic areas.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yabing; Liu, Yingxia; Lu, Jiatao; Fan, Rong; Zhang, Fuchun; Yin, Xueru; Liu, Zhihong; Zeng, Qinglang; Yuan, Jing; Hu, Shufang; Wang, Qiongya; Liao, Baolin; Huang, Mingxing; Yin, Sichun; Zhang, Xilin; Xin, Rui; Lin, Zhanzhou; Hu, Changzheng; Zhao, Boliang; He, Ridong; Liang, Minfeng; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Li; Sun, Jian; Tang, Lu; Deng, Lisi; Xia, Jinyu; Tang, Xiaoping; Liu, Lei; Hou, Jinlin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b88a0ee9d3f7a9c0d0b5afb4028baa9ce403d76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20064691v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["clinical management","patients","early prediction of clinical deterioration of COVID","day cumulative incidence of clinical deterioration","day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration","related clinical deterioration","moderate COVID","training cohort","high-risk groups","predictability of EWAS","high risk groups","hierarchical management system","low-risk group","endemic areas","efficient management","AUROC","validation cohorts","hospitals","retrospective multicenter cohort study","Early WArning Score","chronic disease","incidence rates","Guangdong Province","Hubei Province","health system capacity","pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease","lymphocyte ratio","C-reactive protein","neutrophil","mortality","D-dimer levels","useful tool","medical resources","rapid triage","cut-off values","Methods","Background","Approaches","common parameters","Results","analysis","Conclusion"],"language":"en"}]}

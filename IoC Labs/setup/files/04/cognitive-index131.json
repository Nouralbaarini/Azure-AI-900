Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF). The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR = 1.76, IC95 = [1.01\u20133.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR = 2.31, IC95 = [1.20\u20134.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR = 2.57, IC95 = [1.31\u20135.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR = 1.85, IC95 = [0.98\u20133.59]) were additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: COVID19 pandemic has a negative impact on young French urologists in training and on their work and training quality. Managing their psychosocial well-being during this time is as important as managing their physical health.

Therefore, it has been perplexing and enigmatic to witness the growing homeless population sleeping outside in public areas in recent years. Public actions have been called for to deal with the problem. However, the approach of these public actions has depended on how the problem of homelessness has been defined. This paper presents a historical context of how homelessness has been presented in policy discourses. Further, on the basis of a survey conducted in 2004, this paper describes the profile of the homeless and discusses why the homeless began sleeping on the streets. Finally, an outreach worker narrates his story about working with the homeless in Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan. The paper also includes policy implications in terms of appropriate public actions to be taken in response to the homelessness problem in Taiwan.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Li-Chen; Yang, Yun-Sheng","journal":"City, Culture and Society","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/689f50da2fa9142c7961ebc673123af9379f66ae.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3afb14bd1fed732c0d10fdf937e65a503bcc18fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877916610000366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877916610000366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan","Taipei City"],"keyphrases":["public policy","public areas","paper","problem of homelessness","homelessness problem","terms of appropriate public actions","policy implications","growing homeless population","capital of Taiwan","policy discourses","response","Taipei City","high percentage of home ownership","story","recent years","historical context","citizens","outreach worker","survey","profile","approach","Abstract","basis","streets"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. METHODS: We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States. DISCUSSION: These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel. Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.

The cDNA probes detected enteroviruses with a variable level of sensitivity which presumably depended on the degree of genomic homology with the detecting probes. Generally probes from coxsackievirus A21 detected more enteroviruses than did similar probes from coxsackievirus B4.

This gap also has resulted in variation of the educational curriculum in the academic setting and a lack of consistent preparation for emergency responses. The purpose of this study was to develop a list of competencies and measurable activities, or terminal objectives, for hospital-based health care personnel applicable for use during routine patient care activities as well as during natural and man-made disasters. Methods Competencies and terminal objectives related to infection prevention and control were developed using an evidence-based approach comprising the following steps: (a) review of the literature, (b) review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, (c) synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, (d) expert panel review and competency refinement using the Delphi survey process, and (e) delineation of competencies by occupation. The 8 disciplines addressed were nurses (RNs and LPNs), nursing assistants, physicians, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, environmental services, laboratory professionals, and ancillary staff. Results An initial list of competency statements and terminal objectives were compiled and then vetted by a Delphi panel of experts in infection prevention and control until\u003E80% agreement was achieved on all competency statements and terminal objectives. Conclusion The final matrix of competencies and terminal objectives developed through this process may be used as a content framework for educational curricula and training materials for hospital-based health care personnel. The process also may be of use in determining the core competencies and terminal objectives regarding infection prevention and control for health care personnel in other settings. Validation of these results is an important next step.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrico, Ruth M.; Rebmann, Terri; English, Judith F.; Mackey, JoEllen; Cronin, Sherill Nones","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a125265919886034e8bec3a56c600656de445cb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132736.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655308006974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19084164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2008.05.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655308006974","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Delphi"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["terminal objectives","training objectives","list of competencies","core competencies","delineation of competencies","Methods Competencies","review of existing competencies","hospital-based health care personnel applicable","synthesis of new competencies","final matrix of competencies","Background Infection prevention","lack of identified practice competencies","control education","routine patient care activities","competency refinement","use","educational curricula","expert panel review","evidence-based approach","initial list of competency statements","Delphi survey process","results","Delphi panel of experts","training materials","respiratory therapists","occupational therapists","published curricula","measurable activities","educational curriculum","lack of consistent preparation","laboratory professionals","environmental services","nursing assistants","physicians","organizations","academic setting","RNs","LPNs","content framework","following steps","emergency responses","ancillary staff","nurses","variation","Conclusion","literature","agreement","settings","man-made disasters","disciplines","Validation","study","purpose","gap"],"language":"en"},

An effective strategy to block transmission of pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza in HCWs is important. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An infection control program was implemented to survey and prevent nosocomial outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) influenza at a 2,600-bed, tertiary-care academic hospital. In total, 4,963 employees at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital recorded their temperature and received online education on control practices for influenza infections. Administration records provided vaccination records and occupational characteristics of all HCWs. Early recognition of a pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza case was followed by a semi-structured questionnaire to analyze possible routes of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact. Surveillance spanned August 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010; 51 HCWs were confirmed to have novel H1N1 (2009) influenza by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of patient contact, household contact, or unspecified contact infection was 13.7% (7/51), 13.7% (7/51), and 72.5% (37/51), respectively. The prevalence of the novel H1N1 infection was significantly lower among vaccinated HCWs than among unvaccinated HCWs (p\u003C0.001). Higher viral loads in throat swabs were found in HCWs with patient and household contact infection than in those with unspecified contact infection (4.15 vs. 3.53 copies/mL, log(10), p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A surveillance system with daily temperature recordings and online education for HCWs is important for a low attack rate of H1N1 (2009) influenza transmission before H1N1 (2009) influenza vaccination is available, and the attack rate is further decreased after mass vaccination. Unspecified contact infection rates were significantly higher than that of patient contact and household contact infection, highlighting the need for public education of influenza transmission in addition to hospital infection control.","publish_time":"2012-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Tsui-Ping; Li, Chung-Chen; Wang, Lin; Hsu, Li-Wen; Eng, Hock-Liew; You, Huey-Ling; Liu, Jien-Wei; Wei, Chi-Chen; Chang, Ling-Sai; Lee, Ing-Kit; Yang, Kuender D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9d32ac6db6f898b035aab6d4357342c3ae2442b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3302803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22427871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["household contact infection","Unspecified contact infection rates","Prevalence of patient contact","novel H1N1 infection","influenza vaccination","hospital infection control","influenza case","influenza infections","unvaccinated HCWs","transmission of pandemic H1N1","possible routes of patient contact","public education of influenza transmission","infection control program","low attack rate of H1N1","nosocomial outbreaks of H1N1","online education","vaccination records","Memorial Hospital","control practices","academic hospital","mass vaccination","transmission of emerging infectious diseases","Administration records","surveillance system","daily temperature recordings","Higher viral loads","patients","quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","addition","need","Kaohsiung Chang","healthcare workers","throat swabs","semi-structured questionnaire","occupational characteristics","employees","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","bed","effective strategy","total","CONCLUSION","tertiary","METHODOLOGY","Early recognition","copies","BACKGROUND","Concerns","timely manner"],"language":"en"},

We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T \u2265 37.5 \u00B0C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1\u2013June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7\u20138 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wen-Zeng; Zhang, Song-Jian; Wang, Quan-Yi; Li, Yin-Dong; Jing, Hong-Bo; Hu, Guang-Yi; Wu, Dan","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/357d43fba827a0d33c5810a56e193149df4777f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6805422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640591/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4473-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["probable cases","hospitalization cases","Confirmed cases","additional cases","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","interviewing students","symptomatic students","teachers","primary school","school developed fever","diagnosis of pneumonia","school absenteeism records","macrolide resistance","Oropharyngeal swabs","China","duplex qPCR assay","staffs","control practice","cough","Pathogen detection results","years","control measures","weeks","outbreak of acute respiratory disease","future infectious disease prevention","future outbreaks","macrolide-resistant","causative agent","etiologic agent","long-term hospitalization","serious complications","drug resistance surveillance system","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","Shunyi CDC","P1 type","order","Beijing","sore throat","radiograph findings consistent","inpatients","infections","genotype","sequencing","epidemics","point mutation","gene level","mutated strains","similar symptoms","attack rate","position","age range","investigation","CONCLUSIONS","median","METHODS","attention","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS: Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category \u2018other poultry\u2019. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogerwerf, Lenny; Roof, Inge; de Jong, Marianne J.

The aim of this confirmatory, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 study was to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of IC43 recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine in non-surgical ICU patients. METHODS: Eight hundred patients aged 18 to 80 years admitted to the ICU with expected need for mechanical ventilation for \u2265 48 h were randomized 1:1 to either IC43 100 \u03BCg or saline placebo, given in two vaccinations 7 days apart. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality in patients 28 days after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity and safety were also evaluated. FINDINGS: All-cause mortality rates at day 28 were 29.2% vs 27.7% in the IC43 and placebo groups, respectively (P = .67). Overall survival (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, P = .46) and proportion of patients with \u2265 one confirmed P. aeruginosa invasive infection or respiratory tract infection also did not differ significantly between both groups. The geometric mean fold increase in OprF/I titers was 1.5 after the first vaccination, 20 at day 28, after the second vaccination, and 2.9 at day 180. Significantly more patients in the placebo group (96.5%) had \u2265 one adverse event (AE) versus the IC43 100 \u03BCg group (93.1%) (P = .04). The most frequently reported severe AEs in the IC43 and placebo groups were respiratory failure (6.9% vs 5.7%, respectively), septic shock (4.1% vs 6.5%), cardiac arrest (4.3% vs 5.7%), multiorgan failure (4.6% vs 5.5%), and sepsis (4.6% vs 4.2%). No related serious AEs were reported in the IC43 group. INTERPRETATION: The IC43 100 \u03BCg vaccine was well tolerated in this large population of medically ill, mechanically ventilated patients.

Among cases of TIBOLA, a case of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) is diagnosed when an eschar is present on the scalp, accompanied by peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP). Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5 \u00D7 1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent. CONCLUSION: With an isolated case of SENLAT and a confirmation of B. henselae in Korea, it is pertinent to raise awareness to physicians in other Asian countries that B. henselae could be a causative agent for SENLAT.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Jun-Won; Kim, Choon-Mee; Yun, Na Ra; Kim, Dong-Min; Kim, Sung Soon; Choi, Sangho; Chu, Hyuk","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3af738266bd0662e912f230a89f7d9e49d2b8a5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7066777.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7066777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of scalp eschar","right scalp area","enlarged lymph nodes","Bartonella henselae","cases of SENLAT","right neck area","isolated case of SENLAT","neck lymphadenopathy","tick bite","CASE PRESENTATION","Tick-borne lymphadenopathy","peripheral lymphadenopathy","cases of TIBOLA","causative agent","hunting","high fever","onset of symptoms","deer home","water deer","Bartonella internal transcribed spacer","spotted fever group rickettsiae","species","cervical palpation","results of nested PCR","medical advice","days","confirmation of","lesion","Fine needle aspiration","year-old male","awareness","physicians","Asian countries","lump","infectious disease","Korea","Physical examination","BACKGROUND","diarrhea","LAP","CONCLUSION","weeks","visit"],"language":"en"},

Aim: To perform the molecular characterization of the G and F proteins of Brazilian wild-type BRSV strains derived from bovine respiratory infections in both beef and dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Ten BRSV strains derived from a dairy heifer rearing unit (n = 3) in 2011 and steers of three other feedlots (n = 7) in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. For the BRSV G and F partial gene amplifications, RT-nested-PCR assays were performed with sequencing in both directions with forward and reverse primers used. Results: The G gene-based analysis revealed that two strains were highly similar to the BRSV sequences representative of subgroup III, including the Bayovac vaccine strain. However, the remaining seven Brazilian BRSV strains were diverse when compared with strains representative of the BRSV I to VIII subgroups. The central hydrophobic region of the Brazilian BRSV G gene showed the replacement of conserved cysteines and other residues of importance to antibody reactivity. The deduced F gene amino acid sequences from the Brazilian BRSV strains showed changes that were absent in the representative sequences of the known subgroups. Viral isolation on the nasopharyngeal swab suspensions failed to isolate BRSV. Conclusion: Results suggest that these strains represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV with mutations observed in the immunodominant region of the G protein. However, further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leme, Raquel Arruda; Dall Agnol, Alais Maria; Balbo, Luciana Carvalho; Pereira, Fernanda Louise; Possatti, Fl\u00E1via; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo","journal":"Vet Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f8b4be3920af4adbfcad1d03f96c10ff2adc674.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7067174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV G","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Brazilian BRSV strains","Brazilian BRSV G gene","strains representative","BRSV sequences representative of subgroup","F proteins of Brazilian wild-type BRSV strains","putative new subgroup of BRSV","G protein","representative sequences","G gene-based analysis","bovine respiratory infections","bovine respiratory disease","Bovine orthopneumovirus","F partial gene amplifications","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","deduced F gene amino acid sequences","Results","known subgroups","immunodominant region","dairy heifer","dairy cattle","central hydrophobic region","RT-nested","mutations","replacement of conserved cysteines","residues of importance","nasopharyngeal swab suspensions","beef","PCR assays","Viral isolation","changes","molecular characterization","directions","sequencing","antibody reactivity","unit","BRD","Materials","Methods","studies","Bayovac vaccine strain","reverse primers","steers","feedlots","Background","Conclusion","pathogenic potential"],"language":"en"},

A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources\u2014Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive\u2014to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tizzoni, Michele; Panisson, Andr\u00E9; Paolotti, Daniela; Cattuto, Ciro","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcc24ada1a2703f1e0c3f243113f3a4f2f2ce164.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7067377.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GDELT Project"],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["epidemic outbreaks","Zika virus epidemic","public awareness","disease dynamics","patterns of Zika","epidemiological data","scarcity of data","empirical data","related Wikipedia pageviews","geo-referenced data","theoretical epidemic models","media exposure","Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal","terms of Zika","disease transmission dynamics","interaction","news coverage","triggered media coverage","media pressure","studies","attention","population-scale information","human behaviour change","public health agencies","important role of collective awareness","news volume","related pages","general modelling framework","number of modelling efforts","international alert","online sources","relation","nonlinear dependencies","memory effects","GDELT Project","Internet Archive","activity profile","beginning","assumption","United States","national television broadcast","behavioural signal","recent years","magnitude","extent"],"language":"en"},

The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture. Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations. To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation. Additional modifications of further attenuated rVSV vectors to upregulate expression of HIV-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation.","publish_time":"2006-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clarke, David K.; Cooper, David; Egan, Michael A.; Hendry, R.

Twenty-one patients (17%) tested positive for a respiratory virus. The per-1,000 positivity rates were influenza virus 66, RSV 49, rhinovirus 33, metapneumovirus 16, and coronavirus 8. No link was found between virologic results and clinical outcome. A strong link was found between the rate of influenza virus positivity and the incidence of flu-like illness in the community (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: These results show that respiratory virus infection\u2014particularly influenza virus infection during epidemic periods\u2014is common among patients hospitalized for acute cardiorespiratory failure.","publish_time":"2005-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrat, Fabrice; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Tonnellier, Marc; Baudel, Jean-Luc; Deshayes, Juliette; Meyer, Pascal; Maury, Eric; Galimand, Julie; Rouzioux, Christine; Offenstadt, Georges","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28628fdc7be8f278578c9f4d55e365b79eb8a6f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079937.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","influenza virus infection","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory failure","detection of influenza virus","rate of influenza virus positivity","prevalence of respiratory virus infections","acute cardiorespiratory failure","cardiac failure","critical care unit","new simplified acute physiology score","RSV","metapneumovirus","virologic results","illness","rhinovirus","admission","coronavirus","positivity rates","strong link","SAPS","pulmonary disorders","polymerase chain reaction","PCR","epidemic periods","study","female","incidence of flu","place","consecutive winters","nasal swab","community","clinical outcome","years","SETTING","mean age","DESIGN","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

This is particularly the case for humanized monoclonal antibodies which are the largest and fastest growing class of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. This demand has fostered efforts to improve the efficiency of production as well as to address the quality of the final product. Chinese hamster ovary cells are the predominant hosts for stable transfection and high efficiency production on a large scale. Specific productivity of recombinant glycoproteins from these cells can be expected to be above 50 pg/cell/day giving rise to culture systems with titers of around 5 g/L if appropriate fed-batch systems are employed. Cell engineering can delay the onset of programmed cell death to ensure prolonged maintenance of productive viable cells. The clinical efficacy and quality of the final product can be improved by strategic metabolic engineering. The best example of this is the targeted production of afucosylated antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, an important function for use in cancer therapies. The development of culture media from non-animal sources continues and is important to ensure products of consistent quality and without the potential danger of contamination. Process efficiencies may also be improved by employing disposable bioreactors with the associated minimization of downtime.

The advisory process is, in the ideal situation, a collective duty of science and politics. The final decision rests ultimately with politicians. An understanding of the differences between science and politics is necessary for successfully providing advice to politicians. The requirements necessary to allow politics to substantially follow the advice of scientists are multifarious. The first of these is trust from the side of politics and the public and from the side of science competitive research, respect and communication skills, neutrality and integrity. From these requireberatung ments it is possible to derive criteria for quality assurance in advice to politics. The maintenance of scientific expertise at the competitive international level demands independent, qualified and adequately financed research. Governmental institutes have an antenna function: they have to recognize in good time whether risks are increasing, whether the government has to be informed and whether there is a need for action. The continuing maintenance of excellence requires measures of quality assurance at all levels. Evidence for the quality of advice to politics can, for example, be found in the good reputation of an institution and its prominent representatives. Success in research is an indirect quality criterion that can be and should be measured to a certain extent. The influence of advisory activities on political decisions is direct evidence for the quality of the advice.

Nearly all current drugs suffer from one or more limitations, which emphasizes the critical need to develop new approaches and new molecules. We reasoned that a \u2018poly-pharmacy\u2019 approach relying on simultaneous binding to multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells could pave the way to a more effective therapeutic outcome. This work presents the study of a synthetic, small molecule displaying pleiotropicity of interactions as a competitive antagonist of viral or cell surface receptors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate-binding proteins, which play important roles in HCMV entry and spread. Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG), a functional mimetic of heparan sulfate, inhibits HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts and neuroepithelioma cells with high potency. At the same time, SPGG exhibits no toxicity at levels as high as 50-fold more than its inhibition potency. Interestingly, cell-ELISA assays showed downregulation in HCMV immediate-early gene 1 and 2 (IE 1\u00262) expression in presence of SPGG further supporting inhibition of viral entry. Finally, HCMV foci were observed to decrease significantly in the presence of SPGG suggesting impact on viral spread too. Overall, this work offers the first evidence that pleiotropicity, such as demonstrated by SPGG, may offer a new poly-therapeutic approach toward effective inhibition of HCMV.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elste, James; Kaltenbach, Dominik; Patel, Vraj R.; Nguyen, Max T.; Sharthiya, Harsh; Tandon, Ritesh; Mehta, Satish K.; Volin, Michael V.; Fornaro, Michele; Tiwari, Vaibhav; Desai, Umesh R.","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9409d069e5f32bcafe5afa6f0fa478bab41029a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sulfated"],"organizations":["HCMV","SPGG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV entry","effective inhibition of HCMV","HCMV foci","presence of SPGG","inhibition of viral entry","viral spread","HCMV immediate-early gene","inhibition potency","heparan sulfate proteoglycans","heparan sulfate-binding proteins","new poly-therapeutic approach","functional mimetic of heparan sulfate","new approaches","new molecules","high potency","work","cell surface receptors","competitive antagonist of viral","effective therapeutic outcome","multiple receptors","simultaneous binding","neuroepithelioma cells","pleiotropicity of interactions","host cells","Human cytomegalovirus","poly-pharmacy","human foreskin fibroblasts","cell-ELISA assays","life-threatening illnesses","newborns","downregulation","severe developmental disabilities","individuals","manifestations","small molecule","way","important roles","critical need","compromised immune system","general population","study","toxicity","levels","infections","fold","impact","limitations","Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside","evidence","time","expression","current drugs"],"language":"en"},

Although several genetic factors have been related to HIV-1 resistance, the homozygosity for a mutation in CCR5 gene (the 32-bp deletion, i.e., CCR5-Delta32 allele) is presently considered the most relevant one. The C-type lectins, DC-SIGN (present on dendritic cells and macrophages) and DC-SIGNR (present on endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes) efficiently bind and transmit HIV-1 to susceptible cell in trans, thereby augmenting the infection. A potential association of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR neck domain repeat polymorphism and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. To determine the influence of host genetic factors on HIV-1 resistance, we conducted genetic risk association study in HIV-1-exposed seronegative (n = 47) individuals, HIV-1 seronegative (n = 262) healthy control, and HIV-1-infected seropositive patients (n = 168) for polymorphism in neck domain of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes. The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction method in DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed by sequencing. Fisher exact or \u03C7 (2) test was used for static analysis. DC-SIGN genotype and allele distribution was fairly similar in HIV-1-exposed seronegative, HIV-1 seropositive, and HIV-1 seronegative control.

However, many of its proposed functions may be specific to strain, subtype, host, or cell line. In this review, we start by describing the well-defined global host-shutoff ability of PA-X and the potential mechanisms underlying it. We move on to the role played by PA-X in modulating innate and acquired immune responses in the host. We then systematically discuss the role played by PA-X in modulating the virulence of influenza viruses of different subtypes and host origins, and finish with a general overview of the research advances made in identifying the host cell partners that interact with PA-X. To uncover possible clues about the differential effects of PA-X in modulating viral virulence, we focus on systemically evaluating polymorphisms in PA-X from various viral subtypes and hosts, including avian and human H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 viruses.

The arrangement of these ORFs on the PLPV genome closely resembles that of members of the genus Carmovirus in the family Tombusviridae and, moreover, most of the putative PLPV gene products showed high identity with proteins of this viral group. However, several striking differences were noticed. Carmoviruses generate two subgenomic RNAs whereas PLPV produces a single one. In addition, only p7 showed similarity with movement proteins of carmoviruses whereas p6 (as p13) has no viral (or other) homologs. This protein might be expressed from a non-canonical start codon or, alternatively, through a \u22121 frameshift (FS) mechanism. Both, the production of one subgenomic RNA and the likely involvement of a \u22121 FS for expression of an internal ORF parallel the translation strategies reported for the unique species of the genus Panicovirus, belonging also to the family Tombusviridae.

The structural glycoproteins, specifically the E protein, are known to interact with the host\u2019s carbohydrate receptors through the viral proteins\u2019 N-glycosylation sites and thus mediate the viral invasion of cells. This review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus\u2019 exploitation of the host\u2019s glycans, especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties. We also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions, focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate-binding agents derived from plants, commonly known as lectins, to inhibit the progression of infection.","publish_time":"2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Idris, Fakhriedzwan; Muharram, Siti Hanna; Diah, Suwarni","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzgwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dengue virus","dengue infection","involvement of dengue glycoproteins","dengue hemorrhagic fever","dengue shock syndrome","host\u2019s carbohydrate receptors","RNA virus","structural glycoproteins","interactions","host\u2019s glycans","use of carbohydrate","carbohydrate moieties","course of infection","progression of infection","functional glycoproteins","host\u2019s cellular enzymes","antiviral therapies","host receptors","nonstructural proteins","E protein","viral invasion of cells","specific antiviral treatments available","viral proteins\u2019 N-glycosylation sites","major public health problem","licensed vaccine","tropical regions","enveloped viruses","plants","binding agents","genus Flavivirus","prM","exploitation","recent developments","processes","infections","lectins","individuals","NS1","review"],"language":"en"},

Such fluctuations suggest that zinc(II) ions are signalling ions used for the regulation of proteins. One function is the inhibition of enzymes. It is quite common that enzymes bind zinc(II) ions with micro- or nanomolar affinities in their active sites that contain catalytic dyads or triads with a combination of glutamate (aspartate), histidine and cysteine residues, which are all typical zinc-binding ligands. However, for such binding to be physiologically significant, the binding constants must be compatible with the cellular availability of zinc(II) ions. The affinity of inhibitory zinc(II) ions for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03B2 is particularly high (K (i) = 21 pM, pH 7.4), indicating that some enzymes bind zinc almost as strongly as zinc metalloenzymes. The competitive pattern of zinc inhibition for this phosphatase implicates its active site cysteine and nearby residues in the coordination of zinc. Quantitative biophysical data on both affinities of proteins for zinc and cellular zinc(II) ion concentrations provide the basis for examining the physiological significance of inhibitory zinc-binding sites in proteins and the role of zinc(II) ions in cellular signalling. Regulatory functions of zinc(II) ions add a significant level of complexity to biological control of metabolism and signal transduction and embody a new paradigm for the role of transition metal ions in cell biology.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maret, Wolfgang","journal":"Biometals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2a626c3979ffbb1d00fcab7b256f000986a4b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087665.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular zinc","role of zinc","coordination of zinc","zinc metalloenzymes","cellular availability of zinc","affinity of inhibitory zinc","Regulatory functions of zinc","concentrations of cellular free zinc","typical zinc-binding ligands","competitive pattern of zinc inhibition","physiological significance of inhibitory zinc-binding sites","role of transition metal ions","cellular signalling","affinities of proteins","binding constants","inhibition of enzymes","active sites","cysteine residues","regulation of proteins","active site cysteine","nearby residues","nanomolar affinities","ion concentrations","significant level of complexity","receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03B2","biological control of metabolism","signal transduction","new paradigm","triads","aspartate","catalytic dyads","combination of glutamate","cell biology","basis","histidine","Quantitative biophysical data","pathways","fluctuations"],"language":"en"},

Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 291 of 779 (37.4%) animals. The prevalence rates of rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli K99\u002B were lower as seen in 242 of 806 (30.0%), 46/806 (5.7%), and 16/421 (3.8%) of animals, respectively. Of the 224 Cryptosporidium-positive specimens available for molecular analysis, Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 213 (95.1%) specimens, Cryptosporidium bovis in eight (3.6%), and Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in three (1.3%). Sequence analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene identified 16 IIa subtypes and a new subtype family, with 120 of the 216 (55.6%) positive specimens having the subtype IIaA18G3R1. Eight of the IIa subtypes were previously seen in humans in Northern Ireland. Several subtypes were temporally or geographically unique. The genetic diversity in calves in Northern Ireland was much greater than that reported from other areas. This work demonstrates the utility of genotyping and subtyping tools in characterizing the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves and humans.","publish_time":"2006-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Heather P.; Dooley, James S.

In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs. We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Cheng-I.; Postema, Pieter G.; Arbelo, Elena; Behr, Elijah R.; Bezzina, Connie R.; Napolitano, Carlo; Robyns, Tomas; Probst, Vincent; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Remme, Carol Ann; Wilde, Arthur A.M.","journal":"Heart Rhythm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb54cc309adbd640bff2254582bc095b5e0ff2fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156157.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S154752712030285X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32244059/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154752712030285X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes","virus","Management of patients","potential COVID","inherited defect","pandemic","Brugada syndrome","associated lung disease COVID","Short QT syndrome","Long QT syndrome","Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID","pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID","associated risks","disease outcome","Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia","therapeutic considerations","setting","recommendations","increased risk","electrolyte disturbances","fever","stress","conditions","cardiac arrhythmias","co-morbidities","related issues","local possibilities","high transmission rate","consequent","monitoring","SARS-COV","antiviral drugs","threat","proven effective therapy","impact","importance","diseases","public health","case","world"],"language":"en"},

Methods We selected a panel of 14 expert endoscopists. We identified 41 common indications for advanced endoscopic procedures from the ASGE Appropriate Use of GI Endoscopy guidelines. Using a modified Delphi method, we first achieved consensus on patient-important outcome for each procedural indication. Panelists prioritized consensus patient-important outcome when categorizing each indication into one of the following 3 procedural time periods: (1) time-sensitive emergent (schedule within 1 week), (2) time-sensitive urgent (schedule within 1 to 8 weeks), and (3) non-time sensitive (defer for \u003E8 weeks and then reassess the timing). Three anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. Results All 14 invited experts agreed to participate in the study. The prespecified consensus threshold of 51% was achieved for assigning patient-important outcome/s to each advanced endoscopy indication. The prespecified consensus threshold of 66.7% was achieved for 40 out of 41 advanced endoscopy indications in stratifying them into 1 of 3 procedural time periods. For 12 out of 41 indications 100% consensus, and for 20 out of 41 indications 75% to 99% consensus was achieved. Conclusions By using a Modified Delphi method that prioritized patient-important outcomes, we developed consensus recommendations on procedural timing for common indications for advanced endoscopy. These recommendations and the structured decision framework provided by our study can inform decision-making as endoscopy services are reopened.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawhney, Mandeep S.; Bilal, Mohammad; Pohl, Heiko; Kushnir, Vladimir; Khashab, Mouen A.; Schulman, Allison R.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Chalal, Prabhleen; Muthusamy, V.

We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1\u20133 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of \u226550 breaths per min; fever of \u226539\u00B0C; C-reactive protein concentration of \u2265476\u00B720 nmol/L [\u226550 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297. FINDINGS: Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3\u00B74 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7\u00B77 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63\u00B73% (95% CI 56\u00B70\u201369\u00B73; p\u003C0\u00B70001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p\u003C0\u00B70001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0\u00B730), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment. INTERPRETATION: Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations. Further research is needed to disentangle the inflammatory versus antimicrobial aspects of this relation.

The current financial information systems serve to provide latest information. However, they lack sophisticated analytical tools. This paper proposes a new architecture for financial information systems. The developed prototype is entitled as the Multi-level and Interactive Stock Market Investment System (MISMIS). It is specially designed for investors to build their financial models to forecast stock price and index. The performance of the financial models can be evaluated on a virtual trading platform. There are other features in MISMIS that are tailor-made to handle financial data; these include synchronized time frame, time series prediction techniques, preprocessing and transformation functions, multi-level modeling and interactive user interface. To illustrate the capability of MISMIS, we have evaluated strategies of trading the future options of Hang Seng Index (HSI). We find that historical HSI, Dow Jones Index, property price index, retailing sales figure, prime lending rate, and consumer price index in Hong Kong are essential factors affecting the performance of the trading of HSI\u2019s future option. Also there are some feedbacks from the in-depth interviews of six financial consultant upon how they perceived the prototype MISMIS.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Vincent","journal":"Knowledge-Based Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a105b9c43649f54434beb3224ccef73174fe7fef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127451.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705110000687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705110000687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2010.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Interactive Stock Market Investment System","HSI","Hang Seng","Dow Jones"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["financial models","financial data","financial consultant","property price index","consumer price index","stock price","current financial information systems","prototype MISMIS","capability of MISMIS","Dow Jones Index","Interactive Stock Market Investment System","future options of Hang Seng Index","performance","latest information","virtual trading platform","trading of HSI\u2019s future option","multi-level modeling","popular investment platform","historical HSI","individual investors","developed prototype","synchronized time frame","interactive user interface","time series prediction techniques","transformation functions","prime lending rate","sales figure","Hong Kong","essential factors","new architecture","in-depth interviews","paper","strategies","sophisticated analytical tools","feedbacks","features"],"language":"en"},

The Ministry of Health decided to introduce Influenza to the list of diseases with epidemic potential. By April 2010, Togo was actively involved in influenza surveillance. This study aims to describe the implementation of ILI surveillance and results obtained from April 2010 to December 2012. METHODS: Two sites were selected based on their accessibility and affordability to patients, their adequate specimen storage capacity and transportation system. Patients with ILI presenting at sentinel sites were enrolled by trained medical staff based on the World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples were collected and they were tested at the National Influenza Reference Laboratory using a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) validated real time RT-PCR protocol. Laboratory results and epidemiological data were reported weekly and shared with all sentinel sites, Ministry of Health, Division of Epidemiology, WHO and CDC/NAMRU-3. RESULTS: From April 2010 to December 2012, a total of 955 samples were collected with 52% of the study population aged between 0 and 4 years. Of the 955 samples, 236 (24.7%) tested positive for influenza viruses; with 136 (14.2%) positive for influenza A and 100 (10.5%) positive for influenza B. The highest influenza positive percentage (30%) was observed in 5\u201314 years old and patients aged 0\u20134 and \u003E60 years had the lowest percentage (20%). Clinical symptoms such as cough and rhinorrhea were associated more with ILI patients who were positive for influenza type A than influenza type B. Influenza viruses circulated throughout the year with the positivity rate peaking around the months of January, May and again in October; corresponding respectively to the dry-dusty harmattan season and the long and then the short raining season. The pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09 was the predominantly circulating strain in 2010 while influenza B was the predominantly circulating strain in 2011. The seasonal A/H3N2 was observed throughout 2012 year.

In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer-like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated the potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of central process, including inflammatory response, response to endogenous stimulus and antigen processing and presentation. The use of bioinformatics may help to uncover and analyze large quantities of data identified by microarray analyses, through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of more comprehensive data regarding CTEPH.

Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic. We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes. Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.) with a vaccine containing 10 \u00B5g of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated. We evaluated the induction of RBD-specific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-\u03B3 spot-forming cells and splenocyte cytokine production). Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination. Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited. Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes. The vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses.","publish_time":"2014-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Jiaming; Deng, Yao; Chen, Hong; Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Wen; Guo, Xiaojuan; Lu, Zhuozhuang; Gao, George F.; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9e24b269c1f1772454a1e93cc72c85251aeda6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4236105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25405618/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112602","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG ODN","IFA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV subunit vaccine","subunit vaccination","development of RBD","novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine","\u00B5g of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD","specific humoral immunity","protein of MERS","induction of RBD","cellular immunity","CpG ODN","CoV spike","combination of alum","effective vaccine","robust RBD-specific antibody","murine immunity","c mice","immune responses of mice","cell-mediated immunity","cellular immune responses","Different vaccination regimens","IFA","different adjuvant formulations","adjuvant combinations","T-cell responses","delivery routes","incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant","low level of neutralizing antibodies","rRBD protein","prevention","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","IFN-\u03B3 spot","total IgG","ELISpot assay","cells","guanine","BALB","good candidate antigen","cysteine-phosphate","aluminium hydroxide","receptor-binding domain","polyriboinosinic acid","splenocyte cytokine production","oligodeoxynucleotides","times","data","immunogenicity","pandemic","modification","purified proteins","studies","study","findings","protection"],"language":"en"},

We have developed a RT-PCR assay consisting of a single degenerate primer set, able to detect all members of the Paramyxoviridae family including all virus genera within the subfamilies Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Primers anneal to domain III of the polymerase gene, with the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer annealing to the conserved motif GDNQ, which is proposed to be the active site for nucleotide polymerization. The assay was fully optimized and was shown to indeed detect all available paramyxoviruses tested. Clinical specimens from hospitalized patients that tested positive for known paramyxoviruses in conventional assays were also detected with the novel family-wide test. A high-throughput fluorescence-based RT-PCR version of the assay was developed for screening large numbers of specimens. A large number of samples collected from wild birds was tested, resulting in the detection of avian paramyxoviruses type 1 in both barnacle and white-fronted geese, and type 8 in barnacle geese. Avian metapneumovirus type C was found for the first time in Europe in mallards, greylag geese and common gulls.

In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (\u003C0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B) T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiyotani, Kazuma; Toyoshima, Yujiro; Nemoto, Kensaku; Nakamura, Yusuke","journal":"J Hum Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07a5a23ea7a9a11dbdec9048de63b99e280b5853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200206.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s10038-020-0771-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available epitopes","predicted T cell epitopes","high-affinity epitopes","available vaccine epitopes","HLA class","HLA-class","SARS-CoV","possible peptide epitopes","monitoring T-cell responses","immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus","monitor T-cell","B-cell responses","comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes","host immune responses","high affinity","Japanese population","allele frequencies of HLA molecules","nucleocapsid proteins","nonstructural proteins","valuable information","useful information","immune system","sequences","little information","high homologies","population coverages","current study","current COVID","development of novel vaccines","envelope","membrane","pandemic","HLAs","larger populations","spike","coronaviruses","emergent issue","open reading frames","tools","CD4","regions","deleterious virus","findings","rank","addition","CD8"],"language":"en"},

During this pandemic, the urgent surgical requirements will not stop. As an example, the most recent Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reports estimate that there are 2.8 million trauma patients hospitalized in the United States. These data illustrate an increase in the likelihood of encountering urgent surgical patients with either clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the near future. Preparation for a pandemic involves considering the different levels in the hierarchy of controls and the different phases of the pandemic. Apart from the fact that this pandemic certainly involves many important health, economic, and community ramifications, it also requires several initiatives to mandate what measures are most appropriate to prepare for mitigating the occupational risks. This article provides evidence-based recommendations and measures for the appropriate personal protective equipment for different clinical and surgical activities in various settings. To reduce the occupational risk in treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 urgent orthopaedic patients, recommended precautions and preventive actions (triage area, ED consultation room, induction room, operating room, and recovery room) are reviewed.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Awad, Mohamed E.; Rumley, Jacob C.L.; Vazquez, Jose A.; Devine, John G.","journal":"J Am Acad Orthop Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c83e1bf70af6c484e3952fc9fa4abe9b22709b15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282441/; https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-00227","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["pandemic","confirmed COVID","urgent surgical patients","induction room","operating room","recovery room","confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease","urgent orthopaedic patients","urgent surgical requirements","ED consultation room","different levels","different phases","surgical activities","measures","trauma patients","United States","occupational risks","appropriate personal protective equipment","recent Centers of Disease Control","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","preventive actions","triage area","recommended precautions","evidence-based recommendations","hierarchy of controls","likelihood","Prevention reports","important health","various settings","community ramifications","article","increase","near future","data","example","countries","world","initiatives","Preparation","fact"],"language":"en"},

However, the antiviral effect and mechanisms of IFITMs in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized. In this work, we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular IFITM3 protein. In cell models of DENV\u20102 infection, we found that IFITM3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon\u2010induced inhibition of DENV entry. Most importantly, our study for the first time demonstrated the presence of IFITM\u2010containing exosome in the extracellular environment, and identified an ability of cellular exosome to intercellularly deliver IFITM3 and thus transmit its antiviral effect from infected to non\u2010infected cells. Thus, our findings provide new insights in the basic mechanisms underlying the actions of IFITM3, which might lead to future development of exosome\u2010mediated anti\u2010viral strategies using IFITM3 as a therapeutic agent. Conceivably, variations in the basal and inducible levels of IFITMs, as well as in intracellular and extracellular levels of IFITMs, might predict the severity of dengue virus infections among individuals or across species.","publish_time":"2014-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Xun; He, Zhenjian; Yuan, Jie; Wen, Weitao; Huang, Xuan; Hu, Yiwen; Lin, Cuiji; Pan, Jing; Li, Ran; Deng, Haijing; Liao, Shaowei; Zhou, Rui; Wu, Jueheng; Li, Jun; Li, Mengfeng","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25131332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["actions of IFITM3","extracellular IFITM3 protein","intercellularly deliver IFITM3","extracellular levels of IFITMs","mechanisms of IFITMs","viral infections","inducible levels of IFITMs","ability of cellular exosome","Interferon","extracellular environment","function","anti\u2010viral strategies","future development of exosome","potent antiviral effectors","cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression","basic mechanisms","induced inhibition of DENV entry","non\u2010infected cells","inducible transmembrane proteins","cell models of DENV","severity of dengue virus infections","broad range of enveloped viruses","individuals","response","new insights","IFITM1","baseline","presence of IFITM","therapeutic agent","time","findings","species","variations","investigation","IFITM2","study","work"],"language":"en"},

Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

Laboratory-based surveillance and use of cell phone surveillance may be a useful method. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We established a new model for gathering data directly from district laboratories to regional laboratories and from them to national manager of public health laboratories by using cell phone. We assessed the coverage of Mobile and Cell phone in the laboratory Technicians, and Directors of Public Health in 27 universities in Iran by a simple data collection form to evaluate the feasibility of this method. And then this method was piloted for the last Cholera out break in Iran in 2005. RESULT: From data of 27 universities with 184 cities, we gathered 769 data health directors\u2019 mobile , total mobile penetrating rate, SMS users, and SMS penetrating rate was 57.9%, 77.1%, and 44.6% between Directors in Medical Universities of Iran and 54.5%, 54.9% and 29.9% in Directors of Laboratory. In the Cholera epidemic in Iran in summer 2005, CDC of MOH registered near 900 cases of cholera from 70000 rectal soap\u2019s exam in whole of country. The median reporting interval was under one day. CONCLUSION: Although the advent of the cell phone will probably change the way in which surveillance is delivered by health system, further studies are warranted to evaluate this method for laboratory based surveillance of lethal infections.","publish_time":"2006-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safaie, Afshin; Mousavi, Seyed Mohsen; LaPorte, Ronald E.; Goya, Mohammad Mehdi; Zahraie, Mohsen","journal":"Eur J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5fd3ec29c6713894bd4181cf86c9237e26a5882.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health","CDC","MOH"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["cell phone surveillance","Laboratory-based surveillance","Directors of Laboratory","data health directors\u2019 mobile","Surveillance systems","Directors of Public Health","Medical Universities of Iran","useful method","health system","laboratory Technicians","surveillance of lethal infections","national manager of public health laboratories","total mobile penetrating rate","SMS penetrating rate","coverage of Mobile","district laboratories","regional laboratories","cases of cholera","Cholera epidemic","simple data collection form","SMS users","communicable diseases","passive","GOAL","summer","rectal soap\u2019s exam","CDC of MOH","feasibility","cities","new model","median reporting interval","day","country","countries","BACKGROUND","advent","studies","way","RESULT","CONCLUSION","MATERIAL"],"language":"en"},

However, there has been less research in the area of dissemination. Proper dissemination of surveillance data can facilitate the end user\u0027s taking of appropriate actions, thus maximizing the utility of effort taken from upstream of the surveillance-to-action loop. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to develop a generic framework for a digital dashboard incorporating features of efficient dashboard design and to demonstrate this framework by specific application to influenza surveillance in Hong Kong. METHODS: Based on the merits of the national websites and principles of efficient dashboard design, we designed an automated influenza surveillance digital dashboard as a demonstration of efficient dissemination of surveillance data. We developed the system to synthesize and display multiple sources of influenza surveillance data streams in the dashboard. Different algorithms can be implemented in the dashboard for incorporating all surveillance data streams to describe the overall influenza activity. RESULTS: We designed and implemented an influenza surveillance dashboard that utilized self-explanatory figures to display multiple surveillance data streams in panels. Indicators for individual data streams as well as for overall influenza activity were summarized in the main page, which can be read at a glance. Data retrieval function was also incorporated to allow data sharing in standard format. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance dashboard serves as a template to illustrate the efficient synthesization and dissemination of multiple-source surveillance data, which may also be applied to other diseases. Surveillance data from multiple sources can be disseminated efficiently using a dashboard design that facilitates the translation of surveillance information to public health actions.","publish_time":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Calvin KY; Ip, Dennis KM; Cowling, Benjamin J; Ho, Lai Ming; Leung, Gabriel M; Lau, Eric HY","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3222192.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22001082/; https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.1658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["influenza surveillance dashboard","source surveillance data","multiple surveillance data streams","Proper dissemination of surveillance data","multiple sources of influenza surveillance data streams","demonstration of efficient dissemination of surveillance data","automated influenza surveillance digital dashboard","collected data","data sharing","different sources of disease surveillance data","individual data streams","translation of surveillance information","Data retrieval function","principles of efficient dashboard design","features of efficient dashboard design","dissemination of multiple","overall influenza activity","efficient synthesization","area of dissemination","generic framework","appropriate actions","Different algorithms","robust statistical methods","public health actions","self-explanatory figures","national websites","specific application","end user\u0027s","template","Hong Kong","study","merits","panels","standard format","Indicators","CONCLUSIONS","utility of effort","main page","BACKGROUND","Great strides","OBJECTIVE","aims","research","action loop","system","diseases","RESULTS","glance"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanisms of establishment of persistent infection are still unclear. In this study, we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from apoptosis in cells infected with SARS-CoV. In persistently infected cells at 50h.p.i., PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 were phosphorylated and the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased. When surviving cells were treated with the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, at 50h.p.i., all cells died, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistently infected cells. Among the signaling pathways in persistently infected cells, Akt and JNK were phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-nucleocapsid (N) protein-expressing Vero E6 cells using vaccinia viral vector (DIs), strongly suggesting that N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK are necessary to establish persistence. These results indicated that at least four proteins, Akt, JNK, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are necessary for survival of persistently SARS-CoV-infected cells.","publish_time":"2006-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Ishii, Koji; Sasaki, Yuko; Kenri, Tsuyoshi; Saijo, Masayuki; Kanaji, Yumi; Shirota, Kinji; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5443c4dfd7df5da39274fc46d1583e5000b76e4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092879.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X06013878; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06013878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JNK","PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","establishment of cells","persistent SARS-CoV infection","Vero E6 cells","Bcl-xL","pathways","JNK-specific inhibitor","protein levels of Bcl","persistent infection","N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt","early stages of SARS","PI3K","persistence","important roles","mechanisms of establishment","vaccinia viral vector","treatment","inhibitors","apoptotic events","DIs","escape","apoptosis","maintenance","p38 MAPK","proteins","survival","nucleocapsid","SP600125","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Red blood cell invasion requires a co-ordinated series of protein/protein interactions, protease cleavage events, intracellular signals, organelle release and engagement of an actin-myosin motor, which provide many potential targets for drug development. As these steps occur in the bloodstream, they are directly susceptible and exposed to drugs. A number of invasion inhibitors against a diverse range of parasite proteins involved in these different processes of invasion have been identified, with several showing potential to be optimised for improved drug-like properties. In this review, we discuss red blood cell invasion as a drug target and highlight a number of approaches for developing antimalarials with invasion inhibitory activity to use in future combination therapies.","publish_time":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burns, Amy L; Dans, Madeline G; Balbin, Juan M; de Koning-Ward, Tania F; Gilson, Paul R; Beeson, James G; Boyle, Michelle J; Wilson, Danny W","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ff291580760e93781c11fad9b343080261f7982.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6524681.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuz005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["Red blood cell invasion","number of invasion inhibitors","invasion inhibitory activity","different processes of invasion","drug target","drug development","improved drug","potential targets","artemisinin combination therapies","future combination therapies","protein interactions","Plasmodium merozoites","parasite survival","new antimalarials","attractive target","number of approaches","novel targets","showing potential","therapeutic development","co-ordinated series of protein","spread of parasites resistant","diverse range of parasite proteins","protease cleavage events","intracellular signals","engagement","organelle release","Southeast Asia","malaria disease","growing need","proliferation","actin-myosin motor","significant global-health burden","review","bloodstream","properties","steps","drugs"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in selected cytokine or chemokines response in asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatic children during acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods Seventy-five children, 6\u201312years of age, admitted with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Two patient groups were defined: the children with known asthma (N =40) and non-asthmatic children (N =35). Interleukin (IL)-18 and selected chemokines, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by means of ELISA in the plasma samples of the patients collected on admission. We investigated the values of these mediators in relation to the asthma status and symptom severity of the patients. Twenty age-matched, non-infected controls were also studied. Results Plasma levels of IL-18 and the chemokines increased significantly in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia compared to non-infected, age-matched controls (P \u003C0.01). However, the asthmatic patients showed significantly reduced IL-18 and CXCL10 responses (P \u003C0.01, \u003C0.05, respectively) and had more severe pneumonia symptoms (P \u003C0.01) compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group (P \u003C0.05). Conclusions Our study suggests that IL-18 and the chemokines are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. It also indicates that some asthmatic children have deficient IL-18 response when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with more severe pneumonia observed in this group of patients.","publish_time":"2011-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, Hai Lee; Shin, Jin Young; Ju, Mi; Kim, Woo Taek; Kim, Sang Gyung","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2a5acc64887394918d4cf92fa537b35d08fe3e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129854.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466611000378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466611000378; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.02.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21356600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae pneumonia","non-asthmatic children","non-asthmatic patients","severe pneumonia group","severe pneumonia symptoms","group of patients","non-severe group","reduced IL","deficient IL","non-infected controls","chemokines response","common causative agent of pneumonia","selected chemokines","Results Plasma levels of IL","Abstract Purpose Mycoplasma pneumoniae","age-matched controls","years of age","study","asthma status","selected cytokine","CXCL10 responses","known asthma","plasma samples","regulation","activation normal T-cell","relation","symptom severity","mediators","difference","CXCL9","pathogenesis","values","RANTES","ELISA","admission","patient groups","Conclusions","aim","Interleukin","Methods"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about pediatricians\u2019 experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. Methods: Data from a nationally representative survey of AAP post-residency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n=744; response rate=48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which non-users would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. Results: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among non-users, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. Conclusion: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth.

Study design Surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using epidemiologic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogens, including MERS-CoV. Results Among the 125 subjects, 58% tested positive for at least one virus; 47% tested positive for rhino/enterovirus. No cases of MERS-CoV were detected. Conclusions The majority of pilgrims returning to Jordan from the 2014 Hajj with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral etiology, but none were due to MERS-CoV. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections among returning travelers to other countries after Hajj should help optimize surveillance systems and inform public health response practices.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Abdallat, Mohammad Mousa; Rha, Brian; Alqasrawi, Sultan; Payne, Daniel C.; Iblan, Ibrahim; Binder, Alison M.; Haddadin, Aktham; Nsour, Mohannad Al; Alsanouri, Tarek; Mofleh, Jawad; Whitaker, Brett; Lindstrom, Stephen L.; Tong, Suxiang; Ali, Sami Sheikh; Dahl, Rebecca Moritz; Berman, LaShondra; Zhang, Jing; Erdman, Dean D.; Gerber, Susan I.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/659146062766f5f3a552e1542af0825cc0efd443.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106359.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217300252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.01.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28226273/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217300252","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Hajj","MERS-CoV","multiple respiratory pathogens","etiologies of respiratory illnesses","epidemiology of acute respiratory infections","Jordan","returning travelers","majority of pilgrims","cases of MERS","molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens","emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","surveillance systems","enhanced surveillance","Study design Surveillance","sentinel health care facilities","public health response practices","epidemiologic surveys","countries","largest annual mass gatherings","Abstract Background","world","greater understanding","subjects","rhino","enterovirus","Objectives","Conclusions","viral etiology","Results"],"language":"en"},

Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines. RESULT: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens. The antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Antigens were targeted for expression in either the cytoplasm or the outer membrane. Combinations of strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of combined delivery/expression approaches. After investigating in vitro and in vivo antigen expression, growth and infection abilities; the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains was evaluated in mice. Using the soluble model antigen EGFP, our results indicated that vaccine strains with high and stable antigen expression exhibited high B cell responses, whilst eukaryotic expression or colonization with good construct stability was critical for T cell responses. For the insoluble model antigen HA, an outer membrane expression strategy induced better B cell and T cell responses than a cytoplasmic strategy. Most notably, the combination of two different expression strategies did not increase the immune response elicited. CONCLUSION: Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages and deleterious or synergistic effects. Different construction strategies were optimally-required for soluble versus insoluble forms of the protein antigens. If an antigen, such as EGFP, is soluble and expressed at high levels, a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended; since it provokes the highest B cell responses and also induces good T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic expression plasmid or a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective. For insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is recommended.","publish_time":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Song-yue; Yu, Bin; Zhang, Ke; Chen, Min; Hua, Yan-Hong; Yuan, Shuofeng; Watt, Rory M; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Huang, Jian-Dong","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2b90b3519bdcdd02d17595b01c3bb30cb8be63a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3503649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013063/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-13-54","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["EGFP","HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression approaches","cytoplasmic-expression strategy","stable antigen expression","different expression strategies","eukaryotic expression plasmid","outer membrane expression strategy","plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy","high B cell responses","constructed recombinant Salmonella strains","good T cell responses","highest B cell responses","cytoplasmic strategy","protein antigens","model antigens","insoluble antigens","live recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains","series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains","insoluble model antigen HA","soluble model antigen EGFP","better B cell","different antigen delivery","Different construction strategies","high levels","Combinations of strategies","future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines","mice","chromosome","insoluble forms","relative immunogenicity","enhanced green fluorescent protein","immune response","good construct stability","efficacy of combined delivery","colonization","results","H5N1 influenza virus","infection abilities","development of various systems","little work","invaluable guidance","respective advantages","growth","synergistic effects","fragment","hemagglutinin","plasmids","information","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This tightly regulated process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS coronavirus and is critical for their life cycle and virulence.

Here, we developed a high-throughput, fluorescence-based approach to assess the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested \u003E12,000 sequences based on 15 viral and human frameshifting events, allowing us to elucidate the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting in a systematic way and to discover novel regulatory inputs based on amino acid properties and tRNA availability. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing \u003E500 clinical isolates and identified subtype-specific differences as well as associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of gag-pol frameshifting rates. We further devised computational models that accurately predict frameshifting potential (up to auROC=0.93) and frameshifting rates (up to Pearson r=0.81) of novel variants, including subtle differences between HIV clinical isolates (r=0.60). Taken together, this systematic approach can contribute to the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed ribosomal frameshifting.","publish_time":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mikl, Martin; Pilpel, Yitzhak; Segal, Eran","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc65a0655d7b88cade3fbec16f3e9706c4cfc5aa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/636538ce103509c1478bf37718a5ecccec9c3cf9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/469692","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshifting potential","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","human frameshifting events","HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates","HIV clinical isolates","human viruses","systematic approach","fluorescence-based approach","optimality of gag","subtle differences","novel variants","systematic way","viral load","Pearson r","novel regulatory inputs","subtype-specific differences","amino acid properties","testing","feedback control mechanism","translating ribosome","associations","patients","SARS coronavirus","controlled slippage","development of antiviral agents","natural variation","polyamine levels","tRNA availability","auROC","life cycle","high-throughput","alternative frame","virulence","computational models","rules","regulated process","yeast","sequences"],"language":"en"},

This study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. Plasma samples from the HD patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(M0), the following month(M1), and three months after isolation(M3). Parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic DNA(ccf-gDNA), circulating cell-free mitochondria DNA(ccf-mtDNA), and pentraxin-3(PTX-3). Decreased values of Hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. The levels of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were the highest at M0 and decreased gradually in both HD patients and the medical staff. The normalization of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA was significantly delayed in HD patients compared with the response in the medical staff.

METHODS: Age, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte(MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and C-reactive protein(CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the thresholds for five bio-markers, and their prognostic values were assessed via the Kaplan\u2013Meier curve and multivariate COX regression models. RESULTS: The median age was 46.4 years old, and 37cases were females. A total of 26.8% of patients had been to Wuhan, and 73.1% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms. Elevated NLR and age were significantly associated with illness severity. The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98\u20134.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65\u20134.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19. NLR exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.841, with the highest specificity (63.6%) and sensitivity (88%).

All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J.; Netea, Mihai G.; Rovina, Nikoletta; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Damoraki, Georgia; Gkavogianni, Theologia; Adami, Maria-Evangelia; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Ntaganou, Maria; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Koutsodimitropoulos, Ioannis; Velissaris, Dimitrios; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Karageorgos, Athanassios; Katrini, Konstantina; Lekakis, Vasileios; Lupse, Mihaela; Kotsaki, Antigone; Renieris, George; Theodoulou, Danai; Panou, Vassiliki; Koukaki, Evangelia; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Gogos, Charalambos; Koutsoukou, Antonia","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c6ba8d8d1f583c2366f7f5f9e840aa55275cf7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172841.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820302365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320677/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312820302365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","SRF","low HLA-DR expression","circulating lymphocytes","unique pattern of immune dysregulation","unique pattern of immune dysfunction","CD19 lymphocytes","pattern distinct","Proper management of COVID","immune responses","label Tocilizumab treatment of patients","sustained cytokine production","profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes","TNF-\u03B1","blocker Tocilizumab","severe respiratory failure","Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","low human leukocyte antigen D related","lymphopenia","days","initial symptom onset","MAS","patient plasma","natural killer","mandates","macrophage activation syndrome","bacterial sepsis","influenza","NK","hyper-inflammation","SARS-CoV","sudden clinical deterioration","cells","monocytes","interleukin","disease pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions. The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it also reported a number of false-positive or -negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak. In this work, a dual-functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. The two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through nucleic acid hybridization. For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency. The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the in situ hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. Our dual-functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture. This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement and its applicability in the nucleic acid tests and viral disease diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Guangyu; Gai, Zhibo; Tao, Yile; Schmitt, Jean; Kullak-Ublick, Gerd A.; Wang, Jing","journal":"ACS Nano","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d14474e1e53daf13260f8d1c16a96acd3d43e26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158889.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281785/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02439","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LSPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral disease diagnosis","selected sequences","novel coronavirus disease","dual-functional plasmonic biosensor","plasmonic photothermal","selected SARS-CoV","dual-functional LSPR biosensor","sensitive detection","precise detection","localized PPT heat","plasmonic resonance frequency","nucleic acid hybridization","thermoplasmonic heat","clinical COVID","Reliable laboratory diagnosis","similar gene sequences","nucleic acid tests","lower detection limit","novel virus outbreak","public health interventions","sensing transduction","localized surface plasmon resonance","thermoplasmonic enhancement","ongoing outbreak","AuNIs chip","better sensing performance","situ hybridization temperature","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","effect","accurate discrimination","high sensitivity","RT-PCR","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","early stages","promising solution","specific target","concentration","complementary DNA receptors","applicability","negative cases","foremost priorities","study gains insight","reference method","two-dimensional gold nanoislands","number of false","multigene mixture","text","work","Image","threat","countries"],"language":"en"},

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-191,2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Hong; Chen, Xing; Hu, Tao; Li, Juan; Song, Hao; Liu, Yanran; Wang, Peihan; Liu, Di; Yang, Jing; Holmes, Edward C.; Hughes, Alice C.; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Weifeng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab196f5de8cc9813482113a10ca4df39d164655c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cddff59aa11d3d8005e389b47cb7c4501a21d593.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Yunnan Province"],"keyphrases":["bats","closest relative of HCoV","denoted RmYN02","insertion events","novel coronavirus","nucleotide identity","China","low sequence identity","insertion of multiple amino acids","novel bat-derived coronavirus","global scale","recombination events","complete virus genome","junction site","S2 subunits","Spike","S1","public health concern","metagenomics analysis of samples","viruses","contrast","receptor binding domain","Yunnan Province","likely natural hosts","RBD","unprecedented epidemic of pneumonia","strong evidence","origins","wildlife species","ab gene","similar manner","angiotensin","enzyme","ACE2","protein","nature","data"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. RESULTS: 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71\u00B18 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3\u20138) vs. 28 (26\u201329), P \u003C 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P \u003C 0.001) were strong predictors of death.

The clinical presentation of MERS varied from asymptomatic to severe bilateral pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies. There are few studies examining the mortality predictors in this disease. In this study, we examined clinical predictors of mortality of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients to a large tertiary MERS-CoV center in Saudi Arabia over the period from April 2014 to March 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysis was done using a binary regression model. Results A total of 314 symptomatic MERS-CoV patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 48 (\u00B117.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died. The following parameters were associated with increased mortality, age, WBC, neutrophil count, serum albumin level, use of a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 and 3.85, respectively). The use of interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort. Conclusion Several factors contributed to increased mortality in this cohort of MERS-CoV patients. Of these factors, the use of corticosteroid and CRRT were the most significant. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Assiri, Ayed Y.; Alzahrani, Nojoom A.; Alanazi, Amal A.; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adfabd9ea3c5529f334435a6353946e126aed43e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110962.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147789391830382X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147789391830382X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRRT"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["increased mortality","mortality predictors","cohort of MERS","higher mortality","clinical predictors of mortality","corticosteroid use","use of corticosteroid","symptomatic MERS-CoV patients","clinical presentation of MERS","CRRT","factors","use of interferon","large tertiary MERS-CoV center","retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients","studies","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","mark of severe disease","case definition","mean age","severe bilateral pneumonia","high case fatality rate","WBC","neutrophil count","emergence","actual contributors","serum albumin level","continuous renal replacement therapy","Saudi Arabia","infection","odd ratio","period","surveillance strategies","laboratory data","following parameters","ribavirin","Conclusion","total","binary regression model","Abstract Background","Methods","study","years","cases"],"language":"en"},

Multiplex molecular diagnostic techniques have been widely adopted to detect respiratory viruses. We compared the results of a newly upgraded, multiplex, molecular bead-based respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay with the results of Anyplex II RV16 detection kit and AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay. METHODS: We tested 254 respiratory specimens and cultured viral strains using the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Canada) and Anyplex II RV16 detection kit and compared the results. Specimens showing discordant results between the two assays were tested with a AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 254 respiratory specimens, there was total agreement in the results between the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay and the other real-time PCR assay in 94.1\u2013100% of the specimens. The agreement levels were relatively low (94.1\u201397.6%) for specimens of adenovirus, coronavirus NL63, and parainfluenza type 3. In comparison to the other assay, the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay detected a higher number of parainfluenza type 3 (4 cases) and metapneumovirus (9 cases). CONCLUSIONS: The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay showed comparable capabilities compared with the other assays; it will be useful for identifying respiratory viral infections in patients with respiratory symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of the characteristics of the assays they use, since different assays show different detectability for each virus.","publish_time":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Dae-Hyun; Kim, Hyun Soo; Hyun, Jungwon; Kim, Han-Sung; Kim, Jae-Seok; Park, Kyoung Un; Song, Wonkeun","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfb3735e8a8570efe9bc510fb05fe73441b00314.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5500739.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28643489/; https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2017.37.5.408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Anyplex II","Luminex Molecular Diagnostics"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["respiratory specimens","real-time PCR assay","Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay","respiratory viruses","respiratory viral infections","respiratory symptoms","results of Anyplex","respiratory viral panel","AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR assay","discordant results","management of respiratory infections","different assays","specimens of adenovirus","Luminex Molecular Diagnostics","RV16 detection kit","molecular bead","cases","multiplex","cultured viral strains","molecular diagnostic techniques","higher number of parainfluenza type","causative viruses","different detectability","total agreement","agreement levels","Canada","timely diagnosis","comparable capabilities","rapid identification","coronavirus NL63","patients","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","characteristics","Clinicians","metapneumovirus","METHODS","comparison"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDV types O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012 were propagated in baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK21) and titrated then divided into five parts; the first part inactivated with heat, the second part inactivated with gamma radiation, the third part inactivated with UV light, the fourth part inactivated with binary ethylamine, and the last part inactivated with combination of binary ethylamine and formaldehyde (BEI\u002BFA). Evaluate the method of inactivation via inoculation in BHK21, inoculation in suckling baby mice and complement fixation test then formulate vaccine using different methods of inactivation then applying the quality control tests to evaluate each formulated vaccine. RESULTS: The effect of heat, gamma radiation, and UV on the ability of replication of FMDV \u201CO/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012\u201D was determined through BHK cell line passage. Each of the 9 virus aliquots titer 10(8) TCID(50) (3 for each strain) were exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00B0C for 15, 30, and 45 min. Similarly, another 15 aliquots (5 for each strain) contain 1 mm depth of the exposed samples in petri-dish was exposed to UV light (252.7 nm wavelength: One foot distance) for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. Different doses of gamma radiation (10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 KGy) were applied in a dose rate 0.551 Gy/s for each strain and repeated 6 times for each dose. FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) were inactivated when exposed to heat \u226557\u00B0C for 15 min. The UV inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2) was obtained within 60 min and 65 min for type A/Iran05. The ideal dose for inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) with gamma radiation were 55-60 and 45 kGy, respectively. Inactivation of FMDV with binary was 20, 24 and 16 hr for O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively while inactivation by (BEI\u002BFA) was determined after 18, 19 and 11 hr for O/pan-Asia, A/Iran 05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively. The antigenicity of control virus before inactivation was 1/32, it was not changed after inactivation in case of gamma radiation and (BEI\u002BFA) and slightly decrease to 1/16 in case of binary and declined to 1/2, 1/4 in case of heat and UV inactivation, respectively. The immune response induced by inactivated FMD vaccines by gamma radiation and (BEI\u002BFA) lasted to 9 months post-vaccination, while the binary only still up to 8 months post-vaccination but heat and UV-inactivated vaccines were not effective. CONCLUSION: Gamma radiation could be considered a good new inactivator inducing the same results of inactivated vaccine by binary with formaldehyde (BEI\u002BFA).","publish_time":"2015-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahdy, Safy El din; Hassanin, Amr Ismail; Gamal El-Din, Wael Mossad; Ibrahim, Ehab El-Sayed; Fakhry, Hiam Mohamed","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6b06d62a3af9c36824d3c674f4d43d6d78d9073.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4774778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27047204/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2015.1088-1098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["O/pan Asia","BEI FA","BHK"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["UV inactivation of FMDV","pan Asia","pan-Asia","Iran05","UV-inactivated vaccines","case of gamma radiation","different methods of inactivation","method of inactivation","FMDV types O","Different doses of gamma radiation","BEI","FA","results of inactivated vaccine","inactivated FMD vaccines","production of inactivated vaccines","serotypes O","UV light","case of binary","case of heat","effect of heat","combination of binary ethylamine","strain","traditional methods","exposed samples","antigenicity of control virus","inoculation","BHK21","formaldehyde","formulated vaccine","months post-vaccination","hr","virus aliquots titer","dose rate","ideal dose","KGy","mouth disease virus","foot distance","antigenicity of viruses","suckling baby mice","quality control tests","baby hamster kidney","fixation test","present work deals","nm wavelength","petri-dish","ability of replication","good new inactivator","effects","depth","immune response","comparison","MATERIALS","BHK cell line passage","AIM","TCID","times","CONCLUSION","parts"],"language":"en"},

Lung ultrasound maybe a first-line alternative to chest X-ray and CT scan in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. We describe the use of lung ultrasound imaging and findings in two cases of severe respiratory failure from avian influenza A (H7N9) infection. METHODS: Serial lung ultrasound images and video from two cases of H7N9 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a tertiary care intensive care unit were analyzed for characteristic lung ultrasound findings described previously for respiratory failure and infection. These findings were followed serially, correlated with clinical course and chest X-ray. RESULTS: In both patients, characteristic lung ultrasound findings have been observed as previously described in viral pulmonary infections: subpleural consolidations associated or not with local pleural effusion. In addition, numerous, confluent, or coalescing B-lines leading to \u2018white lung\u2019 with corresponding pleural line thickening are associated with ARDS. Extension or reduction of lesions observed with ultrasound was also correlated respectively with clinical worsening or improvement. Coexisting consolidated pneumonia with sonographic air bronchograms was noted in one patient who did not survive. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians with access to point-of-care ultrasonography may use these findings as an alternative to chest X-ray or CT scan. Lung ultrasound imaging may assist in the efficient allocation of intensive care for patients with respiratory failure from viral pulmonary infections, especially in resource scarce settings or situations such as future respiratory virus outbreaks or pandemics.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Nga Wing; Ngai, Chun Wai; Mok, Ka Leung; Tsung, James W","journal":"Crit Ultrasound J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08885e2da682c5d027e986aacc166975e01fc60c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4051407.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949191/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2036-7902-6-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["characteristic lung ultrasound findings","use of lung ultrasound imaging","white lung","Serial lung ultrasound images","cases of H7N9 respiratory failure","cases of severe respiratory failure","viral pneumonia","chest X-ray","acute respiratory distress syndrome","future respiratory virus outbreaks","care ultrasonography","tertiary care intensive care unit","viral pulmonary infections","efficient allocation of intensive care","ill patients","line alternative","CT scan","consolidated pneumonia","ARDS","corresponding pleural line thickening","clinical course","clinical worsening","local pleural effusion","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","mechanical ventilation","situations","video","avian influenza","resource scarce settings","subpleural consolidations","confluent","point","coalescing B-lines","sonographic air bronchograms","access","pandemics","METHODS","various pathologies","CONCLUSIONS","Clinicians","reduction of lesions","Extension","addition","improvement","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu","journal":"Cell Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb030202bbf50ba56922ea88b06dc78327028b26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118126.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231345/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","pseudovirus infection","viral infection","treatment of infection","S protein-mediated membrane fusion","potent fusion inhibitor","pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor","cell fusion assay","HR1 domain","human coronavirus pseudoviruses","superior plasma membrane fusion capacity","protein-mediated cell","S protein S2 subunit","divergent human coronaviruses","live human coronaviruses","Intranasal application of EK1C4","specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","original EK1 peptide","emerging SARSr-CoVs","HR2 domains","prophylactics","serious threat","mutated amino acid residues","molecular mechanism","helical bundle","challenge","core","mice","COVID","IC50s","spike","HCoV-OC43","enhanced interactions","global public health","HB","China","replication","Wuhan","X-ray crystal structure","fold","prevention","series of lipopeptides","nM"],"language":"en"},

An entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. Nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis were detected from swab samples using PCR assays. Blood samples were tested for antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) by ELISA tests. Antibodies against H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 Swine Influenza Viruses (SIV) of European lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. The results indicated that S. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of PCR-positive sows). A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, and H. parasuis were detected by PCR in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. Antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. Although PCV-2 and SIV infections were highly prevalent, the PRRSV infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. The sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fablet, C.; Marois, C.; Kuntz-Simon, G.; Rose, N.; Dorenlor, V.; Eono, F.; Eveno, E.; Jolly, J.

A synopsis of the known data is used to propose a molecular model of the mechanism involved and for the role of the pseudoknot. This latter structure is able to recruit 30S ribosomal subunits to initiate translation, but also to bind S15 and to stop translation by trapping the ribosome on its loading site. Information on the S15 protein recognition of the messenger RNA site was deduced from mutational analyses and chemical probinb. A comparison of this messenger site with the S15 ribosomal binding site was conducted by analysing hydroxyl radical footprintings of these two sites. The existence of two subsites in 16S RNA suggests that the ribosomal protein S15 might present either two different binding sites or at least one common subsite. Clues for the presence of a common site between the messenger and 16S RNA are given which cannot rule out that recognition specificity is linked to a few other determinants.

Recently we have shown that a set of nine synthetic antimicrobial peptides, four originating from thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins named PD1\u2013PD4 and five synthetic repeats of arginine-tryptophan (RW) repeats (RW1-5) demonstrate antibacterial activity in plasma and platelets. Using WR strain of vaccinia virus (VV) as a model virus for enveloped virus in the present study, we tested the same nine synthetic peptides for their antiviral activity. A cell culture-based standard plaque reduction assay was utilized to estimate antiviral effectiveness of the peptides. Our analysis revealed that peptides PD3, PD4, and RW3 were virucidal against VV with PD3 demonstrating the highest antiviral activity of 100-fold reduction in viral titers, whereas, PD4 and RW3 peptide treatments resulted in 10\u201330-fold reduction. The EC50 values of PD3, PD4 and RW3 were found to be 40\u03BCg/ml, 50\u03BCg/ml and 6.5\u03BCM, respectively. In VV-spiked plasma samples, the virucidal activity of PD3, PD4 and RW3 was close to 100% (90\u2013100-fold reduction).

The role of respiratory viral infection is just emerging. We wished to determine prospectively the incidence of viral infection in exacerbated and stable COPD patients as well as smokers who do not have airways obstruction. Methods Stable and exacerbated COPD patients were recruited along with a group of patients who had smoked but who did not have any airways obstruction. Spirometry was performed and sputum specimens were tested for a range of 12 different respiratory viruses using PCR. Results One hundred and thirty-six patients with exacerbations of COPD, 68 stable COPD patients and 16 non-obstructed smokers were recruited. A respiratory virus was detected in 37% of exacerbations, 12% of stable COPD patients and 12% of non-obstructed smokers, p \u003C0.0005. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected. The symptom of fever was associated with virus detection, p \u003C0.05. Infection with more than one virus was only found in the exacerbated COPD patients. Conclusion Respiratory viral infection is associated with exacerbations of COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common infecting agent identified and in two cases human metapneumovirus was also detected. Dual infections were only seen amongst those patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD. Viruses were more commonly detected in those with more severe airways disease.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McManus, Terence E.; Marley, Anne-Marie; Baxter, Noreen; Christie, Sharon N.; O\u0027Neill, Hugh J.; Elborn, J.

TGEV infection provokes mitochondrial damage of porcine intestinal epthelial cell (IPEC), which is responsible for inflammation and cell death. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that circular RNA circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection and promoted the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03BAB) via targeting miR-22 in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Activation of NF-\u03BAB is an important factor for mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is a key reason for mitochondrial damage. So, we speculate that circEZH2 may regulate TGEV-induced mPTP opening via NF-kB pathway. In the present study, we found that mPTP opening of IPEC-J2 was occured during TGEV infection and suppressed by circEZH2 via attaching miR-22. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were identified as the targets of miR-22. Silencing HK2 enhanced TGEV-induced mPTP opening, while no effect on NF-\u03BAB pathway. Silencing IL-6 promoted TGEV-induced mPTP opening and inhibited NF-\u03BAB pathway. Inhibitor of NF-\u03BAB increased TGEV-induced mPTP opening. The data revealed that TGEV-induced mPTP opening was regulated via two pathways: circEZH2/miR-22/HK2 axis and circEZH2/miR-22/IL-6/NF-\u03BAB axis.","publish_time":"2019-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaomin; Ma, Xuelian; Guo, Jianxiong; Mi, Mi; Wang, Kaili; Zhang, Chuyi; Tang, Xiaoyi; Chang, Lingling; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4f28354c6015236a080fc0d67b0fc9d193c70d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6775298.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.36532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-induced mPTP opening","TGEV infection","promoted TGEV-induced mPTP","\u03BAB increased TGEV-induced mPTP","NF-\u03BAB axis","Silencing HK2 enhanced TGEV-induced mPTP","Activation of NF","inhibited NF-\u03BAB pathway","Inhibitor of NF","targeting miR","attaching miR","targets of miR","mitochondrial damage of porcine intestinal epthelial cell","IPEC-J2","HK2 axis","Silencing IL","circular RNA circEZH2","cell death","porcine intestinal epithelial cell line","Mitochondrial permeability transition pore","transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","important factor","present study","previous study","activation of nuclear factor kappa-light","chain-enhancer","activated B cells","key reason","severe vomiting","effect","diarrhea of swine","infectious disease","piglet","pathways","inflammation","interleukin","data","Hexokinase"],"language":"en"},

Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munayco, C\u00E9sar V.; Tariq, Amna; Rothenberg, Richard; Soto-Cabezas, Gabriela G.; Reyes, Mary F.; Valle, Andree; Rojas-Mezarina, Leonardo; Cabezas, C\u00E9sar; Loayza, Manuel; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0e7ddbfdcd6bd36c8097176497527c2042e7fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215155.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399507/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300130?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300130; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan China","Latin America","Brazil","Peru"],"keyphrases":["effect of social distancing interventions","Lima","broad scale social distancing interventions","range of social distancing measures","early transmission dynamics","early COVID","reported cases","daily number of new COVID","exponential growth dynamics","exponential growth trend","disease transmission","early transmission phase","autochthonous cases","transmission rate","daily trend","reproduction number","Peru","linear growth trend","date of symptoms onset","daily series","place","mean scaling of growth parameter","active case","local incidence curve","efforts","short-term forecasts","substantial morbidity","school closures","Wuhan China","mortality impact","world","confirmation","novel coronavirus","pandemic","great majority","spread","Brazil","need","implementation","analysis","Latin America","region","months","government","country"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines available to control PDCoV. To study the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PDCoV infection, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids (pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) that targeted the M and N genes of PDCoV were constructed and transfected separately into swine testicular (ST) cells, which were then infected with PDCoV strain HB-BD. The potential of the plasmids to inhibit PDCoV replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, virus titers, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The cytopathogenicity assays demonstrated that pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N protected ST cells against pathological changes with high specificity and efficacy. The 50% tissue culture infective dose showed that the PDCoV titers in ST cells treated with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were reduced 13.2- and 32.4-fold, respectively.

This is believed to be the first report to show that shRNAs targeting the M and N genes of PDCoV exert antiviral effects in vitro, which suggests that RNAi is a promising new strategy against PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Wen-yuan; Li, Yan; Liu, Bao-jing; Wang, Jing; Yuan, Guang-fu; Chen, Shao-jie; Zuo, Yu-Zhu; Fan, Jing-Hui","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/435b2c1a312dad2b0d70591efe688612cc47fe19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088929.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463771/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-019-01701-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV infection","N genes of PDCoV","PDCoV titers","PDCoV replication","pGenesil-N protected ST cells","PDCoV strain HB-","viral RNA","RNAi","potential of RNA interference","plasmids","real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay","short hairpin RNA","post-infection mortality","virus titers","promising new strategy","cell cultures pre-transfected","pathological changes","high specificity","cytopathic effect","intestinal diseases","neonatal piglets","diarrhea","dehydration","antiviral effects","tissue culture infective dose","efficacy","vaccines available","effective treatments","swine testicular","shRNAs","cytopathogenicity assays","Porcine deltacoronavirus","report","fold"],"language":"en"},

As such, they can be exploited to make cells produce a desired protein, or to shut down the expression of endogenous genes or even to repair defective genes. Hence, nucleic acids are unique substances for research and therapy. To exploit their potential, they need to be delivered into cells which can be a challenging task in many respects. During the last decade, nanomagnetic methods for delivering and targeting nucleic acids have been developed, methods which are often referred to as magnetofection. In this review we summarize the progress and achievements in this field of research. We discuss magnetic formulations of vectors for nucleic acid delivery and their characterization, mechanisms of magnetofection, and the application of magnetofection in viral and nonviral nucleic acid delivery in cell culture and in animal models. We summarize results that have been obtained with using magnetofection in basic research and in preclinical animal models. Finally, we describe some of our recent work and end with some conclusions and perspectives.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plank, Christian; Zelphati, Olivier; Mykhaylyk, Olga","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b61183e326bb556ea31f49b764de2b1f95ad3b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103316.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2011.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21893135/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X11002250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X11002250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Nucleic acids","nonviral nucleic acid delivery","application of magnetofection","mechanisms of magnetofection","basic research","field of research","cells","preclinical animal models","defective genes","nanomagnetic methods","expression of endogenous genes","cell culture","unique substances","characterization","building plans of living systems","magnetic formulations of vectors","conclusions","achievements","progress","recent work","challenging task","therapy","respects","review","perspectives","desired protein","decade","potential","results"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Fourteen 28-week-old male New Zealand white rabbits received one intravenous injection of LPS (10 \u03BCg/kg). 24 h later, three injections of 20 mg/kg of MPS were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 h. Additional 6 rabbits were used as controls. Dynamic MRI was performed on bilateral femora for local intraosseous perfusion before and after LPS injection. Blood samples were collected for hematological examinations before and after LPS injection. Bilateral femora were dissected and decalcified for microCT-based microangiography. ON lesion, intravascular thrombus and extravascular marrow fat cell size were examined histopathologically. Results: Intravascular thrombus was observed in all ON rabbits. Extravascular marrow fat cell size was significantly increased in ON rabbits than that of the controls (P \u003C0.05). Compared to baseline, a significant decrease in ratio of tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, activated partial thromboplatin time and a significant increase in ratio of low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein were only found in ON rabbits (P \u003C0.05). Dynamic MRI showed a significant decrease in the perfusion index \u2018maximum enhancement\u2019 in the ON rabbits (P \u003C0.05), and microCT-based microangiography showed blocked stem vessels in ON samples. Overall, 93% of the rabbits (13/14) developed ON, and no rabbits died throughout the experiment period. Conclusion: Both intra- and extravascular events were found attributing to the steroid-associated ON based on our experimental protocol with a single low-dose LPS injection and subsequent three injections of high-dose MPS. Both high ON incidence and no mortality in rabbits treated with this inductive protocol suggested its effectiveness for future studies on evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of interventions developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, L.; Zhang, G.; Sheng, H.; Yeung, K.

We assessed the education activities and communication resources available for this purpose in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals. METHODS: We selected a 20% (n=1236) random sample of hospitals from the 2000 American Hospital Association database, stratified by bed size, service, metropolitan statistical sampling area (MSSA), and region to ensure representativeness. Infection control professionals (ICPs) at the hospitals were asked to complete a Web-based questionnaire during October 21\u2013December 22, 2003. RESULTS: ICPs at 556 (45%) hospitals completed the survey, including 518 (93%) general medical-surgical, 20 (4%) other specialty (including oncology), and 18 (3%) children\u0027s hospitals; 352 (63%) were in urban (\u003C100,000 population) areas and 224 (40%) had \u003C100 beds. Most hospitals had provided educational programs about infection control issues related to smallpox (87%), smallpox vaccine-related adverse events (76%), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (75%); and anthrax (73%). Fewer offered programs on monkeypox (27%). Hospitals reported that the best ways to disseminate information to them were via e-mail (97%), Web sites or group e-mail lists (72%), videoconference (40%), or teleconference (35%). Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to identify Web sites (p=0.001) and videoconference (p=0.03) as the best ways to receive information. Hospitals used e-mail (94%), teleconferencing (72%), Web-based training (61%), computer-based tools (50%), and videoconferencing (46%) to reach hospital-based clinical personnel. Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to use e-mail (p=0.01) to reach personnel. Hospitals identified model preparedness plans (61%), educational materials for personnel (54%) or patients/public (40%), and tabletop exercises/drills (46%) as being most helpful to preparedness efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals may differ substantially in preparedness and response readiness. These findings will assist in determining the best strategies for communicating with hospitals and providing information to assist them in preparedness efforts.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolyard\u2217, E.; Scott, R.

There is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in South-East Asia. Such data are important for future management of respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in those hospitalised in South-East Asia. METHODS: Respiratory specimens archived from July 2008 to June 2009 from patients hospitalised with suspected influenza from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were tested for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 1222 patients\u2019 samples were tested. Of 1222, 776 patients (63\u00B75%) were under the age of 5. Viruses detected included rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (18\u00B77%), bocaviruses in 200 (16\u00B74%), respiratory syncytial viruses in 144 (11\u00B78%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (11\u00B75%; PIV1: 32; PIV2: 12; PIV3: 71; PIV4: 25), adenovirus in 102 (8\u00B74%), influenza viruses in 93 (7\u00B76%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16) and coronaviruses in 23 (1\u00B78%; OC43: 14; E229: 9). Bacterial pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 33, 2\u00B77%), Chlamydophila psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), Bordetella pertussis (n = 1) and Legionella pneumophila (n = 2). Overall, in-hospital case fatality rate was 29 of 1222 (2\u00B74%). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were the most commonly detected pathogens in patients hospitalised with a clinical suspicion of influenza. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus, and M. pneumoniae, the most common atypical bacterium. The low number of detected influenza viruses demonstrates a low benefit for empirical oseltamivir therapy, unless during an influenza outbreak.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wertheim, Heiman F L; Nadjm, Behzad; Thomas, Sherine; Malik, Suhud; Nguyen, Diep Ngoc Thi; Vu, Dung Viet Tien; Van Nguyen, Kinh; Van Nguyen, Chau Vinh; Nguyen, Liem Thanh; Tran, Sinh Thi; Phung, Thuy Bich Thi; Nguyen, Trung Vu; Hien, Tran Tinh; Nguyen, Uyen Hanh; Taylor, Walter; Truong, Khanh Huu; Ha, Tuan Manh; Chokephaibulkit, Kulkanya; Farrar, Jeremy; Wolbers, Marcel; de Jong, Menno D; van Doorn, H Rogier; Puthavathana, Pilaipan","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8f484e668a71d016a40b1fd1de16fbf2e539ebe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4605413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25980749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C. pneumoniae","Bordetella","M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South-East Asia","Indonesia","Thailand","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","suspected influenza","influenza B","influenza outbreak","low number of detected influenza viruses","respiratory syncytial viruses","clinical suspicion of influenza","parainfluenza viruses","detected pathogens","Respiratory specimens","detected virus","hospitalised adults","future management of respiratory infections","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","aetiology of infection","South-East Asia","low benefit","atypical bacteria","Bacterial pathogens","common atypical bacterium","empirical oseltamivir therapy","polymerase chain reaction","Indonesia","Thailand","children","Vietnam","leading cause of morbidity","total","hospital case fatality rate","mortality","data","limited information","BACKGROUND","Bordetella pertussis","Legionella pneumophila","included rhinoviruses","patients\u2019 samples","Chlamydophila psittaci","PIV2","PIV4","PIV3","RESULTS","METHODS","coronaviruses","CONCLUSION","OC43","E229","PIV1","adenovirus","OBJECTIVES","bocaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Infectious patients presenting to emergency departments bring a risk of cross-infection to other patients and staff through close proximity interactions or contacts. To understand factors associated with cross-infection risk, we measured close proximity interactions of emergency department staff and patients by radiofrequency identification in a working emergency department. The number of contacts (degree) is not related to patient demographic characteristics. However, the amount of time in close proximity (weighted degree) of patients with ED personnel did differ, with black patients having approximately 15min more contact with staff than non-white patients. Patients arriving by EMS had fewer contacts with other patients than patients arriving by other means. There are differences in the number of contacts based on staff role and arrival mode. When crowding is low, providers have the most contact time with patients, while administrative staff have the least. However, when crowding is high, this differential is reversed. The effect of arrival mode is modified by the extent of crowding. When crowding is low, patients arriving by EMS had longer contact with administrative staff, compared to patients arriving by other means. However, when crowding is high, patients arriving by EMS had less contact with administrative staff compared to patients arriving by other means. Our findings should help designers of emergency care focus on higher risk situations for transmission of dangerous pathogens in an emergency department.

Exosomes contain cell and cell-state specific cargos of protein, mRNA and miRNA. Exosome formation, cargo content, and delivery to surrounding cells is of immense biological interest considering the role that exosomes are believed to play in various pathological conditions. They aid antigen presentation by immune cells and can exhibit either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory properties depending on the parent antigen-presenting cell\u0027s conditioning. Viruses can hijack a host cell\u0027s exosomal machinery to evade host defense systems aiding in the trans-infection of viruses. Tumor derived exosomes may help establish an oncogenic niche systemically via delivery of protein, mRNA, and miRNA that can aid angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Exosomes have also been implicated in the spread of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have shown that exosomes are selectively taken up by cells distal from their release. They can reprogram the recipient cells due to their active molecular cargo. Cell-lineage and state-specific exosomes imply that they may therefore harbor body fluid-based biomarkers of unparalleled accuracy, particularly for tissues that are difficult or impossible to access. Exosome-specific membrane proteins provide markers enabling exosome identity and selection, while cell type and cell condition-specific protein, mRNA and miRNA cargo provide a rich potential source of biomarkers. This review serves to provide an overview of the current state of the science in the burgeoning field of exosome biology.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pant, Saumya; Hilton, Holly; Burczynski, Michael E.","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5aa7887809535108db0ddf97e4634ce14b02116.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110994.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295211009531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230477/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295211009531; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["state-specific exosomes","cell type","cell proliferation","Cell-lineage","cell survival","Abstract Exosomes","cell condition-specific protein","cell-state specific cargos of protein","Tumor derived exosomes","mRNA","miRNA cargo","Exosome-specific membrane proteins","delivery of protein","exosome identity","Exosome formation","immune cells","recipient cells","cells distal","cargo content","cell\u0027s conditioning","current state","cell\u0027s endosomal membrane system","host cell\u0027s exosomal machinery","burgeoning field of exosome biology","active molecular cargo","surrounding body fluids","parent antigen","antigen presentation","host defense systems","body fluid-based biomarkers of unparalleled accuracy","trans-infection of viruses","rich potential source of biomarkers","selection","bioactive vesicles","science","pro-inflammatory properties","oncogenic niche","tissues","angiogenesis","overview","role","various pathological conditions","spread of neurodegenerative diseases","release","review","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Mice in C-RELAP group showed a delayed recovery of voiding function. In vitro contractility studies determined a decreased basal detrusor tone and reduced amplitude of nerve-mediated contractions in C-RELAP group, whereas C-PRO group had elevated muscle-mediated contractions.

This study aimed to assess the performances of tests carried out in vivo or at postmortem examination in challenging cases in which FIP was confirmed or excluded based on IHC or on adequate follow\u2010up. Methods: Twelve cases (four without FIP, eight with FIP) were retrospectively studied.

Sensitivity, specificity and concordance (\u03BA) with the final diagnosis were calculated. Results: Concordance was absent for serology (\u03BA=\u22120\u00B708) and AE (\u03BA=\u22120\u00B752), poor for histopathology (\u03BA=0\u00B709), fair for SPE (\u03BA=0\u00B725) and perfect for AGP (\u03BA=1\u00B700).

Human-to-human transmission requires close contact, and has typically occurred in the healthcare setting. Improved global awareness, together with improved hygiene practices in healthcare facilities, has been highlighted as key strategies in controlling the spread of MERS-CoV. This study tested the in vitro efficacy of three formulations of povidone iodine (PVP-I: 4% PVP-I skin cleanser, 7.5% PVP-I surgical scrub, and 1% PVP-I gargle/mouthwash) against a reference virus (Modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA) and MERS-CoV. METHODS: According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used to assess virucidal activity against MVA and large volume plating was used for MERS-CoV. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L bovine serum albumin, BSA) and dirty conditions (3.0 g/L BSA \u002B 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes), with application times of 15, 30, and 60 s for MVA, and 15 s for MERS-CoV. The products were tested undiluted, 1:10 and 1:100 diluted against MVA, and undiluted against MERS-CoV. RESULTS: A reduction in virus titer of \u22654 log(10) (corresponding to an inactivation of \u226599.99%) was regarded as evidence of virucidal activity. This was achieved versus MVA and MERS-CoV, under both clean and dirty conditions, within 15 s of application of each undiluted PVP-I product. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that PVP-I-based hand wash products for potentially contaminated skin, and PVP-I gargle/mouthwash for reduction of viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx, may help to support hygiene measures to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV.

RNAi effect is obtained at low siRNA doses with a unique kinetic profile. Furthermore, the solid dispersion technique is utilized to formulate PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes into solid formulations that are as active as the freshly prepared nanocomplexes in solution. Importantly, the nanocomplexes are stable and active in mediating RNAi response after incubation with simulated gastric fluid (SGF) that is highly acidic.

Generation of TCR Tg mice generally requires T cell stimulation and cloning in vitro prior to amplification, processes which introduce biases into selection of the TCR that is ultimately chosen for TCR Tg mouse generation. Here we describe an alternative approach that involves no T cell stimulation or propagation in vitro. We generated mice that were transgenic for a TCR responding to a CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133) that is immunodominant in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus, the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. The CD4 T cell response to epitope M133 is of particular interest because it may be pathogenic, protective or regulatory, depending upon the physiological setting. We applied an iterative process in which we identified a TCR-\u03B2 chain expressed by all mice that were examined (\u2018public sequence\u2019). This TCR-\u03B2 chain was introduced into bone marrow cells with a lentivirus vector, generating TCR-\u03B2 retrogenic mice. A TCR-\u03B1 chain that paired with this TCR-\u03B2 was then identified and used to generate a second set of TCR (\u03B1/\u03B2) retrogenic mice. After demonstrating that these cells were functional and responded to epitope M133, these TCR chains were used to generate an epitope M133-specific TCR Tg mouse. This method should be generally useful for engineering TCR Tg mice without introduction of bias caused by in vitro manipulation and propagation.","publish_time":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jingxian; Fett, Craig; Pewe, Lecia; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d488d97d9ce77bbe110b5723ec3c83119793a4ab.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24c9985dfabc010c381bee3b22324dadb1214d69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3850057.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2013.07.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175913002093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23928495/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175913002093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCR Tg"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TCR chains","set of TCR","TCR-\u03B2 chain","Generation of TCR Tg mice","TCR-\u03B2 retrogenic mice","engineering TCR Tg mice","TCR-\u03B1 chain","TCR Tg mouse generation","T cell stimulation","epitope M133-specific TCR Tg mouse","CD4 T cell epitope","T cell receptor","CD4 T cell response","longitudinal T cell responses","propagation","JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","bone marrow cells","memory phases","effector","lentivirus vector","introduction of bias","neurotropic coronavirus","expression","biases","amplification","immunodominant","alternative approach","processes","manipulation","selection","physiological setting","method","public sequence","iterative process"],"language":"en"},

Viruses have been the focus of most host shift studies, so less is known about the importance of ecological versus evolutionary processes to successful bacterial host shifts. Here we tested whether direct contact with the novel host was sufficient to enable the mid-1990s jump of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). We experimentally inoculated house finches with two genetically distinct M. gallisepticum strains obtained either from poultry (Rlow) or from house finches (HF1995) during an epizootic outbreak. All 15 house finches inoculated with HF1995 became infected, whereas Rlow successfully infected 12 of 15 (80%) inoculated house finches. Comparisons among infected birds showed that, relative to HF1995, Rlow achieved substantially lower bacterial loads in the host respiratory mucosa and was cleared faster. Furthermore, Rlow-infected finches were less likely to develop clinical symptoms than HF1995-infected birds and, when they did, displayed milder conjunctivitis. The lower infection success of Rlow relative to HF1995 was not, however, due to a heightened host antibody response to Rlow. Taken together, our results indicate that contact between infected poultry and house finches was not, by itself, sufficient to explain the jump of M. gallisepticum to house finches. Instead, mutations arising in the original poultry host would have been necessary for successful pathogen emergence in the novel finch host.","publish_time":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Staley, Molly; Hill, Geoffrey E.; Josefson, Chloe C.; Armbruster, Jonathan W.; Bonneaud, Camille","journal":"Infect Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f88c05ff539e0fd17ef61d08a51757f1e93b55a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5820954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29311238/; https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00863-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rlow"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rlow-infected finches","inoculated house finches","novel host","original poultry host","infected poultry","HF1995-infected birds","novel finch host","original donor host","host respiratory mucosa","new host species","host shift studies","successful bacterial host shifts","heightened host antibody response","domestic poultry","direct contact","lower infection success of Rlow relative","gallisepticum strains","s jump","lower bacterial loads","bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum","successful pathogen emergence","adaptive mutations","evolutionary processes","clinical symptoms","cases","Haemorhous mexicanus","importance of ecological","focus","results","epizootic outbreak","Comparisons","milder conjunctivitis","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

However, we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other IV strains that are able to cross the species barrier. In this work, we extended our investigations into whether different IV strains able to cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune responses that could be associated with pathological lesions. For this purpose, we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours, in which healthy pigs had been infected with a H3N2 Swine IV and four different H3N8 IV strains circulating in different animal species. Pigs had been clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 21 days post infection. In the present study, all groups but mock exhibited antibody responses to IV nucleoprotein protein. Pulmonary lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs infected with the swine-adapted virus. Interestingly, pigs infected with avian and seal H3N8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral replication, whereas equine and canine IVs did not cause overt pathological signs, and replication was barely detectable. Swine IV infection induced interferon (IFN)-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) at day 3 post infection, as opposed to the other non-swine-adapted virus strains. However, IFN-alpha responses to the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the local, constitutive expression of IFN-alpha genes. Remarkably, the Equine strain gave rise to a Serum Amyloid A response in BALF despite little if any replication. Each virus strain could be associated with expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection. These responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication, suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune system.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montoya, Mar\u00EDa; Foni, Emanuela; Sol\u00F3rzano, Alicia; Razzuoli, Elisabetta; Baratelli, Massimiliano; Bilato, Dania; C\u00F3rdoba, Lorena; del Burgo, Maria Angeles Mart\u00EDn; Martinez, Jorge; Martinez-Orellana, Pamela; Chiapponi, Chiara; Perlin, David S.; del Real, Gustavo; Amadori, Massimo","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f10e409ed733f8ca5e49e4ebd0482663328f2267.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5399951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IV","Swine IV"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["IV strains","Swine IV infection","H3N2 Swine IV","non-swine-adapted virus strains","period of virus replication","IFN-alpha responses","strains able","different innate immune responses","current circulating swine influenza virus","different H3N8","healthy pigs","seal H3N8 strains","different animal species","pathological lesions","alpha genes","species barrier","days post infection","high-titered viral replication","BALF","rise","mock exhibited antibody responses","constitutive expression of IFN","moderate lesions","Pulmonary lesions","Equine strain","innate immune system","expression of cytokine genes","present study","previous study","overt pathological signs","prolonged homeostatic imbalance","groups","Serum Amyloid","canine IVs","subtypes","bronchoalveolar fluids","interleukin","interferon","nucleoprotein protein","H1N1","H1N2","Europe","increase","investigations","samples","proteins","clinical outbreaks of disease","subjects","purpose","work"],"language":"en"},

This recognition has fueled efforts for the discovery of effective therapeutics. While recent progress in drug discovery has been encouraging, there are presently no acceptably effective parasite-specific drugs for the disease. The urgent need for new drug discovery or drug repurposing has also increased the need for refined animal models of clinical disease for therapeutic efficacy evaluation. Here, we describe an acute model of cryptosporidiosis using newborn calves to evaluate well-defined clinical and parasitological parameter outcomes, including the effect on diarrhea severity and duration, oocyst numbers produced, and multiple measures of clinical health. The model is highly reproducible and provides unequivocal direct measures of treatment efficacy on diarrhea severity and parasite replication.","publish_time":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riggs, Michael W.; Schaefer, Deborah A.","journal":"Cryptosporidium","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a57c31bad343aa4a03d532c7821975b3e7e27ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120472.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452167/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9748-0_15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new drug discovery","diarrhea severity","drug repurposing","parasite replication","discovery of effective therapeutics","refined animal models of clinical disease","multiple measures of clinical health","effective parasite-specific drugs","severe diarrheal disease","acute model of cryptosporidiosis","urgent need","apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum","unequivocal direct measures of treatment efficacy","therapeutic efficacy evaluation","newborn calves","oocyst numbers","parasitological parameter outcomes","duration","world","mortality","livestock","resource-limited parts","humans","efforts","leading causes of morbidity","AIDS","recent progress","malnourished individuals","recognition"],"language":"en"},

Emerging technologies present an opportunity for addressing global health challenges\u2014in both developed and developing countries. Health issues ripe for the application of new technologies include disease surveillance and control, environmental monitoring and pollution prevention, food safety, health behavior change, self-care, population screening, and chronic disease and injury prevention and control. If appropriately applied, population health technologies may greatly enhance existing health intervention models. However, potential adverse consequences could arise related to privacy, confidentiality, and security; quality and effectiveness; sustainability; and the technology divide.

Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying comorbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the U.S. METHODS: UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multihospital health care system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the health care system leadership. RESULTS: In this publication, we share our multifaceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, intensive care units, and acute care services. The strategy focuses on key content areas, including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members. CONCLUSION: Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our health care systems. We share our experiences of developing such a strategy to help other institutions conduct and adapt such strategies more quickly.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fausto, James; Hirano, Lianne; Lam, Daniel; Mehta, Amisha; Mills, Blair; Owens, Darrell; Perry, Elizabeth; Curtis, J.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological results as well as treatment outcome data were obtained. ARDS was defined as oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) \u2264 300mmHg. Findings Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR=1.078, P=0.008) and high BMI (OR=1.327, P=0.024) were independent risk factor associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (SBP) level (OR=1.046, P=0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR=1.010, P=0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients were conducted CT scan repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in disease exacerbation group (n=19) and disease relieve group (n=51). High BMI (OR=1.285, P=0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR=16.13, P=0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment. Implications Our results help to risk stratification in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Tao; Cai, Shaohang; Zheng, Zhidan; Cai, Xuejuan; Liu, Yuanyuan; Yin, Sichun; Peng, Jie; Xu, Xuwen","journal":"Clin Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c6f1888177420011ff0c6e714490bb9216898d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362344/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291820301971?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291820301971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","independent risk factors","ARDS","novel coronavirus disease","disease exacerbation group","disease progression","high BMI","COVID","clinical outcome","level","pneumonia","high lactate dehydrogenase","treatment outcome data","total","high systolic blood pressure","cross-sectional multicenter clinical study","Findings Multivariate analysis","radiological results","Abstract Purpose","nCoV infection","acute respiratory distress syndrome","PCR detection of target genes","diagnostic standard","SBP","timely intervention","older age","PaO2","FiO2","oxygenation index","LDH","stratification","CT scan","Methods","laboratory","tobacco smoking","mmHg","Implications"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this prospective study, specimens and demographic and clinical data were collected from adults admitted with respiratory symptoms to 4 hospitals during the 8\u201310 peak weeks of 2 influenza seasons. Specimens were systematically tested for influenza and 13 other respiratory viruses (ORVs) by using the Luminex RVP FAST assay. RESULTS: At least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 46% (21% influenza, 25% noninfluenza; 2% coinfection) of the 286 enrolled patients in 2011\u20132012 and in 62% (46% influenza, 16% noninfluenza; 3% coinfection) of the 396 enrolled patients in 2012\u20132013. Among patients aged \u226575 years, twice as many ORVs (32%) as influenza viruses (14%) were detected in 2011\u20132012. During both seasons, the most frequently detected ORVs were enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (7%), respiratory syncytial virus (6%), human metapneumovirus (5%), coronaviruses (4%), and parainfluenza viruses (2%). Disease severity was similar for influenza and ORVs during both seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Although ORV contribution relative to influenza varies by age and season, during the peak weeks of certain influenza seasons, ORVs may be a more frequent cause of elderly hospitalization than influenza.","publish_time":"2014-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilca, Rodica; Amini, Rachid; Douville-Fradet, Monique; Charest, Hugues; Dubuque, Jos\u00E9e; Boulianne, Nicole; Skowronski, Danuta M.; De Serres, Gaston","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f82db8107ec9ced3f686b30ccc27645cd6f9643.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4281811.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25734152/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofu086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex RVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak weeks of certain influenza seasons","respiratory viruses","peak weeks of seasonal influenza epidemics","detected ORVs","respiratory symptoms","respiratory syncytial virus","enrolled patients","severe respiratory infections","specimens","coinfection","noninfluenza","parainfluenza viruses","laboratory confirmation","age","ORV contribution relative","prospective study","clinical data","frequent cause of elderly hospitalization","adults","rhinoviruses","Luminex RVP FAST assay","Disease severity","CONCLUSIONS","enteroviruses","BACKGROUND","hospitals","METHODS","human metapneumovirus","RESULTS","years","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. Conclusion The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis. It will also guide public health guidelines for at-risk populations to reduce risks of complications from such comorbidities.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abootalebi, Shahram; Aertker, Benjamin M.; Andalibi, Mohammad Sobhan; Asdaghi, Negar; Aykac, Ozlem; Azarpazhooh, M.

DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5\u2032 end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred.

Determination of cause of death helps in understanding why and how it occurs, and it is an indispensable aid to parents wanting to understand why their baby died and to determine the recurrence risk and management in subsequent pregnancy. Consequently, a perinatal death requires adequate diagnostic investigation. An important first step in the analysis of PD is to identify the case circumstances, including relevant details regarding maternal history, obstetric history and current pregnancy (complications are evaluated and recorded). In the next step, placental examination is suggested in all cases, together with molecular cytogenetic evaluation and fetal autopsy. Investigation for fetal\u2013maternal hemorrhage by Kleihauer is also recommended as standard. In cases where parents do not consent to autopsy, alternative approaches such as minimally invasive postmortem examination, postmortem magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal photographs are good alternatives. After all investigations have been performed it is important to combine findings from the clinical review and investigations together, to identify the most probable cause of death and counsel the parents regarding their loss.","publish_time":"2017-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nijkamp, J.W.; Sebire, N.J.; Bouman, K.; Korteweg, F.J.; Erwich, J.J.H.M.; Gordijn, S.J.","journal":"Semin Fetal Neonatal Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bef9eb1c377ae09eaaa5213fb68e74e9b6fe37d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118457.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744165X17300203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325580/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2017.02.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1744165X17300203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Perinatal death","parents","fetal autopsy","probable cause of death","obstetric history","maternal history","fetal photographs","cases","step","investigations","invasive postmortem examination","current pregnancy","maternal hemorrhage","subsequent pregnancy","placental examination","analysis of PD","Determination of cause","devastating obstetric complication","postmortem magnetic resonance imaging","adequate diagnostic investigation","relevant details","molecular cytogenetic evaluation","recurrence risk","case circumstances","alternative approaches","management","findings","Kleihauer","complications","clinical review","good alternatives","indispensable aid","baby","loss"],"language":"en"},

During reovirus entry into cells, the outermost capsid layer (composed of proteins \u03C33 and \u03BC1C) is proteolytically processed to generate an infectious subviral particle (ISVP) that is subsequently uncoated to produce the transcriptionally active core particle. Kinetic studies suggest that protein \u03C33 is rapidly removed from virus particles and then protein \u03BC1C is cleaved. Initial cleavage of \u03BC1C has been well described and generates an amino (N)-terminal \u03B4 peptide and a carboxyl (C)-terminal \u03C6 peptide. However, cleavage and removal of \u03C33 is an extremely rapid event that has not been well defined. We have treated purified reovirus serotype 1 Lang virions with a variety of endoproteases. Time-course digestions with chymotrypsin, Glu-C, pepsin, and trypsin resulted in the initial generation of two peptides that were resolved in SDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Most tested proteases cut \u03C33 within a \u201Chypersensitive\u201D region between amino acids 217 and 238. In addition, to gain a better understanding of the sequence of subsequent proteolytic events that result in generation of reovirus subviral particles, time-course digestions of purified particles were performed under physiologic salt conditions and released peptide fragments ranging from 500 to 5000 Da were directly analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Trypsin digestion initially released a peptide that corresponded to the C-terminus of \u03BC1C, followed by a peptide that corresponded to amino acids 214\u2013236 of the \u03C33 protein. Other regions of \u03BC1C were not observed until protein \u03C33 was completely digested. Similar experiments with Glu-C indicated the hypersensitive region of \u03C33 was cut first when virions were treated at pH values of 4.5 or 7.4, but treatment of virions with pepsin at pH 3.0 released different \u03C33 peptides, suggesting acid-induced conformational changes in this outer capsid protein. These studies also revealed that the N-terminus of \u03C33 is acetylated.","publish_time":"2003-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Israel I; She, Yi-Min; Ens, Werner; Coombs, Kevin M","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/750c71cd406455980ce4dbb28a090adbf0ba9243.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202455.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203001545; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203001545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lang"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein \u03C33","\u03C33 protein","proteins \u03C33","removal of \u03C33","protein \u03BC1C","hypersensitive region of \u03C33","different \u03C33 peptides","Glu-C","C-terminus","peptide fragments","outer capsid protein","Initial cleavage of \u03BC1C","regions of \u03BC1C","generation of reovirus subviral particles","terminal \u03B4 peptide","terminal \u03C6 peptide","virus particles","reovirus entry","Abstract Reovirus","amino acids","purified reovirus serotype","time-course digestions of purified particles","Lang virions","pepsin","treatment of virions","initial generation","MALDI-Qq","Trypsin digestion","N-terminus","TOFMS","outermost capsid layer","double-layered capsid","infectious subviral particle","enteric virus","structural proteins","pH values","Kinetic studies","gel tryptic digestion","active core particle","carboxyl","chymotrypsin","physiologic salt conditions","conformational changes","sequence of subsequent proteolytic events","cells","better understanding","ISVP","variety of endoproteases","rapid event","Similar experiments","tested proteases","PAGE","addition","SDS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged \u003E18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests. The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative. The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively. The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P \u003C .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miao, Congliang; Jin, Mengdi; Miao, Li; Yang, Xinying; Huang, Peng; Xiong, Huanwen; Huang, Peijie; Zhao, Qi; Du, Jiang; Hong, Jiang","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c42f476de47da637d86ba9a386c4edad8da06bd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166306.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720302813; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720302813?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive patients","enrolled patients","combined chest CT features","single chest CT features","Adult patients","combinations","chest CT scans","imaging features of COVID","typical CT imaging features","diagnostic value of chest CT","combination of GGOs","suspected COVID","repeat RT-PCR tests","testing positive","chest infectious diseases","positive group","differential diagnosis of COVID","results","pleural distribution","testing negative","high specificity","average specificity","bilateral pulmonary distribution","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","prompt treatment","ground glass opacities","crazy-paving pattern","identification","alerting clinicians","years","basic demographics","days of symptom onset","air bronchogram","low sensitivity","study","end of incubation","lower lungs","METHODS","total","OBJECTIVE","purpose","nonconfirmed groups","consolidation","CONCLUSIONS","lesions"],"language":"en"},

Here for the first time, we delineate the influence of HIV on global lncRNAs expression in monocytic cells lines. Our analysis revealed the expression modulation of nearly 1060 such lncRNAs which are associated with differentially expressed mRNAs in active and latent infection. This suggests a greater role of lncRNAs in regulating transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression during HIV infection. The differentially expressed mRNAs were involved in several different biological pathways where immunological networks were most enriched. Importantly, we discovered that HIV induces expression reversal of more than 150 lncRNAs between its active and latent infection. Also, hundreds of unique lncRNAs were identified in both infection conditions.

However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brady, Shannon C.; Zdraljevic, Stefan; Bisaga, Karol W.; Tanny, Robyn E.; Cook, Daniel E.; Lee, Daehan; Wang, Ye; Andersen, Erik C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b84a8c1d507922585ae1c12f5bf90b3ebd407646.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d29c253b473969c4d92ea9911d3badb9a7ee63f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/565218","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bleomycin-response variation","bleomycin responses","bleomycin resistance","bleomycin dosages","response differences","genetic determinants of bleomycin","CB4856 strains","identification of genetic differences","gene causes variation","wild strain","laboratory strain","N2","potential stress-response function of scb","novel nematode-specific gene","CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions","chromosome V","small genomic region","allele replacements","model organism Caenorhabditis elegans","cross","linkage mapping","treatment outcomes","rare variant present","recombinants","powerful chemotherapeutic drug","isogenic lines","approach","mechanism","individual patients","variety of cancers"],"language":"en"},

The origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus are not known. Here, we characterized U.S. PdCV isolates and determined their virulence in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets. Genome analyses revealed that U.S. PdCV isolates possess unique genetic characteristics and share a close relationship with Hong Kong and South Korean PdCV strains and coronaviruses (CoVs) of Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers. The PdCV-positive intestinal content (Ohio CVM1) and the cell culture-adapted PdCV Michigan (MI) strain were orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and/or conventional piglets. Within 1 to 3 days postinfection, profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were observed. Clinical signs were associated with epithelial necrosis in the gastric pits and small intestine, the latter resulting in severe villous atrophy. Mild interstitial pneumonia was identified in the lungs of PdCV-infected piglets. High levels of viral RNA (8 to 11 log RNA copies/g) were detected in intestinal tissues/luminal contents and feces of infected piglets, whereas moderate RNA levels (2 to 5 log RNA copies/g) were detected in blood, lung, liver, and kidney, indicating multisystemic dissemination of the virus. Polyclonal immune serum against PdCV but not immune serum against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reacted with PdCV-infected small-intestinal epithelial cells, indicating that PdCV is antigenically distinct from PEDV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that PdCV caused severe gastrointestinal diseases in swine.","publish_time":"2015-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Yuanmei; Zhang, Yu; Liang, Xueya; Lou, Fangfei; Oglesbee, Michael; Krakowka, Steven; Li, Jianrong","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1376526470f18216200ecd6c375d9913942fa362.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4453528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759498/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00064-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Indiana","United States","U.S.","Hong Kong","Ohio"],"keyphrases":["PdCV isolates","lungs of PdCV","PdCV-positive intestinal content","PdCV-infected small-intestinal epithelial cells","South Korean PdCV strains","cell culture-adapted PdCV Michigan","conventional piglets","feces of infected piglets","log RNA copies","moderate RNA levels","intestinal tissues","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","virulence","High levels of viral RNA","novel porcine coronavirus","novel porcine deltacoronavirus","PEDV","gnotobiotic","Polyclonal immune serum","epithelial necrosis","Ohio CVM1","small intestine","swine industry","United States","profuse watery diarrhea","severe gastrointestinal diseases","severe villous atrophy","close relationship","CoVs","coronaviruses","Hong Kong","Asian leopard cats","Canada","luminal contents","unique genetic characteristics","significant economic loss","gastric pits","Chinese ferret-badgers","liver","kidney","days postinfection","time","multisystemic dissemination","blood","Clinical signs","origin","Genome analyses","Mild interstitial pneumonia","dehydration","Indiana"],"language":"en"},

Three phages expressing TGEV-M-binding peptides were identified and characterized in more depth. A phage-based immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) capable of differentiating TGEV from other coronaviruses was developed using one phage, phTGEV-M7, as antigen. When the phage-ELISA was compared to conventional antibody-based ELISA for detecting infections, phage-ELISA exhibited greater sensitivity. A chemically synthesized, TGEV-M7 peptide (pepTGEV-M7; HALTPIKYIPPG) was evaluated for antiviral activity. Plaque-reduction assays revealed that pepTGEV-M7 was able to prevent TGEV infection in vitro (p \u003C0.01) following pretreatment of the virus with the peptide. Indirect immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR confirmed the inhibitory effects of the peptide.

In this study we observed that TGEV infection induced apoptosis in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TGEV infection up-regulated FasL, activated FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, leading to activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, TGEV infection down-regulated Bcl-2, up-regulated Bax expression, promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, activated mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways activated downstream effector caspase-3, followed by the cleavage of PARP, resulting in cell apoptosis. Moreover, TGEV infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) pretreated PK-15 cells or cells infected with UV-inactivated TGEV.

The assessment was done by considering the international supply chain, with aspects such as the labor intensity, and the relevant geographical and socioeconomic aspects being taken into account. In addition, multi-regional input-output tables were employed to analyze the ripple effects of productivity losses resulting from workers contracting the disease. The results indicate that more than 10% of the workers involved in the supply chain of all the major industries in the United States (USA), China, Japan, and Germany could be considered at risk of contracting dengue fever by 2030. Moreover, the risk was even higher in India and Brazil, namely, more than 70%. The effect of widespread dengue fever infection could influence industrial activities severely, not only in the regions most at risk (India and Brazil) but also in the other regions (USA, Japan, and Germany). Labor-intensive industries, such as agriculture, fisheries, and the distribution sector are particularly at risk and will have to consider appropriate contingency measures. It is recommended that the downstream side of the supply chain, the industries in the USA, Japan, and Germany, supports the introduction of worker\u2019s health management system against the infectious disease into their business partners.

A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 WT screening center. The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment. It can also increase the number of people tested by 9\u201310 fold. However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths. These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant. A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Sang Il; Lee, Ji Yong","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08ff74c5c6acd4d6f5cf14d5754ce0beca10e9ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301300/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["WT screening center","WT center","easy screening of COVID","number of booths","screening clinics","stage of screening treatment","negative pressure booths","limitations","number of people","number of individuals","pandemic","patients","booth volume","fever","rapid ventilation","patient access","efficient consultation","healthcare personnel","ongoing novel coronavirus disease","advantages","adverse reactions","disinfection","consumption of personal protective equipment","congestion","certified environmental disinfectant","respiratory symptoms","mobile technology","countries","overall concept","local needs","Korea","walk-through","risk of cross","institutions","biosafety cabinet","fold"],"language":"en"},

Marmosets breed well in captivity with good reproductive efficiencies and their sexual maturity is reached within 18months of age allowing for rapid expansion of colonies and early availability of sexually mature animals permitting an earlier assessment of product candidates in the adult. Their relatively small size allows a reduction in material requirements leading to a reduction in development time and cost. Fewer animals are also required due to their ability to be used in both pharmacology and toxicology (nonclinical) studies. These factors, alongside a better understanding of their optimal nutrient and welfare requirements over recent years, facilitate the generation of a more cohesive and robust dataset. With the growth of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, non-human primate use has, by necessity, also increased; nevertheless, there is also a growing public call for minimizing their use.

Aspiration is an important cause of NHAP, but it may not require antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AP infections and review the need for empirical antibiotics with atypical coverage in NHAP. Design A prospective cohort study. Setting Four nursing homes with a total number of 772 residents. Participants Patients were aged \u2265 65 years, hospitalized for NHAP, which was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs, from April 2006 to March 2007. Measurements Demographics, clinical parameters, and investigation results were recorded. Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. Results After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test. None of the patients with AP infection received antibiotics indicated for AP infections. However, AP infections did not result in mortality. No pathogen was isolated in 31.5% of cases. Patients without pathogens isolated were less likely to have purulent sputum and crepitations on chest auscultation, compared with those with pneumonia caused by identified pathogens. Conclusions Atypical pathogens (APs) were not associated with mortality even in cases where the prescribed antibiotics did not cover APs. NHAP may not necessarily be treated with empirical antibiotics covering APs.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Hon Ming; Ip, Margaret; Hui, Elsie; Chan, Paul K.S.; Hui, David S.C.; Woo, Jean","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9caa6b55ebcf43e88c3bf5c40742febf6317f15b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106340.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861012003544; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2012.10.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861012003544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23206723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AP","NHAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["empirical antibiotics","episodes of NHAP","commonest APs","pathogens isolated","empirical use of antibiotics","prescribed antibiotics","clinical characteristics of AP infections","Conclusions Atypical pathogens","important cause of NHAP","Participants Patients","atypical coverage","clinical parameters","clinical feature","mortality","cases","mycobacterial cultures","urine cultures","sputum routine","purulent sputum","chest auscultation","nursing homes","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","investigation results","abnormal chest radiographs","Suspected aspiration pneumonitis","prospective cohort study","nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture","serology","blood","polymerase chain reaction tests","need","crepitations","prevalence","presence of respiratory symptoms","Microbial investigations","total number","lone bacteriuria","urinary antigen test","Legionella pneumophila","international consensus","Measurements Demographics","Abstract Objectives","years","residents","antimicrobial treatment"],"language":"en"},

The PI should take into consideration the ethical principles of research, local/national guidance, the community risk of the pandemic in their locale, staffing strain, and the risk involved to each participant, to ultimately decide on the course of action. While balancing the rights and protection of the human subject, we seldom examine patients\u2019 views and opinions about their scheduled research visit(s). This article discusses the ethical principles of beneficence and autonomy in helping the decision-making process. We discuss ways to weigh-in local and national guidance, staffing strain, and institutional support into the decision-making process and outline potential changes needed for regulatory bodies depending on the decision. Further, we discuss the need to weigh-in the individual risk-benefit ratio for each participant and present a decision tree to navigate this complex process. Finally, we examine participant and caregiver perspectives on their fears, sense of preparedness, and factors that they consider before deciding whether to keep or postpone the research appointments.

Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is still challenging even if interferon- (IFN-) free regimens with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV-infected individuals are available in clinical practice. IFNL4 is a newly described protein, associated with human antiviral defenses. We investigated whether IFNL4 ss469415590 variant has an effect on the prediction of treatment response in HCV-infected patients treated with IFN-including regimens. Patients and Methods. In all, 185 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 treated with peg-IFN plus ribavirin, with or without telaprevir, were genotyped for IFNL4 ss469415590. We retrospectively investigated whether the role of IFNL4 ss469415590 variant and other factors could predict sustained virological response (SVR) in Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Results. There were 65.7%, 31.5%, and 2.8% patients in the IFNL4 ss469415590 TT/TT, TT/-G, and -G/-G groups, respectively. SVR rates were 82.1% or 49.3% in patients treated with peg-IFN plus ribavirin with or without telaprevir, respectively.

DESIGN: Prospective study of human leiomyoma cells obtained from myomectomy or hysterectomy. SETTING: University research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Women (n=38) aged 27\u201353 years undergoing surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Adenoviral ICAT overexpression or treatment with varying concentrations of niclosamide or XAV939. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cell proliferation, cell death, WNT/\u03B2-catenin target gene expression or reporter gene regulation, \u03B2-catenin levels and cellular localization. RESULT(S): ICAT, niclosamide, or XAV939 inhibit WNT/\u03B2-catenin pathway activation and exert anti-proliferative effects in primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells. CONCLUSION(S): Three WNT/\u03B2-catenin pathway inhibitors specifically block human leiomyoma growth and proliferation, suggesting that the canonical WNT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of uterine leiomyoma.

Thereby, HCoVs are included in the panel of respiratory viruses detected in routine using molecular biology tools. These four circulating HCoVs have to be distinguished from the two emerging HCoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These later are associated to a more severe respiratory infection and differ from other HCoVs by their increased epidemic potential, their more important health impact, and their atypical circulation.

Data were recorded for 1 year post transplant. Associations between RVI and continuous and categorical risk factors were assessed using Wilcoxon\u0027s rank\u2010sum and \u03C7(2) tests, respectively. Associations between time to RVI and risk factors or survival were assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of 576 subjects, 79 subjects (14%) had 101 RVI in the first year post transplant. Subjects with RVI were younger than those without RVI (median ages 9.7, 13; P\u003C0.01). Viruses detected included adenovirus (n=25), influenza (n=9), respiratory syncytial virus (n=21), parainfluenza virus (n=19), enterovirus (n=4), and rhinovirus (n=22). In a multivariable model for time to first RVI, etiology other than cystic fibrosis (CF), younger age, and no induction therapy were independently associated with risk of RVI.

Previously, we showed that the cellular factor TNF-\u03B1 converting enzyme (TACE), activated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S protein), was positively involved in viral entry, implying that TACE is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds. To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-\u03B1 production in lung tissues. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-S protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations, our data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haga, Shiori; Nagata, Noriyo; Okamura, Tadashi; Yamamoto, Norio; Sata, Tetsutaro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Sasazuki, Takehiko; Ishizaka, Yukihito","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47a9f294822514b5a4ebfea8f18cdfcd326f2f48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114272.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.12.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209005403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995578/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209005403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious SARS-CoV","spike protein of SARS","receptor of SARS","TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection","SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin","TACE inhibitor TAPI","viral entry","effects of TACE inhibitors","severe clinical manifestations","data","enzyme","attenuated entry","severe clinical outcome","antiviral compounds","TNF-\u03B1 production","cellular factor TNF-\u03B1","downregulation of ACE2","outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lentiviral vector backbone","etiological event","pseudotyped virus","lung tissues","possible target","key importance","possibility"],"language":"en"},

A major implication of these findings is that the nature of operational resilience and the disruption circumstances under which it is deployed shape its efficiency value, thus advancing knowledge on the nuances associated with how and when operational resilience influences operational efficiency.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Essuman, Dominic; Boso, Nathaniel; Annan, Jonathan","journal":"Int J Prod Econ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/753ec25054aa9d3d710c30f1c7646e6fdc028e6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152893.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527320301456; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925527320301456; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["operational resilience influences operational efficiency","varying operational disruption conditions","conditions of high operational disruption","differing conditions of operational disruption","conditions of low operational disruption","nature of operational resilience","notion of operational resilience","disruption circumstances","effect of disruption absorption","efficiency value","effect of recoverability","positive effects","unique effects","relationship","firms","analytical tool","deployed shape","primary data","sample","structural equation modeling","findings","sub-Saharan African economy","distinct components","multi-dimensional construct","knowledge","research","study\u0027s hypotheses","major implication","nuances"],"language":"en"},

The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of \u03B2-actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles. This study reveals an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus.","publish_time":"2009-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jibin; Fang, Shouguo; Xiao, Han; Chen, Bo; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7379b8c28321b7f9c78d2b4d35109a87b35cf883.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2653722.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19287488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virion assembly","release of virus particles","Disruption of actin filaments","budding","replication cycle of coronavirus","essential function of actin","detection of viral protein synthesis","infection cycle","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","essential component of virion","viral RNA replication","A159-K160 mutation","infectious IBV clone system","viral envelope","study","interaction","mutation of amino acids A159","mammalian cells","infected cells","early stages","short amino-terminal ectodomain","late stages","cultured media","maturation processes","large carboxy-terminal endodomain","cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D","infectivity","pivotal roles","coimmunoprecipitation","transmembrane domains","subgenomic mRNA transcription","immunofluorescence microscopy","hybrid screen","co-purification","yeast","bait","treatment","identification of \u03B2","Introduction","cellular factors","partner"],"language":"en"},

Via a critical approach grounded in rhetorical theory, I identified three distinct rhetorical motifs influencing the reportage of health information in the early days of the H1N1 outbreak. A public-health motif was exhibited in texts featuring a particular health official and offering the statements of such an official as a mechanism of reassurance. A concealment-of-information motif was exhibited in texts emphasizing the importance of the transparency of health officials, and in texts demonstrating ambivalence about information provided by socially-sanctioned sources. Finally, in texts mythologizing the outbreak to the exclusion of other functions of the text (e.g., conveying who is at risk, protective behaviours, symptoms), I identified a pandemic motif. Each motif differs in the conclusions it offers to audiences seeking to gauge relative levels of risk, and to receive information about protective behaviours. I suggest that one means of interpreting the manifestation of distinct rhetorical motifs in the context of a high-risk health threat is the certainty that this context alters moral responsibilities, consequently influencing the manifestation of narrative role.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laidlaw, Tess","journal":"Minerva","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c18492a189419063bfe9eb5de005eef76b3cab6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214464/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-019-09383-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["information motif","texts","reportage of health information","public-health motif","manifestation of distinct rhetorical motifs","identifiable rhetorical motifs","outbreak context manifest","particular health official","rhetorical theory","pandemic motif","high-risk health threat","transparency of health officials","delivery of biomedical information","H1N1 outbreak","protective behaviours","relative levels of risk","manifestation of narrative role","certainty","turn","journalists\u2019 discursive actions","early days","symptoms","moral responsibilities","exclusion","media","importance","statements","audiences","paper","functions","critical approach","ambivalence","mechanism of reassurance","conclusions","sanctioned sources","concealment"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the equilibrium between innate and adaptive protective responses and immune pathology might contribute to the development of strategies against ASFV. Here we compare, using a proteomic approach, the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous strains: the virulent E75 and the attenuated E75CV1. Our results show a progressive loss of proteins by day 7 post-infection (pi) with E75, reflecting tissue destruction. Many signal pathways were affected by both infections but in different ways and extensions. Cytoskeletal remodelling and clathrin-endocytosis were affected by both isolates, while a greater number of proteins involved on inflammatory and immunological pathways were altered by E75CV1. 14-3-3 mediated signalling, related to immunity and apoptosis, was inhibited by both isolates. The implication of the Rho GTPases by E75CV1 throughout infection is also evident. Early events reflected the lack of E75 recognition by the immune system, an evasion strategy acquired by the virulent strains, and significant changes at 7 days post-infection (dpi), coinciding with the peak of infection and the time of death. The protein signature at day 31 pi with E75CV1 seems to reflect events observed at 1 dpi, including the upregulation of proteosomal subunits and molecules described as autoantigens (vimentin, HSPB1, enolase and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1), which allow the speculation that auto-antibodies could contribute to chronic ASFV infections. Therefore, the use of proteomics could help understand ASFV pathogenesis and immune protection, opening new avenues for future research.

Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or \u2018synanthropic\u2019 species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.","publish_time":"2012-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFarlane, Ro; Sleigh, Adrian; McMichael, Tony","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9211cfbf3e5afa35a25c841adc2e65eed47dd07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088064.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22526750/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-012-0763-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species able","EIDs of wildlife origin","synanthropic wildlife hosts","wildlife species of low conservation risk","wildlife host information","global wildlife conservation data","source of emerging infectious diseases","hosts of zoonotic emerging","emerging infectious disease literature","East Asian regions","global decline","significant positive association","human-modified environments","human-induced landscape change","findings","mechanism","land conversion","biodiversity","Australasian","rise","expense","times","special emphasis","habitat loss","simplified landscapes","relationship","taxonomy","Humans","evidence","increase","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis of 78 NeVs RdRp fragments showed that 69 strains were closely related to NB-like strains, and the remaining 9 strains were clustered into an independent branch, which may represent a novel RdRp genotype. Two complete NeVs genomes (YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH) were successfully sequenced with 7459 nt and 7460 nt in length, respectively. The genomes of the two strains only shared 68.1%\u201369.3% nt identity with all six known NeVs genomes, and phylogenetic trees based on its genome, VP1, RdRp, VP2, P34, NTPase, P30, VPg and 3CLpro proteins suggested that the two strains may represent a novel NeVs strain with novel VP1 genotype and novel RdRp genotype. Notably, 11.5% NeVs strains were screened as the novel NeVs strains based VP1 and RdRp sequences. These novel NeVs strains were detected from 6 farms in two counties, indicating that the novel NeVs has spread in local region. To best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of NeVs in yak. Moreover, a novel NeVs strain was identified based on complete genome. These results contribute to further understand the prevalence and genetic evolution of NeVs.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Zijing; He, Qifu; Zhang, Bin; Yue, Hua; Tang, Cheng","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64910e72cdeca0bc91eb53df91d0a5a48a0da5d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127790.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519307412; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108388; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519307412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["novel NeVs strains","NeVs-positive","detection of NeVs","NeVs RdRp fragments","complete NeVs genomes","known NeVs genomes","novel RdRp genotype","genetic evolution of NeVs","novel VP1 genotype","yak","RdRp sequences","farms","complete genome","nt identity","diarrhoeic samples","phylogenetic trees","Phylogenetic analysis","P30","P34","VP2","NRG","VPg","NTPase","important causative agent of calf diarrhea","Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","CLpro proteins","prevalence","PCR assay","China","HY1","local region","counties","Abstract Neboviruses","independent branch","knowledge","length","NB","best","results"],"language":"en"},

Up-regulation of ND4 level by VV infection was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. Up-regulation of ND4 was reduced by the MAPK inhibitor, apigenin, which has been demonstrated elsewhere to inhibit VV replication. The induction of ND4 expression occurred after viral DNA replication since ara C, an inhibitor of poxviral DNA replication, could block this induction. ATP production was increased in the host cells after VV infection. Moreover, 4.5 \u03BCM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP production, reduced the ATP level 13 hr after virus infection to that of mock-infected cells and inhibited viral protein expression and virus production, suggesting that increased ATP production is required for efficient VV production.

There remains a need to provide rapid and comprehensive assessment to acute stroke patients while reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure, protecting healthcare providers, and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. While the COVID infection is typically not a primary cerebrovascular condition, the downstream effects of this pandemic force adjustments to stroke care pathways to maintain optimal stroke patient outcomes. Methods The University of California San Diego (UCSD) Health System encompasses two academic, Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs). The UCSD Stroke Center reviewed the national COVID-19 crisis and implications on stroke care. All current resources for stroke care were identified and adapted to include COVID-19 screening. The adjusted model focused on comprehensive and rapid acute stroke treatment, reduction of exposure to the healthcare team, and preservation of PPE. Aims The adjusted pathways implement telestroke assessments as a specific option for all inpatient and outpatient encounters and accounts for when telemedicine systems are not available or functional. COVID screening is done on all stroke patients. We outline a model of hyperacute stroke evaluation in an adapted stroke code protocol and novel methods of stroke patient management. Conclusions The overall goal of the model is to preserve patient access and outcomes while decreasing potential COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare providers. This model also serves to reduce the use of vital PPE. It is critical that stroke providers share best practices via academic and vetted social media platforms for rapid dissemination of tools and care models during the COVID-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Dawn; Meyer, Brett C.; Rapp, Karen S.; Modir, Royya; Agrawal, Kunal; Hailey, Lovella; Mortin, Melissa; Lane, Richard; Ranasinghe, Tamra; Sorace, Brian; von Kleist, Tara D.; Perrinez, Emily; Nabulsi, Mohammed; Hemmen, Thomas","journal":"J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f5870b66e190afa3f7876fa16b2bef39c35171d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434728/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720303335?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720303335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104927","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Comprehensive Stroke Centers","UCSD Stroke Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stroke providers","stroke care pathways","stroke code pathways","acute stroke patients","Comprehensive Stroke Centers","UCSD Stroke Center","hospital stroke management","adaptation of hyperacute stroke care","model of hyperacute stroke evaluation","rapid acute stroke treatment","optimal stroke patient outcomes","adapted stroke code protocol","COVID screening","novel methods of stroke patient management","national COVID","potential COVID","risk of COVID","COVID infection","care models","healthcare providers","adjusted model","adjusted pathways","comprehensive assessment","reduction of exposure","patient access","healthcare team","crisis","preservation of PPE","rapid dissemination of tools","use of vital PPE","pandemic force adjustments","vetted social media platforms","best practices","downstream effects","Health System","University of California San Diego","outpatient encounters","specific option","telemedicine systems","personal protective equipment","accounts","primary cerebrovascular condition","telestroke assessments","implications","supplies","CSCs","Conclusions","overall goal","need","current resources","Abstract Background"],"language":"en"},

Tools that facilitate the in silico prediction of immune response to biothreats, emerging infectious diseases, and cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next generation vaccines and their delivery to the clinic. Over the past 20 years, vaccinologists, bioinformatics experts, and advanced programmers based in Providence, Rhode Island, USA have advanced the development of an integrated toolkit for vaccine design called iVAX, that is secure and user-accessible by internet. This integrated set of immunoinformatic tools comprises algorithms for scoring and triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic and conserved T cell epitopes, re-engineering or eliminating regulatory T cell epitopes, and re-designing antigens to induce immunogenicity and protection against disease for humans and livestock. Commercial and academic applications of iVAX have included identifying immunogenic T cell epitopes in the development of a T-cell based human multi-epitope Q fever vaccine, designing novel influenza vaccines, identifying cross-conserved T cell epitopes for a malaria vaccine, and analyzing immune responses in clinical vaccine studies.

Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits.

It is important to monitor antimicrobial use to better understand trends and patterns in antimicrobial resistance. There is no monitoring of antimicrobial use in companion animals in Canada. To explore how the use of electronic medical records could contribute to the ongoing, systematic collection of antimicrobial use data in companion animals, anonymized electronic medical records were extracted from 12 participating companion animal practices and warehoused at the University of Calgary. We used the pre-diagnostic, clinical features of diarrhea as the case definition in this study. Using text-mining technologies, cases of diarrhea were described by each of the following variables: diagnostic laboratory tests performed, the etiological diagnosis and antimicrobial therapies. The ability of the text miner to accurately describe the cases for each of the variables was evaluated. It could not reliably classify cases in terms of diagnostic tests or etiological diagnosis; a manual review of a random sample of 500 diarrhea cases determined that 88/500 (17.6%) of the target cases underwent diagnostic testing of which 36/88 (40.9%) had an etiological diagnosis. Text mining, compared to a human reviewer, could accurately identify cases that had been treated with antimicrobials with high sensitivity (92%, 95% confidence interval, 88.1%\u201395.4%) and specificity (85%, 95% confidence interval, 80.2%\u201389.1%). Overall, 7400/15,928 (46.5%) of pets presenting with diarrhea were treated with antimicrobials. Some temporal trends and patterns of the antimicrobial use are described.

We obtain several threshold parameters from local analysis of various equilibria of the proposed system as well as coupled conditions on these threshold parameters which determine the stability of these equilibria. One of the coupled conditions, in the form of an ecological threshold number for the predator\u2013prey ecosystem, always determines the coexistence of predators and prey. The other condition, in the form of a disease basic reproduction number, dictates whether the disease will become endemic in the ecosystem. Under one combination of these coupled conditions, a highly infectious disease could drive the predators to extinction when predators and prey would have coexisted without the disease. For another combination of the conditions, the predation of the more vulnerable infected prey could cause the disease to be eradicated in the ecosystem, in some case even approaching a disease-free periodic solution, when the disease would have otherwise remained endemic in the prey population in the absence of predation. This indicates that the presence of disease in both predators and prey could either promote or impair coexistence, and its precise impact needs to be explored specifically in each particular situation. By considering disease infection in both populations, our model also yields more complex dynamics, allowing for the possibility of bistability and periodic oscillation, in either disease-free or endemic states, in the ecosystem for which the conditions are obtained analytically and with the help of numerical simulations.","publish_time":"2008-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Hsiao, Chin-Kuei","journal":"Math Med Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d18a5744e2b4fe8db62caa1565f87491f2e6fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqn017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18701422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease infection","prey ecosystem","infectious disease","presence of disease","prey model","prey population","coupled conditions","disease basic reproduction number","vulnerable infected prey","coexistence of predators","contagious disease crossing species barrier","threshold parameters","form","ecological threshold number","endemic states","populations","combination","disease-free periodic solution","periodic oscillation","possibility of bistability","proposed system","absence of predation","local analysis of various equilibria","case","extinction","precise impact needs","complex dynamics","help of numerical simulations","particular situation"],"language":"en"},

This study assesses the long-term efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine (VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP) in two rodent models of EBOV infection. Mice and guinea pigs were first immunized with 2\u00D7104 or 2\u00D7105 plaque forming units (PFU) of VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP, respectively. Challenge of mice with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination provided complete protection, and 80% (12 of 15 survivors) protection at 12 months after vaccination. Challenge of guinea pigs with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GA-EBOV) at 7, 12 and 18 months after vaccination resulted in 83% (5 of 6 survivors) at 7 months after vaccination, and 100% survival at 12 and 18 months after vaccination. No weight loss or clinical signs were observed in the surviving animals. Antibody responses were analyzed using sera from individual rodents. Levels of EBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG antibody measured immediately before challenge appeared to correlate with protection.

Respiratory virus-induced wheezing illnesses in early life are a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma, and virus infections may also play a role in the development and progression of airway remodeling in asthma. It is clear that upper respiratory tract virus infections can spread to the lower airway and trigger acute attacks of asthma, COPD or CF. These exacerbations can be life-threatening, and exert an enormous burden on health care systems. In recent years we have gained new insights into the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses may induce acute exacerbations of lower airway diseases, as well as into host defense pathways that may regulate the outcomes to viral infections. In the current article we review the role of viruses in lower airway diseases, including our current understanding on pathways by which they may cause remodeling and trigger acute exacerbations. We also review the efficacy of current and emerging therapies used to treat these lower airway diseases on the outcomes due to viral infection, and discuss alternative therapeutic approaches for the management of virus-induced airway inflammation.","publish_time":"2014-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leigh, Richard; Proud, David","journal":"Pharmacol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/898adc22b8d5710146cd8b103497b8a8d7b68a7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173263.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725814002344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25550230/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725814002344; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.12.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute exacerbations of lower airway diseases","common respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract virus infections","lower airways","Uncomplicated upper respiratory viral infections","progression of airway remodeling","induced airway inflammation","acute attacks of asthma","management of virus","role of viruses","subsequent development of asthma","chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases","COPD","outcomes","current understanding","efficacy of current","current article","common cause of days","major economic burden","enormous burden","major impact","host defense pathways","significant risk factor","early life","wheezing illnesses","alternative therapeutic approaches","school","work","new insights","cystic fibrosis","emerging therapies","human rhinoviruses","health care systems","mechanisms","susceptible individuals","recent years","CF"],"language":"en"},

Subsequently, it was re-designated as D/132, and formed a new serogroup among rotaviruses, the group D rotavirus (RVD). Since their identification, RVs are the leading cause of enteritis and diarrhea in humans and various animal species, and are also associated with abridged growth, particularly in avian species. Recently, RVD has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of runting and stunting syndrome (RSS), alongside other viruses such as reovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and others, all of which cause colossal economic losses to the poultry industry. RVD has been reported from several countries worldwide, and to date, only one complete genome sequence for RVD is available.

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as \u201CRemdesivir\u201D or \u2018GS-5734\u2033 AND \u201CCOVID-19\u201D or \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Akriti; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1f67bc0ea257e3e188942b8d3557d6aa167898d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428865/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301375; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301375?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","MedRxiv"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","clinical effects of remdesivir","clinical outcomes of remdesivir","Initial compassionate use of remdesivir","mixed result","patients","SARS-CoV","preliminary result","good result","randomized trial","pharmacology","RESULTS","absence of control arm","significant benefit","Newer randomized controlled studies","significant faster time","similar multi-country trial","broad spectrum anti-viral drug","recovery","PubMed","ClinicalTrial","Org","MedRxiv database","AIMS","effective treatment","specific key words","difference","placebo","Wuhan","infection","English language","article","mortality","forthcoming trials","literature","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","GS","METHODS","jury"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A questionnaire was addressed to parents for the collection of sociodemographic and medical information. Nasopharyngeal swabbing was processed using a molecular method. We used logistic regression models to examine independent associations between pneumococcal carriage and potential risk factors. All associations with a p-value of \u003C 0.25 in the bivariate regression analyses were subsequently entered in the multivariate regression model. RESULTS: A total of 637 children aged 1 to 59 months admitted for acute respiratory infection were included. The rate of respiratory virus carriage was 76%, whereas that of bacteria was 47% and that of bacteria-virus co-colonization was 42%. A bivariate analysis showed that carriage was not related to gender, father\u0027s or mother\u0027s education level, father\u0027s occupation, type of housing or lighting, or passive exposure to cigarette smoking in the house. It was also not linked to complete vaccination with PCV-13 or PPSV-23 and antibiotic treatment prior to hospitalization. A multivariate analysis showed that carriage was related to age greater than 3 months, maternal occupation, house flooring type, and co-colonization of another bacterium and virus. CONCLUSION: These results can be helpful to understand the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization; they confirm the interest of vaccinating infants before the age of 3 months with appropriate vaccine to prevent spread nasopharyngeal colonization and pneumococcal diseases in children.","publish_time":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dano, Ibrahim Dan; Ousmane, Sani; Moumouni, Kamaye; Lagare, Adamou; Issa, Idi; Testa, Jean","journal":"Pan Afr Med J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6814941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2019.33.239.15945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal carriage","months","spread nasopharyngeal colonization","dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization","children","rate of respiratory virus carriage","bacteria-virus co-colonization","pneumococcal diseases","father\u0027s occupation","Nasopharyngeal swabbing","bivariate regression analyses","multivariate regression model","multivariate analysis","bivariate analysis","RESULTS","house flooring type","logistic regression models","maternal occupation","type of housing","independent associations","Streptococcus pneumonia","age greater","acute respiratory infection","leading cause of bacterial pneumonia","important source of horizontal spread","mother\u0027s education level","lighting","meningitis","sepsis","appropriate vaccine","passive exposure","gender","potential risk factors","cigarette smoking","PPSV","collection of sociodemographic","pathogens","PCV","antibiotic treatment","parents","medical information","INTRODUCTION","bacterium","complete vaccination","molecular method","p-value","vaccinating infants","questionnaire","hospitalization","CONCLUSION","community","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Consecutive adults (\u003E18 years old) who attended for pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination were eligible to complete an anonymous questionnaire with closed answers to evaluate their level of knowledge about MERS-CoV. To evaluate the effectiveness of the information given during the consultation, the same questionnaire was completed by the Hajj pilgrim before and after the consultation, where the information about MERS-CoV was provided. Results Among 82 Hajj pilgrim adults enrolled in the study, less than 25% were aware of the routes of transmission, symptoms and preventive behaviours to adopt abroad or in case of fever. Pilgrims had a higher rate of correct responses on each question at the time they completed the second questionnaire, as compared with the first, with 11 of 13 questions answered significantly better after delivery of educational information about MERS-CoV. However, although the rate of correct answers to the questions about routes of transmission, symptoms, preventive behaviours to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential MERS-CoV occurrence increased significantly after receiving the information, the rates remained below 50%. Conclusion Information given during travel consultations significantly increases the general level of knowledge, but not enough to achieve epidemic control.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Migault, C.; Kanagaratnam, L.; Hentzien, M.; Giltat, A.; Nguyen, Y.; Brunet, A.; Thibault, M.; Legall, A.; Drame, M.; Bani-Sadr, F.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaa0dcb4ac1fa33484589cc17fedde949e2ec8b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118754.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2019.05.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350619301647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252151/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350619301647","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reims University Hospital","Conclusion Information"],"locations":["Middle East","France"],"keyphrases":["potential MERS-CoV occurrence","Hajj pilgrims","Conclusion Information","Hajj pilgrim adults","general level of knowledge","delivery of educational information","international vaccination","travel consultations","routes of transmission","pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination","preventive behaviours","symptoms","rate of correct answers","questions","anonymous questionnaire","case of fever","cross-sectional study","international vaccine consultations","travel medicine","time delay","higher rate of correct responses","closed answers","Methods Consecutive adults","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","return","education health programme","years old","Reims University Hospital","France","Results","Abstract Objective","epidemic control","effectiveness","rates"],"language":"en"},

Total negative pressure isolation using portable bioisolation tents may provide a solution. The study assesses the ability of health care workers to perform emergency procedures in this environment. Methods Physician performance in completing predetermined critical actions in 5 emergency care scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent (\u201Csetting\u201D) was studied in an advanced medical simulation laboratory. By design, no pretraining of subjects about total negative pressure isolation use occurred. Impact of setting on time to completion of predetermined critical actions was the primary outcome measured. Secondary variables studied included impact of study groups, scenarios, and run order (inside or outside of the tent first). Subjective assessments were obtained through questionnaires. Results Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 emergency patient care scenarios during 2 4-hour sessions. Mean time to completion of critical actions was for tent/no tent 298 seconds/284 seconds (P=.69, one way ANOVA), respectively. Mean time to completion for first versus second performance of a scenario in the crossover design was 338 versus 243 (P=.01). The mean score for self-assessed performance did not differ according to setting.

Additionally, several serological assays have been developed and are currently used for the detection of antibodies against PEDV. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) became the methods of choice for the diagnosis of PEDV infection, providing sensitive, specific and rapid detection of the virus RNA in clinical samples.

Is there an \u2018infectious march\u2019 triggered by infection in infancy that progresses to disease pathology or are infants who contract respiratory infections predisposed to developing asthma?

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were: a) to evaluate whether the nasal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) are able to improve respiratory antiviral defenses and beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by TLR3/RIG-I activation; b) to investigate whether viability of Lr05 or Lr06 is indispensable to modulate respiratory immunity and; c) to evaluate the capacity of Lr05 and Lr06 to improve the resistance of infant mice against RSV infection. RESULTS: Nasally administered Lr05 and Lr06 differentially modulated the TLR3/RIG-I-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response. Lr06 administration significantly modulated the production of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2 and IL-6 in the response to poly(I:C) challenge, while nasal priming with Lr05 was more effective to improve levels of IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10. Both viable Lr05 and Lr06 strains increased the resistance of infant mice to RSV infection while only heat-killed Lr05 showed a protective effect similar to those observed with viable strains. CONCLUSIONS: The present work demonstrated that nasal administration of immunobiotics is able to beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by TLR3/RIG-I activation in the respiratory tract and to increase the resistance of mice to the challenge with RSV. Comparative studies using two Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of the same origin and with similar technological properties showed that each strain has an specific immunoregulatory effect in the respiratory tract and that they differentially modulate the immune response after poly(I:C) or RSV challenges, conferring different degree of protection and using distinct immune mechanisms. We also demonstrated in this work that it is possible to beneficially modulate the respiratory defenses against RSV by using heat-killed immunobiotics.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomosada, Yohsuke; Chiba, Eriko; Zelaya, Hortensia; Takahashi, Takuya; Tsukida, Kohichiro; Kitazawa, Haruki; Alvarez, Susana; Villena, Julio","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe7169e14eea9af001ae388632123d43eeb9697.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3751766.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-14-40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23947615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasally"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","antiviral respiratory immune response","respiratory defenses","Lr06 strains","Lr06 administration","respiratory tract","administered Lr05","viable Lr05","capacity of Lr05","viability of Lr05","respiratory immunity","respiratory antiviral defenses","RSV challenges","respiratory syncytial virus","nasal administration of immunobiotics","resistance of mice","TLR3","administered immunobiotics","capacity of immunobiotics","resistance of infant mice","Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains","viable strains","nasal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505","distinct immune mechanisms","levels of IFN","production of IFN","nasal priming","rhamnosus CRL1506","IFN-\u03B2","heat","outcome of influenza virus infection","activation","poly","protective effect similar","Comparative studies","present work","different degree of protection","specific immunoregulatory effect","similar technological properties","origin","potential","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","aims","study","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Lu; Van Dung, Nguyen; Ivens, Alasdair; Bogaardt, Carlijn; O\u2019Toole, Aine; Bryant, Juliet E; Carrique-Mas, Juan; Van Cuong, Nguyen; Anh, Pham Hong; Rabaa, Maia A; Tue, Ngo Tri; Thwaites, Guy E; Baker, Stephen; Simmonds, Peter; Woolhouse, Mark Ej","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bbd4c83266579a2afbe995cf64f3200d4d4cb7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5810437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449965/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Vietnam","Southern Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["cross-species transmission of kobuviruses","evolution of kobuviruses","human kobuviruses","described bat kobuviruses","novel bat kobuviruses","mammalian species","evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses","multiple cross-species transmissions","animal species","Cross-species transmission of viruses","understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity","rodents","different host orders","different hosts","bat roosts","humans","various mammalian hosts","Southern Vietnam","phylogenetic analyses","Bayesian phylogenetic methods","sentinel cohort","bats","possibility","sustained threat","generation sequencing","genome kobuvirus sequences","pigs","complexity","new knowledge of rodent","ensuing disease outbreaks","conventional PCR amplification","cats","time of origin","public health","increased contact","data","evolutionary history","civets"],"language":"en"},

However, alcohol alone lacks the required antimicrobial persistence to provide for the sustained periods of skin antisepsis desired in the clinical environment. Therefore, alcohol-based products must have a preservative agent such as iodine/iodophor compounds, chlorhexidine gluconate, or zinc pyrithione, to extend its antimicrobial effects. Iodine, iodophors, and chlorhexidine gluconate are well-characterized antimicrobials and preservatives. The thrust of our effort was to examine the characteristics of the lesser-known zinc pyrithione and to evaluate its utility as a preservative in the formulation of alcohol-based products for skin antisepsis. This work includes a literature review of current zinc pyrithione applications in drugs and cosmetics, a safety and toxicity evaluation, consideration of the proposed mechanisms of antimicrobial action, in vitro and in vivo efficacy data, and a discussion of the mechanisms that confer the desired antimicrobial persistence. In addition, alcohol-based, zinc pyrithione-preserved, commercially available products of skin antisepsis are compared with other commercially available antimicrobials used for skin antisepsis and with additional alcohol-based products with different preservatives. The authors\u0027 conclusion is that zinc pyrithione is not only a safe and effective antimicrobial but that its use in certain alcohol-based formulations results in antimicrobial efficacy exceeding that of iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guthery, Eugene; Seal, Lawton A.; Anderson, Edward L.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04149423c28c433b880403b06601499e6f63d2da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119132.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665530400570X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665530400570X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["additional alcohol-based products","antimicrobial efficacy","available products of skin antisepsis","formulation of alcohol","certain alcohol-based formulations","antimicrobial effects","desired antimicrobial persistence","chlorhexidine gluconate","sustained periods of skin antisepsis","iodine","required antimicrobial persistence","proposed mechanisms of antimicrobial action","literature review of current zinc pyrithione applications","efficacy data","available antimicrobials","preservative agent","different preservatives","long history of safety","well-characterized antimicrobials","cosmetics","consideration","drugs","iodophor compounds","use","toxicity evaluation","iodophors","utility","work","characteristics","discussion","United States","authors\u0027 conclusion","clinical environment","effort","thrust"],"language":"en"},

However, as one of the most common respiratory viruses circulated worldwide, the epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics of human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in these cases were not well known. OBJECTIVES: To reveal the epidemiological features of HPIV infection in SARIs in Beijing area from September 2014 to August 2016. METHODS: A total of 1229 SARI cases in Beijing area were enrolled, investigated, sampled, and tested by multiplex real\u2010time PCR to identify HPIVs and other common respiratory viruses. Eighteen HPIV\u20103 viruses isolated from all HPIV\u2010positive samples in these SARI cases were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Among all enrolled cases, 0.81%, 0.73%, 4.48%, and 0.57% were positive for HPIV\u20101 to HPIV\u20104, respectively. The highest yield rate of HPIV infection occurred in children under 5 years old (9.07%), followed by the patients over 60 years old (6.02%). The phylogenetic information of HPIV\u20103 showed that all viruses belonged to Cluster C3a. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the young children, the elders older than 60 years also showed a relatively high infection rate of HPIVs, which should be given comparable attentions. Moreover, the HPIV\u20103 circulating in China undergoes continued evolution, suggesting the potential risk of evolved HPIV infection should not be overlooked.","publish_time":"2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yang; Zhang, Yi; Shi, Weixian; Peng, Xiaomin; Cui, Shujuan; Zhang, Daitao; Lu, Guilan; Liu, Yimeng; Wu, Shuangsheng; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3bef1c075c76c313a27542f3aa138c48b1c5d3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5705688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29054112/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["epidemiological features of HPIV infection","phylogenetic information of HPIV","highest yield rate of HPIV infection","potential risk of evolved HPIV infection","SARI cases","common respiratory viruses","enrolled cases","Severe acute respiratory infection","high infection rate of HPIVs","years old","Beijing area","human health","young children","positive samples","phylogenetic characteristics of human parainfluenza virus","huge number of hospitalized patients","SARIs","continued evolution","survival","elders older","BACKGROUND","total","China","real\u2010time PCR","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","METHODS","Cluster C3a","RESULTS","comparable attentions"],"language":"en"},

Thus, new simple and fast theoretical models are required. One option is the complex network graphs theory that permits us to describe any real system, from the small molecules to the complex genetic, neural or social networks by transforming real properties in topological indices. This work converts the protein primary structure data in specific Randic\u0027s star networks topological indices using the new sequence to star networks (S2SNet) application. A set of 1054 proteins were selected from previous works and contains proteins related or not with two types of cancer, human breast cancer (HBC) and human colon cancer (HCC). The general discriminant analysis method generates an input-coded multi-target classification model with the training/predicting set accuracies of 90.0% for the forward stepwise model type. In addition, a protein subset was modified by single amino acid mutations with higher log-odds PAM250 values and tested with the new classification if can be related with HBC or HCC. In conclusion, we shown that, using simple input data such is the primary protein sequence and the simples linear analysis, it is possible to obtain accurate classification models that can predict if a new protein related with two types of cancer.

The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited.

Culture techniques, predominantly used for bioaerosol characterisation in the past, allow for the recovery of only a small fraction of the real airborne microbial burden in indoor settings, given the inability of several microorganisms to grow on agar plates. However, with the development of new tools to detect non-culturable environmental microorganisms, the study of bioaerosols has advanced significantly. Most importantly, these techniques have revealed a more complex bioaerosol burden that also includes non-culturable microorganisms, such as archaea and viruses. Nevertheless, air quality specialists and consultants remain reluctant to adopt these new research-developed techniques, given that there are relatively few studies found in the literature, making it difficult to find a point of comparison. Furthermore, it is unclear as to how this new non-culturable data can be used to assess the impact of bioaerosol exposure on human health. This article reviews the literature that describes the non-culturable fraction of bioaerosols, focussing on bacteria, archaea and viruses, and examines its impact on bioaerosol-related diseases. It also outlines available molecular tools for the detection and quantification of these microorganisms and states various research needs in this field.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blais-Lecours, Pascale; Perrott, Phillipa; Duchaine, Caroline","journal":"Atmospheric Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a627a55955eb5f3f5b158e5ae9c75fdba386fbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.03.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015002630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288547/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231015002630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-culturable microorganisms","non-culturable environmental microorganisms","non-culturable fraction of bioaerosols","new non-culturable data","impact of bioaerosol exposure","new research","bioaerosol characterisation","complex bioaerosol burden","indoor settings","study of bioaerosols","significant impact","development of new tools","bioaerosol-related diseases","archaea","literature","viruses","Culture techniques","respiratory health","small fraction","human health","available molecular tools","real airborne microbial burden","states various research needs","quantification","consultants","detection","air quality specialists","field","bacteria","recovery","Abstract","past","inability","point of comparison","agar plates","studies","article"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI and WORI groups). METHODS: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath\u00AE kit) from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus, influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human metapneumovirus (n = 1). In the WRI group, respiratory viruses were detected in 12 of the 24 patients: influenza AH3 (n = 3), human rhinovirus (n = 3), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 3), human metapneumovirus (n = 3), human bocavirus (n = 2) and human enterovirus (n = 1). Simultaneous detection of two viruses was recorded in two samples in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the presence of common respiratory viruses in the lower respiratory tract without causing symptomatic infection, even in carefully collected lower samples. This may have important implications on the interpretation of the results on the diagnostic setting.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazareth, Raquel; Chasqueira, Maria-Jesus; Rodrigues, Maria-L\u00FAcia; Paulino, Carolina; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o, Catarina; L\u00EAdo, Lia; Segura, \u00DArsula; Santos, Madalena; Messias, Ant\u00F3nio; P\u00F3voa, Pedro; Paix\u00E3o, Paulo","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2089844227bd2ff234044e4b311bf1c2bcb3838c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7020345.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-020-1082-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32054471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Lisbon"],"keyphrases":["human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","human bocavirus","human enterovirus","respiratory syncytial virus","human microbiome","presence of respiratory viruses","Respiratory virome","human coronavirus group","lower respiratory tract","presence of common respiratory viruses","human parainfluenza virus types","acute respiratory failure","acute lower respiratory infections","lower samples","WRI group","repiratory syncytial virus","RESULTS","treatment of patients","influenza AH3","WORI groups","lower airways of individuals","study","symptomatic infection","mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples","adenovirus","Intensive Care Units","kit","invasive mechanical ventilation","hospitals","double catheter","interpretation","mean age","Combicath","characterization","decade","changes","better understanding","NL63","BACKGROUND","approach","Lisbon area","important implications","diagnostic setting","OC43","Simultaneous detection","CONCLUSIONS","Real-time PCR","HKU1","disease","METHODS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Abdominal ultrasound revealed severe jejunal and ileocolic junction intestinal wall thickening with loss of layering. An enterectomy was performed and histopathology revealed severe pyogranulomatous enteritis with vasculitits, compatible with the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Four days after surgery, the cat re-presented with anorexia and acute onset of expiratory dyspnoea. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and bilateral atrial enlargement. Congestive heart failure caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was suspected and treatment with furosemide was started, which led to amelioration of the clinical signs. The following day, four-limb ataxia, hypermetria and bilateral uveitis were evident. Given the persistent anorexia and worsening of the clinical signs, the cat was humanely euthanized and a post-mortem examination was performed. Necropsy revealed multifocal pyogranulomatous lesions involving multiple organs (adrenal glands, kidneys, lungs, brain, myocardium, lymph nodes, liver), compatible with the diagnosis of FIP. Immunohistochemistry performed on the myocardium revealed feline coronavirus-positive macrophages associated with pyogranulomatous lesions, justifying a diagnosis of feline coronavirus-associated myocarditis.

There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as co-morbid conditions associated with COVID-19. Objective To extend our work in interleukin (IL)-13 biology to determine if airway epithelial cell expression of two key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are modulated by IL-13. Methods We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in two datasets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Results IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In two independent datasets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines while TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines. Conclusion IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma. This deserves further study with regard to any effects asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kimura, Hiroki; Francisco, Dave; Conway, Michelle; Martinez, Fernando D.; Vercelli, Donata; Polverino, Francesca; Billheimer, Dean; Kraft, Monica","journal":"The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/319182a44a8564168a77a75bc5b2fe3c50634b78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920306473?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920306473; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ACE2","ACE2 expression","airway epithelial cell expression","increased TMPRSS2 expression ex","primary airway epithelial cells","reduced ACE2","type","effects asthma","gene expression data","effects of IL","Results IL","Conclusion IL","nasal","severe COVID","allergic rhinitis","setting of COVID","infection","cytokines","Abstract Background SARS-CoV","independent datasets","key mediators critical","adults","children","participants","treatment","biology","risk factors","transmembrane protease","controversy","interleukin","atopy","regard","enzyme","angiotensin","serine","co-morbid conditions","world","country","communities","families","disease","work","study","Objective","allergy","Methods","bronchoscopy"],"language":"en"},

Whether the same occurs during acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and role that IL-10 might play in liver disease is currently unknown. Methods Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with HBV, were used to analyse the role of CD8\u002B T cell-derived IL-10 in liver immunopathology. Results Mouse HBV-specific effector CD8\u002B T cells produce significant amounts of IL-10 upon in vivo antigen encounter. This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL-10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8\u002B T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8\u002B T cell-derived IL-10 was found to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to enhance IL-2 responsiveness, thus preventing antigen-induced HBV-specific effector CD8\u002B T cell apoptosis. Accordingly, the use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis revealed that the IL-10 produced by effector CD8\u002B T cells promoted their own intrahepatic survival and, thus supported, rather than suppressed liver immunopathology. Conclusion Effector CD8\u002B T cell-derived IL-10 enhances acute liver immunopathology. Altogether, these results extend our understanding of the cell- and tissue-specific role that IL-10 exerts in immune regulation. Lay summary: Interleukin-10 is mostly regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine. We show here that HBV-specific CD8\u002B T cells produce IL-10 upon antigen recognition and that this cytokine enhances CD8\u002B T cell survival. As such, IL-10 paradoxically promotes rather than suppresses liver disease.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fioravanti, Jessica; Di Lucia, Pietro; Magini, Diletta; Moalli, Federica; Boni, Carolina; Benechet, Alexandre Pierre; Fumagalli, Valeria; Inverso, Donato; Vecchi, Andrea; Fiocchi, Amleto; Wieland, Stefan; Purcell, Robert; Ferrari, Carlo; Chisari, Francis V.; Guidotti, Luca G.; Iannacone, Matteo","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea1002a17ada9616294ad293210211a35787fce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127652.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827817320019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28483675/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2017.04.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827817320019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims","HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell-derived IL","HBV-specific CD8","T cells","role of CD8","serum IL","T cell survival","T cell infiltration","T cell apoptosis","intrahepatic CD8","Conclusion Effector CD8","Results Mouse HBV-specific effector CD8","human CD8","antigen-induced HBV-specific effector CD8","significant amounts of IL","acute liver immunopathology","effector molecules","suppressed liver immunopathology","Methods Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis","use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis","liver disease severity","acute infection","tissue-specific role","antigen recognition","intrahepatic survival","antigen encounter","regulatory cytokine interleukin","immunosuppressive cytokine","acute hepatitis B virus","chemokines","secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines","responsiveness","chimpanzees","paracrine fashion","Background","certain viruses","understanding","longitudinal data","Lay summary","patients","immune regulation"],"language":"en"},

The ability of HRV-C to grow equally well at 34\u00B0C and 37\u00B0C may contribute to the propensity for HRV-C to cause lower airway illnesses in infants and children with asthma.","publish_time":"2013-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashraf, Shamaila; Brockman-Schneider, Rebecca; Bochkov, Yury A.; Pasic, Thomas R.; Gern, James E.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/370d59bf7f643eb4a7f419b7cf31b3b67c6e0b13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3545098.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23199420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682212005491; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212005491","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Information","HSEC ALI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-C15","replication of HRV","HRV types","HRV-C41","ability of HRV","C replication","quantitative studies of HRV","logs growth of HRV","basic biological properties of human rhinovirus-C","HSEC ALI","viruses","human sinuses","optimal growth","Differentiated cultures","quantitative RT-PCR","cell culture system","acid lability","lower airway illnesses","useful tool","Epithelial cells","infants","children","distinguishing features of HRVs","Abstract Information","asthma","liquid interface","difficulties","contrast","propensity","low pH","objective","culturing"],"language":"en"},

Due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing SEDs from some patients, producing SEDs from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity. A major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission. We therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of SEDs to resolve DES in a rabbit model. Sera prepared from the blood of five rabbits were pooled and divided into two sub-pools. One was untreated (SEDs), while the other was virally-inactivated with 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 at 31\u00B0C for 1 h (S/D-SEDs). DES was induced in rabbits using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Rabbits were divided into five groups of two rabbits each. One group was untreated (control), three were treated twice daily for 3 weeks using PBS, SEDs, or S/D-SEDs, and the last received an additional 0.1% BAC (as the negative control). The DES condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion (Schirmer\u2019s test), corneal fluorescein staining, a corneal histologic examination, TUNEL stain apoptosis, and corneal inflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-8, and IL-6) expressions. We first confirmed that SEDs and S/D-SEDs had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B2 contents. Animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the SED and S/D-SED groups but was significantly higher than in the PBS group. Eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs, and hematoxylin/eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls. Inflammatory markers and TUNEL studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs. In conclusion, this preclinical study supports the possibility of using S/D virally inactivated SEDs to treat DES and restore a normal epithelium.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Ching-Li; Chen, Zhi-Yu; Renn, Ting-Yi; Hsiao, Shun-Hung; Burnouf, Thierry","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4839776.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27100624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["S/D-SEDs","SED and S/D-SED","PBS","TUNEL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D-SEDs","treatment of SEDs","inactivated SEDs","D-SED groups","rabbits","DES condition","corneal fluorescein staining","Eye fluorescein staining","corneal inflammatory marker","eosin staining","allogeneic blood donations","possibility","BAC","PBS group","untreated controls","corneal histologic examination","aqueous tear secretion","growth factor","microscopic epithelial layers similar","epithelial defects","TUNEL studies","Inflammatory markers","severe dry-eye syndrome","healthy epithelium","\u03B2 contents","normal epithelium","negative control","Application of autologous serum eye drops","TUNEL stain apoptosis","similar protein profiles","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","Schirmer\u2019s test","dramatic improvements","interleukin","hematoxylin","butyl phosphate","TGF","recognized means","detergent","patients","major safety concern","solvent","Triton X","preclinical study","virus transmission","Tri-n","Animal experiments","popularity","benzalkonium chloride","difficulty","viruses","impacts","rabbit model","conclusion","inconvenience","weeks","sub-pools","expressions","Sera"],"language":"en"},

In several animal models of human diseases, MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs. Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Influenza viruses constantly evolve, thus generating drug-resistant strains and rendering current vaccines less effective against the newly generated strains. Therefore, new therapies that can control virus replication and the inflammatory response of the host are needed. The objective of this study was to examine if MSC-EV treatment can attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a preclinical model. METHODS: We isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs. Morphology of MSC-EVs was determined by electron microscopy and expression of mesenchymal markers was examined by flow cytometry. Next, we examined the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs in vitro in lung epithelial cells and anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties in vivo in a pig model of influenza virus. RESULTS: MSC-EVs were isolated from MSC-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation. MSC-EVs were round-shaped and, similarly to MSCs, expressed mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of swine leukocyte antigens I and II. Incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs with lung epithelial cells revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells. Next, we examined the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs inhibited the hemagglutination activity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses at concentrations of 1.25\u20135 \u03BCg/ml. MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. The anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs. In a pig model of influenza virus, intratracheal administration of MSC-EVs 12 h after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of influenza-infected pigs. The histopathological findings revealed that MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced lung lesions in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated in a relevant preclinical large animal model of influenza virus that MSC-EVs possessed anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties and that EVs may be used as cell-free therapy for influenza in humans.","publish_time":"2018-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khatri, Mahesh; Richardson, Levi Arthur; Meulia, Tea","journal":"Stem Cell Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b7d76ba81c3eb5ddf6e9330e16ce1189fe1f08b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5789598.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-018-0774-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication","anti-influenza activity of MSC","influenza virus infection","lungs of influenza","MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced lung lesions","pig model of influenza virus","Morphology of MSC","human influenza viruses","anti-inflammatory properties of MSC","pre-incubation of MSC","reduced virus","intratracheal administration of MSC","MSC-EV treatment","MSC-conditioned medium","relevant preclinical large animal model of influenza virus","virus-induced apoptosis","lung epithelial cells","virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines","preclinical model","acute lung injury","expression of mesenchymal markers","immunomodulatory properties","hemagglutination activity of avian","swine bone marrow-derived MSCs","Mesenchymal stem","beneficial effects of MSCs","expression of swine leukocyte antigens","animal models of human diseases","generated strains","infected pigs","Incubation of PKH","drug-resistant strains","annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness","secreting paracrine factors","tissue repair functions","RNase enzyme","immunoregulatory","nasal swabs","electron microscopy","current vaccines","significant mortality","extracellular vesicles","transfer of RNAs","data","cell-free therapy","inflammatory response","concentrations","\u03BCg","histopathological findings","morbidity","BACKGROUND","flow cytometry","ultracentrifugation","humans","new therapies","host","study","METHODS","RESULTS","objective","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports. Four neuroradiologists evaluated all neuroimaging studies for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19. Results 14.1% of admitted COVID-19 patients had neuroimaging and this accounted for only 5.5% of the total imaging studies. Acute stroke was the most common finding on neuro-imaging, seen in 92.5% of patients with positive neuro-imaging studies, and present in 1.1% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with acute large ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke had much higher mortality risk adjusted for age, BMI and hypertension compared to those COVID-19 patients without neuroimaging. (Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). Conclusions Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detection of an acute stroke is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome. Our study also highlights the fact there is limited use of neuroimaging in these patients due to multiple logistical constraints.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Rajan; Young, Matthew; Dogra, Siddhant; Kennedy, Helena; Nguyen, Vinh; Jones, Simon; Bilaloglu, Seda; Hochman, Katherine; Raz, Eytan; Galetta, Steven; Horwtiz, Leora","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67f3c89540457efb8d9ded98a9a4936b447234a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302604?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302604; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neuroimaging studies","hospitalized COVID","confirmed patients","acute neuroimaging findings","Acute stroke","common neuroimaging","admitted COVID","spectrum of neuroimaging findings","limited use of neuroimaging","total imaging studies","hemorrhagic stroke","positive neuro-imaging studies","imaging reports","New York City","common finding","retrospective cohort study","prognostic role","Hazard Ratio","Clinical data","Odds Ratio","strong prognostic marker of poor outcome","higher mortality risk","hospitals","age","LR","BMI","major healthcare system","incidence","electronic medical records","fact","neurological symptoms","multiple logistical constraints","CRR","Methods","hypertension","Conclusions","neuroradiologists","Abstract Objective","Results","Detection"],"language":"en"},

One hundred and three serum or plasma samples were selected and tested: 70 were positive by both tests, 24 were negative by both tests. The in-practice test produced five false positive and four false negative results. The sensitivity of the in-practice test was 95% and the specificity was 83%. When the titres were compared it was found that the in-practice test results were significantly correlated with IFA titres but the degree of correlation was not likely to be clinically useful. The IFA titres of the four false negative samples were found to be low (less than 40) which suggests that even a cat with a false negative result is still unlikely to be excreting FCoV. A negative result with the in-practice assay is likely to be reliable for screening cats prior to entry into an FCoV-free cattery or stud. It would also be useful in the investigation of suspected FIP as most cats with this condition have high IFA titres of antibodies. A strong positive result would be useful in the diagnosis of FIP (in conjunction with other biochemical and cytological testing), but positive results would be of limited value in monitoring FCoV infection in healthy cats as the antibody titre could not be reliably compared with those obtained with IFA. All positive results obtained using the in-practice kit should be confirmed and titrated by IFA. The kit also appeared to work efficiently with ascites samples (n=6) but too few samples were analysed to draw firm conclusions.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addie, Diane D.; McLachlan, Shona A.; Golder, Matthew; Ramsey, Ian; Jarrett, Oswald","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a16486a83cdb5e7d03a39f376219a97591eaadc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128989.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X04000233; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X04000233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Biogal Galed Laboratories","IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["practice test results","positive results","false negative results","false negative samples","practice kit","FCoV Immunocomb","practice assay","high IFA titres of antibodies","strong positive result","monitoring FCoV infection","FCoV-free cattery","plasma samples","ascites samples","gold standard FCoV immunofluorescent antibody","healthy cats","screening cats","tests","diagnosis of FIP","antibody titre","investigation of suspected FIP","limited value","comparison","entry","condition","feline coronavirus","Biogal Galed Laboratories","conjunction","cytological testing","degree of correlation","stud","serum","firm conclusions","sensitivity","specificity"],"language":"en"},

While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) \u201Chot spot\u201D in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.","publish_time":"2008-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sui, Jianhua; Aird, Daniel R.; Tamin, Azaibi; Murakami, Akikazu; Yan, Meiying; Yammanuru, Anuradha; Jing, Huaiqi; Kan, Biao; Liu, Xin; Zhu, Quan; Yuan, Qing-an; Adams, Gregory P.; Bellini, William J.; Xu, Jianguo; Anderson, Larry J.; Marasco, Wayne A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee0d298d09635c5ae72d4584fba105a705d25afb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2572002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BnAbs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human SARS coronaviruses","driving SARS-CoV evolution","SARS-CoV spike protein","human viruses","SARS-CoVs","intra-species transmission of SARS","CoV infected animal","protein of animal","amino acid changes","immune pressure","neutralization activity","strategies","detailed examination of SARS","non-immune human VL chain repertoire","strain-specific","human convalescent sera","light chain CDR","virus evolution pathways","hot-spot CDR mutagenesis","combination of chain","hot spot","single VL CDR","result of positive selection","cross-strain","R escape mutants","dominant escape mutation","dominant neutralization epitope","BnAbs","shuffling","result of inter-species adaptation","driving force","strong evidence","targeted mutagenesis","activation-induced cytidine deaminase","AID","responses","use of structural information","SHM","role of neutralizing antibodies","region","therapies","complementarity","natural infection","broad","Phylogenetic analyses","study","studies","Structure","Somatic hypermutation","zoonotic transfers","strains","results"],"language":"en"},

Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sha, Zhou; Shang, Hongqi; Miao, Yongqiang; Huang, Jin; Niu, Xiangyun; Chen, Ruichang; Hu, Liping; Huang, He; Wei, Kai; Zhu, Ruiliang","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60dc97efd7dd7a7397593669cfbe2f89b67d6af4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105734.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32266297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lactis strain","endemic H9N2 virus strain","recombinant fusion protein","H9N2 virus-specific","H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein","control H9N2 virus infection","mucosal immune responses","novel Lactococcus lactis","improved control of H9N2 viruses","day-old chickens","H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus","cellular immune responses","mucosal secretory IgA","dpv","HA2 proteins","study","protective effects","secretory peptide","experimental groups","reduced lung pathological damage","decreased weight loss","lower viral titers","T cell","increased levels of serum antibodies","sera","significant design improvement","LPAIV","theoretical basis","intestinal samples","enormous economic losses","poultry industry","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","previous studies","disease","inactivated vaccines","oral vaccine","systemic immunity","days post-vaccination","gene","SIgA","immunogenicity","results","challenge","immunization","Western blotting","summary"],"language":"en"},

The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p \u003C 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p \u003C 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p \u003C 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p \u003C 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p \u003C 0.1558) (p \u003C 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p \u003C 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p \u003C 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.","publish_time":"1994-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broderick, Patricia A.; Phelan, Frank T.; Eng, Frank; Wechsler, Robert T.","journal":"Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/253af824466307bf9415fd7419f6029dc9180939.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0091305794900922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305794900922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ibogaine"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ibogaine-cocaine interactions","efficacy of ibogaine","Abstract Ibogaine","HT release","ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation","behavioral parameters","NAcc DA release","behavioral responses","SC","cocaine-induced increase","cocaine-induced decrease","parameters of behavior","rearing behavior","cocaine modulatory effects","fine movement behavior","behavioral data point","novel behavioral chamber","central ambulation behavior","central ambulations","HTergic responses","habituation","fine movements","fine movement patterns","critical modulatory role","extended time","individual time points","computerized infrared photocell beam detection","behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats","stereotypy","dopamine","locomotor activity","thigmotaxis","center","intensity","indole alkaloid","seconds","serotonin","natural tendency","h period","agoraphobia","electrochemistry","nucleus","IP","consecutive days","voltammetry","animals","environment","DAergic","weak psychostimulant","hand","results"],"language":"en"},

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), in consultation with sport partners (National Institute Network (NIN) Directors, NIN Chief Medical Officers (CMOs), National Sporting Organisation (NSO) Presidents, NSO Performance Directors and NSO CMOs), has developed a framework to inform the resumption of sport. National Principles for Resumption of Sport were used as a guide in the development of \u2018the AIS Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 Environment\u2019 (the AIS Framework); and based on current best evidence, and guidelines from the Australian Federal Government, extrapolated into the sporting context by specialists in sport and exercise medicine, infectious diseases and public health.

Methods From 2004 to 2006, adults with CAP who were admitted to five hospitals were prospectively enrolled in the study, and clinical data, cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. NATs from swabs were tested for influenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenovirus. Results A total of 193 patients were included; the median age was 71 years, 51% of patients were male, and 47% of patients had severe CAP. Overall, 75 patients (39%) had a pathogen identified. Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were \u201Cunknown.\u201D Influenza (n = 7), hMPV (n = 7), and RSV (n = 5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n = 4), parainfluenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%). Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p = 0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p = 0.02). There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection. Conclusions Viral infections are common in adults with pneumonia. Easily transmissible viruses such as influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common, raising concerns about infection control. Routine testing for respiratory viruses may be warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnstone, Jennie; Majumdar, Sumit R.; Fox, Julie D.; Marrie, Thomas J.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/151a439b6428f86aa27817330f60e8577f7a5580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18689592/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369209600118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209600118; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.08-0888","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","adults","common bacterial infection","bacterial infections","absence of viral infection","hMPV","Conclusions Viral infections","infection control","RSV","transmissible viruses","potential role of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","rhinovirus","parainfluenza virus","NATs","years","CAP","adenovirus","limited ambulation vs","meaningful differences","nasopharyngeal swabs","cultures","natural history of community","serology","presence","human metapneumovirus","study","clinical data","advent of nucleic amplification tests","outcomes","presentation","coronaviruses","Streptococcus pneumoniae","OC43","NL63","cardiac disease","median age","Routine testing","concerns","hospitals","male","rest","pathogens","Methods","total"],"language":"en"},

In the last decade, several members of the same virus families have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans. Fortunately, these viruses have not become established in humans, because they lacked the ability of sustained transmission between humans. However, these outbreaks highlighted the lack of understanding of what makes a virus transmissible. In part triggered by the relatively high frequency of occurrence of influenza A virus zoonoses and pandemics, the influenza research community has started to investigate the viral genetic and biological traits that drive virus transmission via aerosols or respiratory droplets between mammals. Here we summarize recent discoveries on the genetic and phenotypic traits required for airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes H5, H7 and H9 and pandemic viruses of subtypes H1, H2 and H3. Increased understanding of the determinants and mechanisms of respiratory virus transmission is not only key from a basic scientific perspective, but may also aid in assessing the risks posed by zoonotic viruses to human health, and preparedness for such risks.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richard, Mathilde; Fouchier, Ron A.M.","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cfec61753b072e72aa52b6c48a77e68133b3f18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5006288.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuv039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26385895/; https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-pdf/40/1/68/10741257/fuv039.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses of humans","zoonotic viruses","mechanisms of respiratory virus transmission","virus zoonoses","virus families","virus transmissible","airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes H5","pandemic viruses of subtypes H1","ability of sustained transmission","respiratory droplets","animals","risks","influenza research community","phenotypic traits","biological traits","Increased understanding","lack of understanding","H9","H7","pandemics","key","determinants","aerosols","orthomxoviruses","H2","human health","species barrier","high frequency of occurrence","preparedness","recent discoveries","recurrent epidemics","paramyxoviruses","coronaviruses","basic scientific perspective","H3","mammals","members","outbreaks","instance","decade","hosts"],"language":"en"},

Thirty-one Holstein calves were used to determine health and performance of calves that were 1) allowed to remain with their dams for 3 d and suckle (suckled calves) or were removed from their dams and fed colostrum only by bottle (bottle calves); and were 2) fed ground, pelleted, or textured starters, formulated to be isonitrogenous. Bottle calves were removed from their dams at birth, fed 2.84L of colostrum, placed in individual hutches, and fed 1.89L of colostrum 12h after the first feeding. Suckled calves were removed from their dams after 3 d and placed in individual hutches. Once calves were housed in hutches, they were fed 2L of whole milk twice daily and were provided starters and water beginning on d 3. Calves were weighed at birth and weekly for 6 wk. Blood samples were obtained at birth, 24h, and weekly for serum protein determination. Starter intake, fecal scores, and electrolyte treatments were recorded daily. Weaning began when calves had consumed 0.68kg starter for 2 d consecutively. There were no differences in treatment means between suckled and bottle calves for total gain, grain consumption, days with fecal scores \u003E2, or electrolyte treatments per calf. Average days to weaning was greater for bottle calves compared with suckled calves.

PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p\u003C0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Mielech, Anna M; Hackbart, Matthew; Kesely, Kristina R; Mettelman, Robert C; O\u0027Brien, Amornrat; Chapman, Mackenzie E; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baker, Susan C","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01734-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP2 DUB activity","role of DUB activity","DUB mutant virus","protease activity","DUB mutation","DUBmut virus infections","wild-type virus infection","polyprotein processing activity","ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2","termed PLP2","PLP2 acts","ubiquitin complex","ubiquitin moieties","interferon response","ubiquitin-binding residues results","IFN response","ubiquitin-conjugated proteins","earlier type","viral replication","coronavirus pathogenesis","de-conjugating ubiquitin","DUBmut-infected mice","interferon antagonist","host interferon","identification of critical determinants of PLP2","coronavirus papain","viral replicase polyprotein","reduced replication","cultured macrophages","structure-guided mutagenesis approach","X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis","viral titer","innate immune response","recombinant murine coronavirus","post-infection","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","multifunctional proteins","multifunctional papain","study","identical catalytic residues","virulence trait of coronaviruses","functional studies","earlier times","cultured cells","host environment","amino acid substitutions","negative regulator","spleens","modified substrates","molecules","genetic economy","day","livers","Ala","enzyme","similar liver pathology","significant reduction","Asp1772","domain"],"language":"en"},

The major cause of myocarditis in the paediatric population is viral infection, including coxsackievirus B3, adenovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, influenza A and B, and hepatitis. Here, we report the detection of rhinovirus C in a boy with a clinical presentation of myocarditis, suggesting a possible causative role of this virus in this case. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously well 4.5-year-old boy presented with increasing breathlessness for a week prior to admission. He also had upper respiratory tract infection a few days before the event. An echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction with dilation of the LV. RNA was extracted from serum and two nasal swabs, and tested with conventional PCR at the family level for viruses including enterovirus, dengue, chikungunya, influenza, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus. Further characterization of the enterovirus group was carried out using PCR with primers targeting the VP4/VP2 gene, followed by sequencing. Molecular tests showed the presence of rhinovirus C genetic material in both serum and swab samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2 region showed 96\u201397 % similarity with the closest strain isolated in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) and Japan in 2012.

The objectives of this study were to measure (1) audited compliance of primary health-care facilities in South Africa with national standards for OHS and IPC, (2) change in compliance at reaudit three years after baseline, and (3) the inter-rater reliability of the audit. METHODS: The study analyzed audits of 60 primary health-care facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Baseline external audits in the time period 2011\u20132012 were compared with follow-up internal audits in 2014\u20132015. Audits at 25 facilities that had both internal and external audits conducted in 2014/2015 were used to measure reliability. RESULTS: At baseline, 25% of 60 facilities were \u201Cnoncompliant\u201D (audit score\u003C50%), 48% \u201Cconditionally compliant\u201D (score \u003E50 \u003C 80%), and only 27% \u201Ccompliant\u201D (score \u003E80%). Overall, there was no significant improvement in compliance three years after baseline. Percentage agreement on specific items between internal and external audits ranged from 28% to 92% and kappa from -0.8 to 0.41 (poor to moderate). CONCLUSION: Low baseline compliance with OHS\u2013IPC measures and lack of improvement over three years reflect the difficulties of quality improvement in these domains. Low inter-rater reliability of the audit instrument undermines the audit process. Evidence-based investment of effort is required if repeat auditing is to contribute to occupational risk reduction for health workers.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cloete, Brynt; Yassi, Annalee; Ehrlich, Rodney","journal":"Saf Health Work","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a50b31b20869c7fe66f9d850c228211c04819956.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7078524.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2019.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OHS"],"locations":["Western Cape","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["Baseline external audits","Low baseline compliance","health workers","compliance of primary health-care facilities","audit score","quality of occupational health","follow-up internal audits","years","audit instrument","audit process","Low inter-rater reliability","elevated risk of occupational infection","occupational risk reduction","IPC measures","difficulties of quality improvement","lack of improvement","significant improvement","study","infection prevention","repeat auditing","Western Cape Province of South Africa","specific items","tuberculosis","national standards","safety","Percentage agreement","countries","question","Evidence-based investment of effort","time period","control","domains","BACKGROUND","change","CONCLUSION","METHODS","poor","objectives","RESULTS","kappa"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drugs against the ASFV. How to effectively control the virus is challenging. In this study, we have analyzed all the publicly available ASFV genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes. Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. Further analyses showed that the indels may be attributed much to the homologous recombination, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Besides, the homologous recombination also led to changes of gene content of ASFVs. Finally, repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. This work highlighted the importance of homologous recombination in shaping the genetic diversity of the ASFVs, and could help understand the evolution of the virus.","publish_time":"2019-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zhaozhong; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Fan, Yunshi; Cai, Zena; Lu, Congyu; Zhang, Gaihua; Jiang, Taijiao; Tan, Yongjun; Peng, Yousong","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d7a335f5eeda373b7fc5712528d0e52e1e83013.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172151.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304183; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304183; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of homologous recombination","available ASFV genomes","large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes","importance of homologous recombination","adjacent positions of ASFV genomes","indels","occurrence of extensive recombination events","African swine fever virus","swine industry","extensive genomic insertions","changes of gene content of ASFVs","significant associations","nucleotides","deletions","repeated elements of dozens","length","effective vaccine","drugs","cluster","work","world","point mutations","evolution","analyses","study"],"language":"en"},

More recently, it was proposed that they could play a role in the antigen presentation to T lymphocytes but contradictory results have been published both concerning their surface expressed molecules and the T lymphocyte responses in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The use of either AECII cell line or fresh cells could explain the observed discrepancies. Thus, this study aimed at defining the most relevant model of accessory antigen presenting cells by carefully comparing the two models for their expression of surface molecules necessary for efficient antigen presentation. METHODS: We have compared by flow cytometry the surface expression of the major markers involved in the immunological synapse on the A549 cell line, the most popular model of type II alveolar epithelial cells, and freshly isolated cells. HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, ICOS-L, CD54, CD58 surface expression were studied in resting conditions as well as after IFN-\u03B3/TNF-\u03B1 treatment, two inflammatory cytokines, known to modulate some of these markers. RESULTS: The major difference found between the two cells types was the very low surface expression of HLA-DR on the A549 cell line compared to its constitutive expression on freshly isolated AECII. The surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules from the B7 family was very low for the CD86 (B7-2) and ICOS-L (B7-H2) and absent for CD80 (B7-1) on both freshly isolated cells and A549 cell line. Neither IFN-\u03B3 nor TNF-\u03B1 could increase the expression of these classical co-stimulatory molecules. However CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3) adhesion molecules, known to be implicated in B7 independent co-stimulatory signals, were well expressed on the two cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive expression of MHC class I and II molecules as well as alternative co-stimulatory molecules by freshly isolated AECII render these cells a good model to study antigen presentation.","publish_time":"2011-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corbi\u00E8re, V\u00E9ronique; Dirix, Violette; Norrenberg, Sarah; Cappello, Matt\u00E9o; Remmelink, Myriam; Mascart, Fran\u00E7oise","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12fe4cca998a403e153ae872595eab2676c77d2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3033824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261956/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-12-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolated cells","surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules","expression of surface molecules necessary","CD58 surface expression","surface expressed molecules","cells types","fresh cells","low surface expression of HLA","AECII cell line","alveolar epithelial cells","alternative co-stimulatory molecules","classical co-stimulatory molecules","adhesion molecules","A549 cell line","isolated AECII","cell types","Constitutive expression of MHC class","study antigen presentation","B7 independent co-stimulatory signals","B7 family","B7-H2","efficient antigen presentation","relevant model of accessory antigen","good model","popular model of type","HLA-DR","CD86","ICOS","IFN-\u03B3","CD80","major markers","role","CD54","T lymphocyte responses","TNF-\u03B1 treatment","T lymphocytes","major difference","contradictory results","mixed lymphocyte cultures","immunological synapse","resting conditions","CONCLUSIONS","flow cytometry","BACKGROUND","models","inflammatory cytokines","innate immune system","observed discrepancies","LFA","use","ICAM","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Review of the COVID-19 planning process and work products in preparation for a patient surge. Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented. RESULTS: The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines. The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning.

We aimed to characterise the clinical and demographic features associated with different RV species detected in children attending hospital with ARI, from low-income families in North-east Brazil. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 630 children \u003C5years with ARI. Clinical diagnosis and disease severity were also recorded. Samples were analysed by multiplex PCR for 18 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens; RV positive samples underwent partial sequencing to determine species and type. RESULTS: RV was the fourth commonest pathogen accounting for 18.7% of pathogens detected. RV was commonly detected in children with bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW). Species and type were assigned in 112 cases (73% RV-A; 27% RV-C; 0% RV-B). Generally, there were no differences in clinical or demographic characteristics between those infected with RV-A and RV-C. However, in children with asthma/EVW, RV-C was detected relatively more frequently than RV-A (23% vs 5%; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight RV as a potentially important pathogen in this setting. Generally, clinical and demographic features were similar in children in whom RV A and C species were detected. However, RV-C was more frequently found in children with asthma/EVW than RV-A.","publish_time":"2015-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fawkner-Corbett, DW; Khoo, SK; Duarte, MC; Bezerra, PGM; Bochkov, YA; Gern, JE; Le Souef, PN; McNamara, PS","journal":"Journal of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/058e30a76f6370b670ce016db713ad29d34b6f8e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/abe5e9c9e74ea0d0ebf941cf4bdfdc50f67a8dcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4682890.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100591/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4682890?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.24300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["RV-C","RV-B","children","different RV species","RV positive samples","C species","asthma","ARI","EVW","demographic features","Clinical diagnosis","demographic characteristics","type","important pathogen","atypical bacterial pathogens","episodic viral wheeze","commonest pathogen accounting","partial sequencing","pneumonia","common cause of acute respiratory infection","hospital","low-income families","multiplex PCR","bronchiolitis","North-east Brazil","Human rhinovirus","disease severity","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","findings","INTRODUCTION","differences","METHODS","setting","vs","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","cases","years"],"language":"en"},

Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn2\u002B ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase. Based on the properties of active-site mutants, we conclude that the RNA-synthesizing activities observed in de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase assays cannot be attributed to recombinant EAV nsp9-RdRp.

It is a fairly reasonable and well accepted representation of the competition in the airline industry, assuming that the structure of their networks is given in the short run. The present solidarity tax has increased the average price for the European airlines by only 0.08 % and could increase average prices by 1 % if it were applied to all European airlines.

The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified. METHODS: We introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. RESULTS: Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.

RECENT FINDINGS: Complex protocols are required to safely use portable imaging in EVD to prevent nosocomial spread of disease. In ZVD, antenatal ultrasound can detect fetal abnormalities early, allowing implementation of care and support to affected families. Imaging is useful in assessing the extent of involvement of chronic CHIKF and monitoring treatment effect. Chest radiography and CT play a more direct role in the diagnosis and monitoring of the viral infections with primarily respiratory manifestations (H1N1, MERS, and SARS). SUMMARY: Radiology plays a variable role in emerging infectious diseases, requiring an understanding of disease transmission and safe imaging practices, as well as imaging features that affect clinical management.","publish_time":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jardon, Meghan; Mohammad, Shaden F.; Jude, Cecilia M.; Pahwa, Anokh","journal":"Curr Radiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23e31a2e7f6d6ea78cf50da16ed0d5cca70b3c6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226652/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40134-019-0338-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["role of radiology","imaging features","portable imaging","Emerging infectious diseases","H1N1","MERS","respiratory manifestations","variable role","direct role","safe imaging practices","EVD","diagnosis","ZVD","SARS","Middle East Respiratory","monitoring treatment effect","understanding of disease transmission","chronic CHIKF","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","clinical management","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","nosocomial spread of disease","extent of involvement","viral infections","fetal abnormalities","record increase","implementation of care","antenatal ultrasound","Zika","current literature","viruses","Ebola","Chikungunya","Complex protocols","RECENT FINDINGS","support","prevalence","SUMMARY","Chest radiography","global community","families"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) less than 10 years later demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross species boundaries and further highlights the importance of identifying novel lead compounds with broad spectrum activity. The coronavirus 3CL(pro) provides a highly validated drug target and as there is a high degree of sequence homology and conservation in main chain architecture the design of broad spectrum inhibitors is viable. The ZINC drugs-now library was screened in a consensus high-throughput pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking approach by Vina, Glide, GOLD and MM-GBSA. Molecular dynamics further confirmed results obtained from structure-based techniques. A highly defined hit-list of 19 compounds was identified by the structure-based drug design methodologies. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds is bioactive is excellent. Additionally, the compounds segregate into 15 significantly dissimilar (p \u003C 0.05) clusters based on shape and features, which represent valuable scaffolds that can be used as a basis for future anti-coronaviral inhibitor discovery experiments. Importantly though, the enriched subset of 19 compounds identified from the larger library has to be validated experimentally.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Michael; Fielding, Burtram C.; Gamieldien, Junaid","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed526e1eb5a7607af2803906e2f6d4e5bb2dff09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690886.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694449/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7122963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GOLD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["novel lead compounds","Molecular dynamics","molecular docking approach","consensus approach","structure-based drug design methodologies","structure-based techniques","validated drug target","design of broad spectrum inhibitors","broad spectrum activity","potential of coronaviruses","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Human coronaviruses","larger library","consensus high-throughput pharmacophore modeling","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","high degree of sequence homology","conservation","main chain architecture","SARS","Glide","Vina","future anti-coronaviral inhibitor discovery experiments","basis","MERS","importance","results","cross species boundaries","features","clusters","significant disease burden","GOLD","shape","years","defined hit-list","likelihood","valuable scaffolds","antiviral strategy","infection","GBSA","ZINC drugs","enriched subset"],"language":"en"},

To our knowledge, little information is available about the regulatory effect of NO on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection. This study was conducted to investigate the antiviral activity of NO generated from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), during PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice. RESULTS: GSNO released considerable NO in the culture medium of PK-15 cells, and NO was scavenged by its scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) in a dose-dependent manner. NO strongly inhibited PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells, and the antiviral effect was reversed by Hb. An in vivo assay indicated that GSNO treatment reduced the progression of PCV2 infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of PCV2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral DNA copies in serum samples. GSNO also improved the growth performance and immune organs (spleens and thymuses) of the PCV2-infected mice to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the NO-generating compound GSNO suppresses PCV2 infection in PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice, indicating that NO and its donor, GSNO, have potential value as antiviral drugs against PCV2 infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chuanmin; Wen, Libin; Xiao, Qi; He, Kongwang","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70748788b2a175a08f02878c528efbd024a45064.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5320642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222773/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-0976-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GSNO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 infection of PK","progression of PCV2 infection","percentages of PCV2","PCV2-infected mice","cells","GSNO treatment","compound GSNO","inhibited PCV2 replication","c mice","antiviral effect","antiviral activity","antiviral drugs","culture medium of PK","BALB","Hb","tissue samples","serum samples","regulatory effect","antimicrobial activity","potential value","spleens","viral DNA copies","porcine circovirus type","immune organs","biological functions","growth performance","thymuses","positive sera","reductions","little information","S-nitrosoglutathione","molecule","variety of pathogens","knowledge","dose-dependent manner","donor","degree","Nitric oxide","scavenger hemoglobin","BACKGROUND","viruses","RESULTS","assay","CONCLUSIONS","data","study"],"language":"en"},

This retrospective observational study utilised electronic health records augmented with practitioner-completed questionnaires from 3,189 cases (3,159 dogs) collected from 179 volunteer veterinary practices between April 2014 and January 2017. We used multivariable analysis to explore factors potentially associated with pharmaceutical agent prescription, and resolution of clinical signs by 10 days post-initial presentation. Use of bacteriological and/or parasitological diagnostic tests were uncommon (3.2% of cases, 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.4\u20134.0), though systemic antimicrobials were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical agents (49.7% of cases, 95% CI 46.1\u201353.2). Such prescription was associated with haemorrhagic diarrhoea (odds ratio, OR, 4.1; 95% CI 3.4\u20135.0), body temperature in excess of 39.0\u00B0C, or moderate/severe cases (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.7). Gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids) were prescribed to 37.7% of cases (95% CI 35.4\u201339.9), and were most frequently prescribed to vomiting dogs regardless of presence (OR 46.4, 95% CI 19.4\u2013110.8) or absence of blood (OR 17.1, 95% CI 13.4\u201321.9). Endoparasiticides/endectocides were prescribed to 7.8% of cases (95% CI 6.8\u20139.0), such prescription being less frequent for moderate/severe cases (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4\u20130.7), though more frequent when weight loss was recorded (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.3\u20139.0). Gastrointestinal nutraceuticals (e.g., probiotics) were dispensed to 60.8% of cases (95% CI 57.1\u201364.6), these cases less frequently presenting with moderate/severe clinical signs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5\u20130.8). Nearly a quarter of cases were judged lost to follow-up (n=754). Insured (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5\u20130.9); neutered (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3\u20130.5), or vaccinated dogs (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.3\u20130.4) were less commonly lost to follow-up. Of remaining dogs, clinical signs were deemed resolved in 95.4% of cases (95% CI 94.6\u201396.2). Provision of dietary modification advice and gastrointestinal nutraceuticals alone were positively associated with resolution (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3\u20136.1); no such associations were found for pharmaceutical agents, including antimicrobials. Hence, this study supports the view that antimicrobials are largely unnecessary for acute diarrhoea cases; this being of particular importance when considering the global threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.","publish_time":"2019-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singleton, David A.; Noble, P.

It is suspected that selected mutations in the associated Fusion (F) protein may also be important in regulating fusion activity. To better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ISAV fusion, several mutated F proteins were generated from the Scottish Nevis and Norwegian SK779/06 HPR0. Co-transfection with constructs encoding HE and F were performed, fusion activity assessed by content mixing assay and the degree of proteolytic cleavage by western blot. Substitutions in Nevis F demonstrated that K276 was the most likely cleavage site in the protein. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions at three sites and two insertions, all slightly upstream of K276, increased fusion activity. Co-expression with HE harbouring a full-length HPR produced high fusion activities when trypsin and low pH were applied. In comparison, under normal culture conditions, groups containing a mutated HE with an HPR deletion were able to generate moderate fusion levels, while those with a full length HPR HE could not induce fusion. This suggested that HPR length may influence how the HE primes the F protein and promotes fusion activation by an ubiquitous host protease and/or facilitate subsequent post-cleavage refolding steps. Variations in fusion activity through accumulated mutations on surface glycoproteins have also been reported in other orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. This may in part contribute to the different virulence and tissue tropism reported for HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes.","publish_time":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fourrier, Mickael; Lester, Katherine; Markussen, Turhan; Falk, Knut; Secombes, Christopher J.; McBeath, Alastair; Collet, Bertrand","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec7ab79619e983bb78f09c3b72c0cd36ea2f4924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4627773.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26517828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPR","ISAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISAV fusion","fusion activation","associated Fusion","viral fusion","increased fusion activity","high fusion activities","moderate fusion levels","HPR length","full-length HPR","HPR deletion","Nevis F","mutated F proteins","K276","HPR0","ISAV genotypes","degree of proteolytic cleavage","likely cleavage site","accumulated mutations","Scottish Nevis","selected mutations","Co-transfection","Co-expression","subsequent post-cleavage refolding steps","amino acid substitutions","trypsin","content mixing assay","deletions","near membrane domain","ubiquitous host protease","tissue tropism","normal culture conditions","haemagglutinin-esterase","Infectious salmon anaemia virus","low pH","surface glycoproteins","sites","groups","western blot","Norwegian SK779","stalk","Variations","different virulence","polymorphic region","comparison","insertions","constructs","underlying mechanisms","orthomyxoviruses","paramyxoviruses"],"language":"en"},

While the antiviral properties of type 1 interferon (IFN-I) are undeniable, recent studies have reported expanding and somewhat unexpected roles of IFN-I signaling during both acute and persistent viral infections. IFN-I signaling can promote morbidity and mortality through induction of aberrant inflammatory responses and recruitment of inflammatory innate immune cell populations during acute respiratory viral infections. During persistent viral infection, IFN-I signaling promotes containment of early viral replication/dissemination, however, also initiates and maintains immune suppression, lymphoid tissue disorganization, and CD4 T cell dysfunction through modulation of multiple immune cell populations. Finally, new data are emerging illuminating how specific IFN-I species regulate immune pathology and suppression during acute and persistent viral infections, respectively. Systematic characterization of the cellular populations that produce IFN-I, how the timing of IFN-I induction and intricacies of subtype specific IFN-I signaling promote pathology or immune suppression during acute and persistent viral infections should inform the development of treatments and modalities to control viral associated pathologies.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teijaro, J.

A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. MAIN BODY: We conducted a scoping review and systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: 1) healthcare provision; 2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; 3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and 4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists.

The miR-17-92 gene cluster is a highly conserved oncogene cluster encoding six miRNAs: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a and miR-92a. This study explored whether these miRNAs can be used as diagnostic markers for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Serum samples were collected from healthy subjects (n = 23) and NSCLC patients at various stages (n = 74). Serum RNA was extracted by the TRIzol-glycogen method, and cDNA libraries were constructed by reverse transcription. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect the expression levels of the 6 miRNAs. RESULTS: The expression levels of the six miRNAs varied in different stages of NSCLC. Thus, two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, i.e., normal subjects and stage I-III patients and normal subjects and stage IV patients, of each miRNA were established to determine the interval of normal \u0394Ct values. The two areas under the curve (AUCs) of each miRNA were investigated (miR-17: 0.8097 and 1.000; miR-18a: 0.7388 and 0.9907; miR-19a/19b: 0.8451 and 0.5104; miR-20a: 0.8975 and 1.000; miR-92a: 0.8097 and 0.8342). In addition, a high positive correlation was discovered between miR-17 and miR-20a expression. Combining these two miRNAs can improve the screening effect of NSCLC. CONCLUSION: The miR-17-92 gene cluster can likely serve as a diagnostic marker in NSCLC.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Chenghao; Jia, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Jinbao; Sun, Qiangling; Ma, Zhongliang","journal":"Am J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16a363e36b995c059b697ed430ac0a107b0f3fae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211762.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002962920301774?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002962920301774","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NSCLC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["miRNAs","NSCLC patients","normal subjects","different stages of NSCLC","expression levels","screening effect of NSCLC","healthy subjects","conserved oncogene cluster","diagnostic markers","interval of normal \u0394Ct values","various stages","Serum samples","Serum RNA","non-small-cell lung cancer","Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","cDNA libraries","qRT-PCR","curves","TRIzol-glycogen method","ROC","high positive correlation","malignant cancers","human health","receiver","characteristic","reverse transcription","addition","AUCs","areas","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

CAstV was also recently associated with an unusual condition in chicks called \u201Cwhite chicks.\u201D Some hatcheries in certain states of Brazil have reported several incubation problems, mortality, and the presence of chicks with white plumages over the past several months. These chicks were termed locally as \u201Cwhite chicks.\u201D The present work investigated 30 chicks with this unusual condition using a multidisciplinary approach. Postmortem examination of each chick showed enlarged livers and intestines that were full of liquid and gas (30/30). The pancreas, kidneys, and spleen were pale (30/30). The other organs did not show any macroscopic alterations. CAstV, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), avian rotavirus (ARtV), avian reovirus (AReoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and fowl adenovirus group I (FAdV-1) were tested in the intestines, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard, liver, spleen, bursa, kidneys, thymus, lung, heart, brain, and yolk sac in each chick. All organs and yolk sacs were positive for CAstV in different titres and negative for the other tested viruses. The partial molecular characterization of the ORF 1b gene of CAstV using 28 sequences revealed a high similarity of the nucleotides and amino acids with sequences of CAstV from North America, Europe, and Asia, and our CAstV sequences clustered into a unique group that was separate from the other sequences. These results demonstrated that CAstV was associated with the white chick condition in Brazil. The virus was distributed in most organs, including the brain and yolk sac. These results suggest that the virus could be transmitted vertically. The molecular characterization also revealed that the CAstV associated with white chick condition was molecularly related to other CAstV sequences found worldwide.","publish_time":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nu\u00F1ez, L.

Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger\u2019s test and Begg\u2019s test, and Trim and Fill analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.

At higher doses, LPS induces rapid shock (within 10 min), leading to death within 1 h. This type of shock differs from so-called endotoxin shock, in which shock signs and death occur several hours or more later. Here, we found that platelet depletion (by a monoclonal anti-platelet antibody) prevented LPS-induced rapid shock, but increased delayed lethality. In Japan, glycyrrhizin (GL), a compound isolated from licorice, is daily and slowly infused intravenously into chronic hepatitis C patients. A single bolus intravenous injection into mice of GL (200 mg/kg or less) shortly before (or simultaneously with) LPS injection reduced the pulmonary platelet accumulation and the severity of the rapid shock, and prevented death in both the early and later periods. GL itself, at 400 mg/kg, produced no detectable abnormalities in the appearance or activity of mice. Intraperitoneal injection of aspirin or dexamethasone had only marginal effects on LPS-induced platelet responses and lethality. These results suggest that platelets play important roles in the development of both the rapid and delayed types of shock induced by LPS. Although the mechanism by which GL suppresses platelet responses and delayed lethality remains to be clarified, GL might provide a strategy for alleviating the acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in sepsis. Our results may also support the proposal by Cinatl et al. [Cinatl J, Morgenstern B, Bauer G, Chandra P, Ravenau H, Doerr HW. Glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots, and replication of SARS-associated coronavirus.

Plasmid constructs with a fragment of specific gene were used to assess sensitivity of the assay. The limit of detection ranged from 27 to 96 cDNA copies/reaction. Clinical specimens (n = 107) have been tested using new assays, immunofluorescence and monoplex qRT-PCR.

Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever. There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple\u0027s disease, and a clinical trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection. In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.","publish_time":"2007-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier","journal":"International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d05a7f53630608fb95682f704f55e8b48a0473d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126847.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857907002580; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857907002580","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ","CQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ","intracellular bacteria","agent of Q fever","interesting weapon","interesting way","antimalarial agents","intracellular pH","intracellular organisms","acidic environment","fungi","viruses","chronic Q fever","interesting mechanisms of action","future infectious diseases","lysosomotropic agents","similar effect","inhibition of uncoating","antimalarial activity","HIV infection","inhibition of glycosylation","clinical trials","proof of concept","agent of Whipple\u0027s disease","weak bases","Coxiella burnetii","half-century long use","synthesised proteins","Tropheryma whipplei","antibiotic efficacy","reference treatment","alteration of post-translational modifications","hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine","paradigm","growth","doxycycline","antiretroviral drugs","activities","human immunodeficiency virus","alkalinisation of acid vesicles","review","strong evidence","combination","data","field","Abstract Chloroquine","conclusion","progress","effects"],"language":"en"},

In Turkey there has been an increase in the number of cases during years since 2002. Humans of all ages living in endemic areas,especially those who are working as shepherds and toddlers, have high risk of acquiring CCHF. Objectives The epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the children, who were diagnosed as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were described. Study design The children infected with CCHF virus between April 2008 and October 2009, and hospitalised in Ankara D\u0131\u015Fkap\u0131 Children\u0027s and Research Hospital were included. Results Laboratory diagnosis was set by detection of CCHF IgM antibodies and/or genetic detection of CCHF virus. Thirtyone cases included to the study, and all were from the northeastern Anatolia and the southern parts of Black sea region. The mean age was 9.45\u00B14.9 years, the proportion of females was 38.7%. The majority (87%) of the cases had the history of tick bite. There was no fatal case. All the patients had the history of fever. Malaise,tonsillopharyngitis, nausea-vomiting, headache, diarrhea, myalgia and rash were the most common symptoms. The mean AST and ALT levels on the admission were 116 (range 25\u2013389) and 61 (range 8\u2013180)U/L respectively. The mean platelet count on admission was 125,000/mm3, and the lowest was 23,000/mm3. The mean of the lowest white blood cell count was 2353/mm3 and the mean of the highest lactate dehydrogenase was 861IU/L. Conclusions The clinical course of CCHF among children seems to be milder than in adults. Tonsillopharyngitis is a common symptom among children with CCHF.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tezer, Hasan; Sucakl\u0131, Iclal Ayranc\u0131; Sayl\u0131, Tulin Revide; Celikel, Elif; Yakut, Ibrahim; Kara, Ate\u015F; Tunc, Bahattin; Ergonul, Onder","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1f3e42dc80f2c40908fc721e1f62332d04c3cad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108219.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210001435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210001435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":["Turkey","Ankara","Anatolia"],"keyphrases":["clinical course of CCHF","genetic detection of CCHF virus","detection of CCHF IgM antibodies","mean AST","mean age","mm3","high risk of acquiring CCHF","mean platelet count","history of fever","admission","tonsillopharyngitis","humans","years","number of cases","Thirtyone cases","Study","range","Abstract Background Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever","laboratory characteristics","common symptoms","lowest white blood cell count","Results Laboratory diagnosis","history of tick bite","headache","IU","nausea-vomiting","southern parts of Black sea region","diarrhea","rash","myalgia","Conclusions","severe disease","highest lactate dehydrogenase","Ankara D\u0131\u015Fkap\u0131 Children\u0027s","Research Hospital","toddlers","ALT levels","northeastern Anatolia","shepherds","ages","Malaise","mortality","increase","endemic areas","proportion of females","Objectives","patients","fatal case","Turkey","adults","majority"],"language":"en"},

The ACE2 sequence is similar (sequence identities 43% and 35%, and similarities 61% and 55%, respectively) to those of the testis-specific form of ACE (tACE) and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE). The high level of sequence similarity allowed us to build a robust homology model of the ACE2 structure with a root-mean-square deviation from the aligned crystal structures of tACE and AnCE less than 0.5\u00C5. A prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site. Negatively charged ridges surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-glycoprotein, which we recently identified [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Several distinct patches of hydrophobic residues at the ACE2 surface were noted at close proximity to the charged ridges that could contribute to binding. These results suggest a possible binding region for the SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein on ACE2 and could help in the design of experiments to further elucidate the structure and function of ACE2.","publish_time":"2004-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prabakaran, Ponraj; Xiao, Xiaodong; Dimitrov, Dimiter S","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad32ef1d5258ad951cbc3e97122be4666b9434bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117316.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X03026792; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X03026792","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Res","Commun"],"keyphrases":["ACE2 sequence","ACE2 structure","ACE2 surface","function of ACE2","possible binding site","charged ridges","possible binding region","receptor-binding domain","sequence identities","AnCE","SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein","SARS virus","functional receptor","high level of sequence similarity","deep channel","angiotensin system","catalytic site","Drosophila homolog of ACE","robust homology model","aligned crystal structures of tACE","testis-specific form of ACE","square deviation","close proximity","RBD","important regulator","distinct patches of hydrophobic residues","renin","root","molecule","results","prominent feature","design of experiments","enzyme","Biochem","Biophys","Commun","similarities"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with virus-related ARTIs and determined the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their correlation with meteorological variables in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 2819 children with ARTIs were collected from August 2011 to December 2014, and used for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Seventeen respiratory viruses were detected among 691 (24.5 %) of 2819 patients. The highest prevalence of respiratory viruses was detected in the age group of less than 1 year (29.0 %), and the prevalence decreased with age. This suggests that children less than one year old are the most susceptible to infection. Influenza virus (IFV) was the most frequently detected virus (5.8 %), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) (5.7 %), enterovirus (EV) (4.3 %), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.6 %). Statistical analysis showed that epidemics of IFV, PIV and EV had distinct seasonal variations. Mean monthly temperature appeared to be the only meteorological factor associated with IFV and PIV infection. These findings will provide valuable information for decision-making, prevention and treatment of ARTIs in children.

Difficulty in RV-C cultivation and target sequence variation has precluded the development of a PCR based quantification method. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for a broad range of circulating RV-C genotypes in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). STUDY DESIGN: Four assays were designed to quantify a 296 bp region located within the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of RV-C types. These assays were based on in silico analysis of available RV-C sequences. Probes were designed to provide 100% homology to the corresponding RV-C genotypes. RESULTS: The linear dynamic range of each of the four assays spanned eight orders of magnitude (10(4)\u201310(11) copies/mL). The limit of detection for assays 1\u20134 was estimated to be 1147 copies/mL, 765 copies/mL, 1138 copies/mL and 1470 copies/mL respectively. Each assay demonstrated a strong linear relationship (r(2) = \u003E0.995) and amplification efficiency greater than 95%. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were shown to be high, with coefficients of variations lower than 8% and 15% respectively.","publish_time":"2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sikazwe, Chisha T.; Chidlow, Glenys R.; Imrie, Allison; Smith, David W.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fd0dededc4ca7e5434b4008ed41f494bde09e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172306.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216896/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.05.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416300556; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416300556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assays","copies","RV-C cultivation","RV-C types","corresponding RV-C genotypes","Rhinovirus C","broad range of circulating RV-C genotypes","silico analysis of available RV-C sequences","linear dynamic range","quantification method","untranslated region","STUDY DESIGN","bp region","strong linear relationship","reverse transcription quantitative PCR","important respiratory pathogen of children","RT-qPCR","development","target sequence variation","nasopharyngeal aspirates","UTR","viral load","disease severity","NPAs","coefficients of variations lower","contribution","RESULTS","homology","BACKGROUND","Difficulty","amplification efficiency greater","OBJECTIVE","aim","Repeatability","reproducibility","orders of magnitude","limit of detection","Probes"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a third species, HRV-C, was categorized based on molecular typing studies. The results showed that the HRV-C genome had diverged from that of HRV-A and -B. Despite its late identification, increasing evidence suggests that HRV-C causes more severe pathogenic infections than HRV-A or -B; however, a large amount of epidemiological data is required to confirm this association in different clinical settings. Consequently, a simple and rapid method for identifying HRV-C is required to expedite such epidemiological studies. Here, two degenerate primer sets (HEV and HRVC) were designed based on bioinformatic analyses. The HEV set targeting the fifth IRES domain sequence within the 5\u2032-UTR, which is highly conserved among enteroviruses, was designed to detect all enteroviruses, whereas the HRVC set, which targeted the VP2 coding region, was designed to detect HRV-C alone. Both primer sets were tested against a panel of standard enteroviruses and clinical lavage samples. HEV detected all enteroviruses tested whereas HRVC was specific for HRV-C. Although the primer design strategy was confirmed with a limited number of samples, extensive tests are required to be applied in clinical settings.","publish_time":"2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nam, Young Ran; Lee, Uk; Choi, Han Seok; Lee, Kyoung Jin; Kim, Nari; Jang, Yong Ju; Joo, Chul Hyun","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/746e46b0df1d289d7ebd064e79eee49d4340a4ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113658.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414004406; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRVC","HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-C causes","HRV-C genome","HRVC set","HEV set","clinical lavage samples","panel of standard enteroviruses","degenerate primer sets","different clinical settings","epidemiological studies","primer design strategy","epidemiological data","severe pathogenic infections","limited number of samples","molecular typing studies","common cause of upper respiratory tract infections","evidence","extensive tests","IRES domain sequence","association","rapid method","VP2 coding region","Abstract Human rhinovirus","late identification","UTR","species","results","bioinformatic analyses"],"language":"en"},

This study reports the detection and genetic characterization of PAstV, PSaV in healthy and diarrheic domestic pigs and PEDV and TGEV in diarrheic pigs of different age groups. RESULTS: The presence of PAstV and PSaV was studied in 411 rectal swabs collected from healthy (n = 251) and diarrheic (n = 160) pigs of different age categories: suckling (n = 143), weaned (n = 147) and fattening (n = 121) animals on farms in Slovakia. The presence of TGEV and PEDV was investigated in the diarrheic pigs (n = 160). A high presence of PAstV infections was detected in both healthy (94.4%) and diarrheic (91.3%) pigs. PSaV was detected less often, but also equally in clinically healthy (8.4%) and diarrheic (10%) pigs. Neither TGEV nor PEDV was detected in any diarrheic sample. The phylogenetic analysis of a part of the RdRp region revealed the presence of all five lineages of PAstV in Slovakia (PAstV-1 \u2013 PAstV-5), with the most frequent lineages being PAstV-2 and PAstV-4. Analysis of partial capsid genome sequences of the PSaVs indicated that virus strains belonged to genogroup GIII. Most of the PSaV sequences from Slovakia clustered with sequences originating from neighbouring countries. CONCLUSIONS: Due to no significant difference between healthy and diarrheic pigs testing of the presence of PAstV and PSaV provides no diagnostic value. Genetic diversity of PAstV was very high as all five lineages were identified in pig farms in Slovakia. PSaV strains were genetically related to the strains circulating in Central European region.","publish_time":"2018-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salamunova, Slavomira; Jackova, Anna; Mandelik, Rene; Novotny, Jaroslav; Vlasakova, Michaela; Vilcek, Stefan","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df9b7b29b4b5a14245aea9cc707d52b732052a47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6194665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1640-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","TGEV"],"locations":["Slovakia"],"keyphrases":["lineages of PAstV","diarrheic domestic pigs","genetic characterization of PAstV","PSaV sequences","PSaV strains","high presence of PAstV infections","Genetic diversity of PAstV","presence of TGEV","diarrheic sample","PEDV","diarrheic pigs of different age groups","Slovakia","virus strains","pigs of different age categories","pig farms","pig farming","frequent lineages","characterization of pig enteric viruses","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Analysis of partial capsid genome sequences","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","RdRp region","phylogenetic analysis","Central European region","determination of economic impacts","PSaVs","animal health","risks","Surveillance","rotavirus","suckling","significant difference","agents","kobuvirus","detection","astrovirus","animals","sapovirus","rectal swabs","study","BACKGROUND","genogroup GIII","fattening","diagnostic value","neighbouring countries","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p\u003C0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7, O26:H11, O91:H21, O111:H2, O8, O127: H6, O86 and O128:H2. Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates on three toxin genes: heat-stable enterotoxin (sta), shiga toxin type 1 and 2 (stx1 and stx2) revealed two well-known pathotypes (EPEC O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7 and EHEC O26:H11 O91:H21 O111:H2) with high frequency of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Molecular analysis also showed a number of E. coli isolates that carry sta and stx1 or sta and stx2 gene and belonged to O8, and O127:H6, O86 and O128:H2. These isolates were identified as hybrid E. coli strains (ETEC-STEC) and found in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. In conclusion, the present study identified high frequency of pathogenic E. coli in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. Serological and molecular analysis of E. coli isolates showed that high frequency of EHEC and presence of a new phenotype, STEC\u2013ETEC hybrid, revealing their importance in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans.","publish_time":"2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aref, Nasr-Eldin M.; Abdel-Raheem, Abdel-Raheem A.; Kamaly, Hanaa F.; Hussien, Soher Z.","journal":"Open Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e222c3bbd05eb665b185124594a7d85712735418.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6203894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425958/; https://doi.org/10.4314/ovj.v8i4.1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["EHEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli isolates","diarrheic calves","coli strains","diarrheic neonatal calves","H7","positive isolates","H21 O111","high frequency of EHEC","high frequency of pathogenic","EHEC O26","ETEC hybrid","severe diarrhea","molecular analysis of","high frequency of enterohemorrhagic","H11 O91","H18","O55","O146","H4","O121","O113","H6","O127","stx1","O86","etiopathogenesis of diarrhea","ETEC-STEC","O128","present study","Molecular characterization of","Animals","various degree of diarrhea","toxin genes","EPEC O44","stx2 gene","severe cases","hematobiochemical consequences","shiga toxin type","presence of cardinal signs of dehydration","special reference","heat-stable enterotoxin","hyperkalemia","new phenotype","well-known pathotypes","uremia","O-H serotyping of cultural","hemogram parameters","bacteriological examinations","importance","role","reservoir","serotypes","number of","days","groups","conclusion","significant increase","age","humans"],"language":"en"},

FebriDx carries a CE mark for use in the EU and is also approved in several other countries, including Canada, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. It is indicated for use in patients \u003E 2 years old with symptoms consistent with a community-acquired ARI. The test involves the use of an immunoassay on a fingerstick blood sample to provide simultaneous, qualitative measurement of elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA). In two prospective, multicentre studies in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections, FebriDx was shown to be both sensitive and specific in identifying patients with a clinically significant infection and in differentiating between infections of bacterial and viral aetiology. The test is simple, requires no additional equipment and produces actionable results in ~ 10 min. As was demonstrated in a small, retrospective analysis, FebriDx results can help guide (improve) antibiotic prescribing decisions. Reducing the unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for ARIs of probable viral aetiology is important for antibiotic stewardship and can also reduce the unnecessary exposure of patients to the risk of antibiotic-related adverse events.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis on daily viral positive tests and daily ED visits and hospitalizations between 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2013 in Ontario, Canada. Viral data was collected from the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID). The Canadian Institute for Health Information reports daily ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, COPD and asthma as a primary diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 4,365,578 ED visits with RTIs of which 321,719 (7.4%) were admitted to hospital; 817,141 ED visits for COPD of which 260,665 (31.9%) were admitted and 649,666 ED visits with asthma of which 68,626 (10.6%) were admitted. The percentage of positive tests to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus prevalence explained 57.4% of ED visits and 63.8% of hospitalizations for RTI, 41.4% of ED visits and 39.2% of hospitalizations with COPD but only 1.5% of ED visits and 2.7% of hospitalizations for asthma. The further addition of human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus over the final 3 years accounted for 66.7% of ED visits and 74.4% of hospitalizations for RTI, 52.5% of visits and 48.2% of hospitalizations for COPD, and only 13.3% of visits and 10.4% of hospitalizations for asthma.

PEDV is mainly transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route. Transmission via the venereal route has been suspected but not previously investigated. The aim of the study was to determine if PEDV could be detected in semen from infected specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars inoculated with a PEDV US non-InDel strain suggesting venereal transmission may occur. Two boars orally inoculated with PEDV showed clinical signs and virus shedding in feces. Transient presence of the PEDV genome was detected by RT-qPCR in the seminal (5.06 \u00D7 10(2) to 2.44 \u00D7 10(3) genomic copies/mL) and sperm-rich fraction of semen (5.64 \u00D7 10(2) to 3.40 \u00D7 10(4) genomic copies/mL) and a longer duration of viral shedding was observed in the sperm-rich fraction.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Community-based recruitment of participants with colds. Prospective monitoring from within 48 hours of first symptom until 2 days after end of cold. The WURSS-44 includes 1 global illness severity item, 32 symptom-based items, 10 functional quality-of-life items, and 1 item assessing global change. The SF-36, SF-8, and the Jackson cold scale were used as external comparators. RESULTS: Participants included 104 women and 45 men, aged 18 to 80 years, self-reporting on 1,681 person-days of illness. Factor analysis suggested 10 dimensions, with reliability coefficients from 0.62 to 0.93. Comparing daily WURSS-44 to Jackson and SF-8 yielded Pearson correlation coefficients from 0.73 to 0.93, and from \u22120.60 to \u22120.84, respectively. Importance to patients and responsiveness assessment yielded a short version, the WURSS-21. Guyatt\u0027s responsiveness index was 0.54 for the SF-8, 0.61 for the Jackson, 0.71 for the WURSS-44, and 0.80 for the WURSS-21, suggesting that a two-armed trial would require 74 participants for the WURSS-21, 92 for the WURSS-44, 124 for the Jackson scale, and 156 for the SF-8. CONCLUSIONS: The construct validity of WURSS-44 is supported by measures of reliability, responsiveness, importance to patients, and convergence.

Here the distribution of glycoprotein bound 4-O-Acetylated sialic acids (4-O-Ac sias) in vertebrates was determined using a novel virus histochemistry assay. The 4-O-Ac sias were found in the circulatory system, i.e. on the surface of endothelial cells and RBCs, of several vertebrate species, though most frequently in the cartilaginous fish (class Chondrichthyes) and the bony fish (class Osteichthyes). The O-Acetylated sialic acid was detected in 64 % of the examined fish species. Even though the sialic acid was found less commonly in higher vertebrates, it was found at the same location in the positive species. The general significance of this endothelial labelling pattern distribution is discussed. The seemingly conserved local position through the evolution of the vertebrates, suggests an evolutionary advantage of this sialic acid modification.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belonging to gamma-coronaviruses, causes a highly infectious respiratory viral disease and can result in catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Unfortunately, the genetic basis of the host immune responses against IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, the antibody levels against IBV post-immunization were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 511 individuals from a commercial chicken (Gallus gallus) population. A genome-wide association study using 43,211 single nucleotide polymorphism markers was performed to identify the major loci affecting the immune response against IBV. This study detected 20 significant (P \u003C 1.16 \u00D7 10(\u22126)) effect single nucleotide polymorphisms for the antibody level against IBV. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were distributed on five chicken chromosomes (GGA), involving GGA1, GGA3, GGA5, GGA8, and GGA9. The genes in the 1-Mb windows surrounding each single nucleotide polymorphism with significant effect for the antibody level against IBV were associated with many biological processes or pathways related to immunity, such as the defense response and mTOR signaling pathway. A genomic region containing a cluster of 13 beta-defensin (GAL1\u201313) and interleukin-17F genes on GGA3 probably plays an important role in the immune response against IBV. In addition, the major loci significantly associated with the antibody level against IBV on GGA1 and GGA5 could explain about 12% and 13% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. This study suggested that the chicken genome has several important loci affecting the immune response against IBV, and increases our knowledge of how to control outbreaks of infectious bronchitis.","publish_time":"2013-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Chenglong; Qu, Hao; Ma, Jie; Wang, Jie; Hu, Xiaoxiang; Li, Ning; Shu, Dingming","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4939a8ffb831e245e793678ca58921a9cea68872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106259.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813004474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333371/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.12.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813004474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV post-immunization","effect single nucleotide polymorphisms","single nucleotide polymorphism markers","antibody levels","important loci","major loci","chicken genome","defense response","present study","commercial chicken","GGA3","significant effect","Gallus gallus","GGA1","host immune responses","chicken chromosomes","genome-wide association study","GGA5","outbreaks of infectious bronchitis","Infectious bronchitis virus","important role","infectious respiratory viral disease","F genes","gamma-coronaviruses","catastrophic economic losses","serum","immunity","individuals","Mb windows","severe diseases","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","cluster","poultry industry","hot research topic","interleukin","genetic basis","biological processes","GGA8","population","beta-defensin","GAL1","humans","animals","pathways","mTOR","genomic region","GGA9","addition","knowledge","phenotypic variation"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that PRV infection induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response, contributing to severe neuropathy in mice. So far, the mechanisms that initiate this neuroinflammation remain unknown. Using a mouse footpad inoculation model, we found that PRV infection rapidly and simultaneously induces high G-CSF and IL-6 levels in several mouse tissues, including the footpad, PNS and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Interestingly, this global increase occurred before PRV had replicated in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons and also was independent of systemic inflammation. These high G-CSF and IL-6 levels were not caused by neutrophil infiltration in PRV infected tissues, as we did not detect any neutrophils. Efficient PRV replication and spread in the footpad was sufficient to activate DRGs to produce cytokines. Finally, by using knockout mice, we demonstrated that TLR2 and IFN type I play crucial roles in modulating the early neuroinflammatory response and clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice. Overall, these results give new insights into the initiation of virus-induced neuroinflammation during herpesvirus infections.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laval, Kathlyn; Van Cleemput, Jolien; Vernejoul, Jonah B.; Enquist, Lynn W.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1275c64d711b3973f7e25ebc72bbc7c99341dd00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6824567.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRV infected tissues","clinical outcome of PRV infection","Efficient PRV replication","mouse tissues","initiation of virus","PNS","Pseudorabies virus","DRGs","levels","high G-CSF","knockout mice","mouse footpad inoculation model","central nervous system","peripheral nervous system","Varicella-Zoster virus","IFN type","induced neuroinflammation","early neuroinflammatory response","lethal inflammatory response","Herpes simplex type","neurons","crucial roles","VZV","mucosa epithelia","HSV1","TLR2","dorsal root ganglia","CNS","neutrophil infiltration","severe neuropathy","new insights","herpesvirus infections","alphaherpesvirus","results","independent of systemic inflammation","mechanisms","cytokines","host","global increase","neutrophils"],"language":"en"},

Food may be contaminated by virus during all stages of the food supply chain, and transmission can occur by consumption of food contaminated during the production process (primary production, or during further processing), or contaminated by infected food handlers. Transmission of zoonotic viruses (e.g. HEV) can also occur by consumption of products of animal origin. Viruses do not multiply in foods, but may persist for extended periods of time as infectious particles in the environment, or in foods.

The relative contribution of different sources (shellfish, fresh produce, food handler including asymptomatic shedders, food handling environment) to foodborne illness has not been determined. The Panel recommends focusing controls on preventive measures to avoid viral contamination rather than trying to remove/inactivate these viruses from food. Also, it is recommended to introduce a microbiological criteria for viruses in bivalve molluscs, unless they are labelled \u201Cto be cooked before consumption\u201D.

One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation. METHODS The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms. We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine. RESULTS The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included. Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care. CONCLUSION To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neubeck, Lis; Hansen, Tina; Jaarsma, Tiny; Klompstra, Leonie; Gallagher, Robyn","journal":"European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of Cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1474515120924530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["remote healthcare","COVID","cardiovascular disease","healthcare interventions","physical health","mental health","usual care","digital healthcare solutions","quarantine situation period","effects of quarantine","cardiovascular morbidity","quarantine search terms","people","physical well-being","physical activity","access","literature search","period of prolonged social isolation","acute situation","mHealth","adverse effect","Google Scholar","telehealth","mobile apps","PubMed","CINAHL","efforts","mortality","evidence","relevant publications","METHODS","workforce","reimbursement","overarching themes","review","attention","paper","illness","option","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","aim","articles"],"language":"en"},

Human coronavirus HKU1, first discovered in 2005, has a worldwide prevalence and is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease in both children and adults. Research on HCoV-HKU1 has been difficult because of its inability to be cultured on continuous cell lines and only recently it was isolated from clinical specimens using primary human, ciliated airway epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate that HCoV-HKU1 can infect and be serially propagated in primary human alveolar type II cells at the air-liquid interface. We were not able to infect alveolar type I-like cells or alveolar macrophages. Type II alveolar cells infected with HCoV-HKU1 demonstrated formation of large syncytium. At 72 hours post inoculation, HCoV-HKU1 infection of type II cells induced increased levels of mRNAs encoding IL29,CXCL10, CCL5, and IL-6 with no significant increases in the levels of IFN\u03B2. These studies demonstrate that type II cells are a target cell for HCoV-HKU1 infection in the lower respiratory tract, that type II alveolar cells are immune-competent in response to infection exhibiting a type III interferon and proinflammatory chemokine response, and that cell to cell spread may be a major factor for spread of infection. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that human alveolar cells can be used to isolate and study novel human respiratory viruses that cause lower respiratory tract disease.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dominguez, Samuel R.; Travanty, Emily A.; Qian, Zhaohui; Mason, Robert J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e6709b68cb7312fda8a1c5a2b2505d21a38a1e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3722178.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human alveolar cells","primary human alveolar type","primary human respiratory epithelial cells","HCoV-HKU1 infection of type","Human coronavirus HKU1","study of human respiratory viruses","respiratory pathogens","study novel human respiratory viruses","lower respiratory tract disease","target cell","cell spread","alveolar macrophages","ciliated airway epithelial cells","high degree of cell","continuous cell lines","studies","natural target","levels of IFN\u03B2","increased levels of mRNAs","proinflammatory chemokine response","isolation","system","immune-competent","CXCL10","IL29","tissue","interferon","children","clinical specimens","CCL5","significant increases","inability","major factor","inoculation","formation of large syncytium","air-liquid interface","host specificity","adults","hours","Research","worldwide prevalence"],"language":"en"},

Fueled by high mutation rates, mutants arise continually, and they change in relative frequency as viral replication proceeds. The term quasispecies was adopted from a theory of the origin of life in which primitive replicons) consisted of mutant distributions, as found experimentally with present day RNA viruses. The theory provided a new definition of wild type, and a conceptual framework for the interpretation of the adaptive potential of RNA viruses that contrasted with classical studies based on consensus sequences. Standard clonal analyses and deep sequencing methodologies have confirmed the presence of myriads of mutant genomes in viral populations, and their participation in adaptive processes. The quasispecies concept applies to any biological entity, but its impact is more evident when the genome size is limited and the mutation rate is high. This is the case of the RNA viruses, ubiquitous in our biosphere, and that comprise many important pathogens. In virology, quasispecies are defined as complex distributions of closely related variant genomes subjected to genetic variation, competition and selection, and that may act as a unit of selection. Despite being an integral part of their replication, high mutation rates have an upper limit compatible with inheritable information. Crossing such a limit leads to RNA virus extinction, a transition that is the basis of an antiviral design termed lethal mutagenesis.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban; Perales, Celia","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a40e0524650607a97d889ea3aa1a9cb990a3326b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6797082.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant genomes","mutant distributions","Viral quasispecies","mutant spectra","mutant swarms","mutant clouds","high mutation rates","adaptive potential of RNA viruses","quasispecies concept","term quasispecies","present day RNA viruses","viral populations","RNA virus extinction","viral replication proceeds","theory","large numbers of variant genomes","complex distributions","adaptive processes","unit of selection","upper limit compatible","deep sequencing methodologies","presence of myriads","Standard clonal analyses","interpretation","primitive replicons","classical studies","genetic variation","new definition of wild type","conceptual framework","population structure","antiviral design","impact","basis","origin of life","inheritable information","genome size","biological entity","transition","relative frequency","participation","competition","biosphere","lethal mutagenesis","consensus sequences","case","mutants","virology","important pathogens"],"language":"en"},

The coronavirus replication/transcription complex is an assembly of viral and, most probably, cellular proteins that mediate the synthesis of both the unusually large (\u223C30kb) RNA genome and an extensive set of subgenomic mRNAs. The viral components of the complex are encoded by the giant replicase gene, which is expressed in the form of two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are processed into 16 cleavage products (nonstructural proteins 1\u201316). Using the combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and GST pull-down assays, we have now analyzed all potential interactions between SARS-Coronavirus nonstructural proteins, which may contribute to the structure and/or function of the viral replication/transcription complex. We demonstrate the existence of a complex network of interactions involving all 16 nonstructural proteins.

There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of the immunology of this disease to contain the pandemic by developing vaccines and medicines for the prevention and treatment of patients. In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to detoriating clinical conditions such as, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute phase reactants and serum biochemistry in COVID-19. Similar to many other viral infections, asymptomatic disease is present in a significant but currently unknown fraction of the affected individuals.In the majority of the patients, a one-week, self-limiting viral respiratory disease typically occurs, which ends with the development of neutralizing anti-viral T cell and antibody immunity. The IgM, IgA and IgG type virus-specific antibodies levels are important measurements to predict population immunity against this disease and whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is taking place.High viral-load during the first infection and repeated exposure to virus especially in healthcare workers can be an important factor for severity of disease. It should be noted that many aspects of severe patients are unique to COVID-19 and are rarely observed in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia and lung tissue damage, a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Lymphopenia causes a defect in antiviral and immune regulatory immunity. At the same time, a cytokine storm starts with extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms both of with contribute to a poor prognosis. Elevated levels of acute phase reactants and lymphopenia are early predictors of high disease severity. Prevention of development to severe disease, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome and novel approachs to prevent their development will be main routes for future research areas. As we learn to live amidst the virus, understanding the immunology of the disease can assist in containing the pandemic and in developing vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat individual patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azkur, Ahmet Kursat; Akdis, M\u00FCbeccel; Azkur, Dilek; Sokolowska, Milena; van de Veen, Willem; Br\u00FCggen, Marie-Charlotte; O\u0027Mahony, Liam; Gao, Yadong; Nadeau, Kari; Akdis, Cezmi A","journal":"Allergy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396996/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14364","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe disease","severity of disease","asymptomatic disease","zoonotic disease","self-limiting viral respiratory disease","cytokine storm","acute respiratory distress syndrome","respiratory viral infections","eradication of coronavirus disease","early predictors of high disease severity","severe lymphopenia","aspects of severe patients","COVID","treatment of patients","individual patients","understanding","extensive activation of cytokine","High viral-load","Prevention of development","Elevated levels of acute phase reactants","immune regulatory immunity","anti-viral T cell","antibody immunity","immune response","population immunity","medicines","pandemic","developing vaccines","immunology","adaptive immune mechanisms","extensive pneumonia","immunopathological changes","IgG type virus-specific antibodies levels","important measurements","important factor","autopsy findings","secreting cells","lung tissue damage","eosinopenia","novel approachs","healthcare workers","wild animals","detoriating clinical conditions","serum biochemistry","main routes","repeated exposure","IgA","coronaviruses","place","defect","antiviral","multiorgan failure","week","unknown fraction","future research areas","affected individuals","IgM","cross-reactivity","majority","human beings","pressing need","time","poor prognosis","review"],"language":"en"},

Very recently, the natural compound silvestrol isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata was found to have very potent antiviral effects against the (\u2212)-strand RNA-virus Ebola virus as well as against Corona- and Picornaviruses with a (\u002B)-strand RNA-genome. This antiviral activity is based on the impaired translation of viral RNA by the inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eukaryotic initiation factor-4A (eIF4A) which is required to unwind structured 5\u00B4-untranslated regions (5\u2032-UTRs) of several proto-oncogenes and thereby facilitate their translation. Zika virus is a flavivirus with a positive-stranded RNA-genome harboring a 5\u2032-capped UTR with distinct secondary structure elements. Therefore, we investigated the effects of silvestrol on ZIKV replication in A549 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Two different ZIKV strains were used. In both infected A549 cells and primary human hepatocytes, silvestrol has the potential to exert a significant inhibition of ZIKV replication for both analyzed strains, even though the ancestor strain from Uganda is less sensitive to silvestrol. Our data might contribute to identify host factors involved in the control of ZIKV infection and help to develop antiviral concepts that can be used to treat a variety of viral infections without the risk of resistances because a host protein is targeted.","publish_time":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elgner, Fabian; Sabino, Catarina; Basic, Michael; Ploen, Daniela; Gr\u00FCnweller, Arnold; Hildt, Eberhard","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aea827ad6b4888677fad2702e41ef2b6d65e8141.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923443.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29584632/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10040149","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South America","Uganda"],"keyphrases":["strand RNA-virus Ebola virus","strand RNA-genome","effects of silvestrol","Zika virus","impaired translation of viral RNA","different ZIKV strains","significant inhibition of ZIKV replication","antiviral activity","antiviral concepts","control of ZIKV infection","potent antiviral effects","positive-stranded RNA-genome","primary human hepatocytes","new antiviral substances","natural compound silvestrol","infected A549 cells","variety of viral infections","DEAD-box RNA helicase eukaryotic initiation factor","host factors","host protein","unexpected outbreaks of emerging viral pathogens","need","specific pathogenic outcomes","broad-spectrum activities","capped UTR","South America","risk of resistances","distinct secondary structure elements","flavivirus","potential","plant Aglaia foveolata","ancestor strain","Uganda","untranslated regions","UTRs","Corona","eIF4A","proto-oncogenes","data","Picornaviruses"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that the virus uses heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment factors, facilitating viral entry into the cell. In the present study, we show that the membrane protein (M) of HCoV-NL63 mediates this attachment. Using viruslike particles lacking the spike (S) protein, we demonstrate that binding to the cell is not S protein dependent. Furthermore, we mapped the M protein site responsible for the interaction with HSPG and confirmed its relevance using a viable virus. Importantly, in silico analysis of the region responsible for HSPG binding in different clinical isolates and the Amsterdam I strain did not exhibit any signs of cell culture adaptation.

Here we show that the M protein is also an important player during early stages of HCoV-NL63 infection and that the concerted action of the two proteins (M and S) is a prerequisite for effective infection. We believe that this study broadens the understanding of HCoV-NL63 biology and may also alter the way in which we perceive the first steps of cell infection with the virus. The data presented here may also be important for future research into vaccine or drug development.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naskalska, Antonina; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Szczepanski, Artur; Milewska, Aleksandra; Jasik, Krzysztof Piotr; Pyrc, Krzysztof","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e97be91f6012204f532dc765a80baf6b2277d7f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6744225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315999/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00355-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/19/e00355-19.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSPG"],"locations":["Amsterdam"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63","NL63 infection","coronaviral S protein","S protein dependent","membrane protein","protein site responsible","NL63 biology","steps of cell infection","understanding of HCoV","viable virus","Human coronavirus NL63","region responsible","viral interaction","early stages of HCoV","HSPG binding","common respiratory virus","effective infection","signs of cell culture adaptation","viral entry","important player","present study","initial attachment factors","HSPGs","different clinical isolates","future research","vaccine","heparan sulfate proteoglycans","drug development","concerted action","relevance","spike","severe infections","silico analysis","cellular receptor","Amsterdam","viruslike particles","proteins","prerequisite","way","data","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

Viral dsRNA, produced during infections by both RNA and DNA viruses, activates OAS (a pathogen recognition receptor) resulting in production of 2-5A from ATP, which then activates RNase L leading to RNA cleavage. The factors that determine how cells limit activation of OAS-RNase L pathway to avoid tissue damage are poorly understood. Recently, we reported that the coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 accessory protein, ns2, blocks the RNase L pathway in macrophages and facilitates the development of hepatitis (Zhao et al., Cell Host \u0026 Microbe 11:607\u201316, 2012). The ns2 protein is a 2H phosphoesterase family member with two conserved His-x-Thr/Ser motifs that eliminates 2-5A, the activator of RNase L, through its 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase activity. Here we will show that cellular A-kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), another 2H phosphoesterase and homolog of ns2, has a similar enzymatic activity that degrades 2-5A. AKAP7 thus potentially provides the host cell with a mechanism for eliminating excess 2-5A and thus terminating RNase L activation. Accordingly, RNase L-mediated cleavage of rRNA in response to poly (rI):poly (rC) activation of OAS was suppressed by AKAP7 as determined in RNA chip analyses. In addition, cellular levels of active 2-5A were reduced by AKAP7 expression as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays for RNase L activation. These findings suggest that AKAP7 may be cytoprotective by preventing sustained activation of RNase L.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gusho, Elona; Jha, Babal K.; Zhang, Rong; Weiss, Susan R.; H.

During the age of vaccination, the introduction and successful application of vaccines against rinderpest and measles has led to the eradication of the former and the greater control of the latter.

Pathogenesis is promoted by reactive oxygen species accumulating at birth if counter-regulation is inadequate. The flavonol quercetin exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects that may enhance neonatal health. The aim of this work was to study effects of quercetin feeding on metabolic, antioxidative and inflammatory parameters in neonatal calves to investigate whether quercetin could compensate for insufficient colostrum supply. Twenty-eight newborn calves were assigned to two dietary groups fed colostrum or milk-based formula on day 1 and 2 and milk replacer thereafter. From day 2 onwards, 7 calves per diet group were additionally fed quercetin aglycone (50 mg/(kg body weight \u00D7 day)). Blood samples were taken repeatedly to measure plasma concentrations of flavonols, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, urea, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, haptoglobin and serum amyloid A. Trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity, ferric reducing ability of plasma, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and F2-isoprostanes were analyzed to evaluate plasma antioxidative status. Expression of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1\u03B1, interleukin-1\u03B2, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase mRNA were measured in liver tissue on day 8. Plasma flavonol concentrations were detectable only after quercetin-feeding without differences between colostrum and formula feeding. Plasma glucose, lactate, total protein, immunoglobulins, triglycerides, cholesterol, trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity and thiobarbituric acid reactive species were higher after colostrum feeding. Body temperature, fecal fluidity and plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin were higher in formula- than in colostrum-fed groups. Hepatic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor was higher after quercetin feeding and expression of C-reactive protein was higher after formula feeding. Data confirm that colostrum improves neonatal health and indicate that quercetin feeding cannot compensate for insufficient colostrum supply.","publish_time":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gruse, Jeannine; Kanitz, Ellen; Weitzel, Joachim M.; Tuchscherer, Armin; Stefaniak, Tadeusz; Jawor, Paulina; Wolffram, Siegfried; Hammon, Harald M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1771673809c10324fde2768ce37d548a5077577f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4709053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26752173/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146932","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

These models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of various control programs via vaccination and antiviral treatment. We use susceptible-, infectious-, recovered-type epidemic models consisting of ordinary differential equations. These models allow us to derive threshold conditions that can be used to assess the effectiveness of vaccine and drug use and to determine disease outcomes. Simulations are helpful for examining the potential consequences of control options under different scenarios. Particularly, results from models with constant parameters and models with time-dependent parameter functions are compared, demonstrating the significant differences in model outcomes. Results suggest that the effectiveness of vaccination and drug treatment can be very sensitive to factors including the time of introduction of the pathogen into the population, the beginning time of control programs, and the levels of control measures. More importantly, in some cases, the benefits of vaccination and antiviral use might be significantly compromised if these control programs are not designed appropriately. Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding the effects of various factors on the spread and control of infectious diseases. Particularly, the models can help identify potential adverse effects of vaccination and drug treatment in the case of pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2011-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Zhilan; Towers, Sherry; Yang, Yiding","journal":"The AAPS Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32d9bb3311052f30257c93eee30ebb1091cf92f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3160165.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1208/s12248-011-9284-7; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3160165?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["simple mathematical models","effectiveness of vaccination","effectiveness of various control programs","type epidemic models","beginning time of control programs","drug treatment","drug use","control of infectious diseases","levels of control measures","benefits of vaccination","potential consequences of control options","antiviral treatment","antiviral use","potential adverse effects of vaccination","effects of various factors","time of introduction","disease outcomes","effectiveness of vaccine","results","case of pandemic influenza","pandemic situation","time-dependent parameter functions","model outcomes","study of disease dynamics","spread","constant parameters","population","ordinary differential equations","different scenarios","pathogen","uses","significant differences","focus","Simulations","cases","threshold conditions","paper"],"language":"en"},

To develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus, we constructed Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins. Afterward, we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test (pNT) and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility. We tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sIPV vaccines by pNT and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests (cNT). A strong correlation was observed between two methods, with the correlation coefficients of all three types of IPV vaccines being greater than 0.82 (p \u003C 0.0001). The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) values obtained by pNT were approximately four times higher than that by cNT, revealing the better sensitivity of pNT.

RECENT FINDINGS: Important foodborne viruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A and rotavirus are usually \u201Conly\u201D contaminating food and are detected on the surface of foodstuffs. However, they are threats to human public health and make up for the majority of cases. In contrast, the meaning of viruses born from within the food such as natural animal and plant viruses is still in many cases unknown.

This RNA motif has high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) element, which is located at the 3\u2032 end of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins. The GAIT element is involved in the translation silencing of these mRNAs through its interaction with the GAIT complex (EPRS, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q, ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) to favor the resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, we showed that the viral RNA motif bound the GAIT complex and inhibited the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this RNA motif. To our knowledge, this is the first GAIT-like motif described in a positive RNA virus. To test the functional role of the GAIT-like RNA motif during TGEV infection, a recombinant coronavirus harboring mutations in this motif was engineered and characterized. Mutations of the GAIT-like RNA motif did not affect virus growth in cell cultures. However, an exacerbated innate immune response, mediated by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway, was observed in cells infected with the mutant virus compared with the response observed in cells infected with the parental virus. Furthermore, the mutant virus was more sensitive to beta interferon than the parental virus. All together, these data strongly suggested that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif modulates the host innate immune response.","publish_time":"2015-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marquez-Jurado, Silvia; Nogales, Aitor; Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c99640294d5862d4482de51f9a442deaf09b53be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4453530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00105-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","GAIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA motif","GAIT complex","viral GAIT","GAIT element","positive RNA virus","parental virus","mutant virus","virus growth","EPRS","translation silencing","end","mRNAs","exacerbated innate immune response","cells","mutations","arginyl-tRNA synthetase","gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation","beta interferon","recombinant coronavirus","TGEV infection","host proteins glutamyl-prolyl","proinflammatory proteins","transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q","ribosomal protein L13a","sequence","secondary structure","high homology","glyceraldehyde","melanoma differentiation-associated gene","interaction","MDA5","pathway","genome","chimeric mRNA","phosphate dehydrogenase","RRS","cell cultures","nucleotide","functional role","resolution of inflammation","data","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

All hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised/-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. These pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. Factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. Non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. The relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. For the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bing-Yuan,; Zhang, Yun-Hui; Leung, Nancy H.L.; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Yang, Zi-Feng","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/709e51c08788944db48106970f38cebe2b5bd596.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226118/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.11.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850217301404; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850217301404","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aerosol transmission of respiratory","aerosol route","increased risk of aerosol transmission","relative importance of aerosol transmission","enteric viruses","modes of transmission","nosocomial infections of respiratory","healthcare settings","physical properties of aerosol particles","risk of nosocomial viral infections","delineating transmission events","control of nosocomial infections","real-life settings","spillover infections","suppressed patients","effectiveness of systematic interventions","hospitals","presence of patients","hospital patients","particular risk of severe outcomes","particular challenge","increasing evidence","empirical evidence","medical procedures","indirect physical contact","individual-based interventions","recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols","droplets","vulnerable groups","children","older adults","difficulty","prolonged hospitalization","various microorganisms","on-going debate","infectivity","biological characteristics","host","outbreaks","diverse pathologies","death","susceptibility","environmental stresses","result","equipment","community","severity of disease","prevention","research","propensity","pathogens","temperature","humidity","Factors"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we demonstrated a dual role of YPFS in regulating cytokine release in cultured macrophages. In this study, we elucidated the anti-inflammatory effect of YPFS that is mediated through modulating the expression of three key enzymes involved in IBD: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IALP). In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic-inflammation model of cultured murine macrophages, YPFS treatment suppressed the activation of iNOS and COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, application of YPFS in cultured small intestinal enterocytes markedly induced the expression of IALP in a time-dependent manner, which might strengthen the intestinal detoxification system. A duality of YPFS in modulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 was determined here. The expression of iNOS and COX-2 in macrophages was induced by YPFS, and this activation was partially blocked by the NF-\u03BAB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082, indicating a role of NF-\u03BAB signaling. These YPFS-induced changes in gene regulation strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of YPFS are mediated through the regulation of inflammatory enzymes.","publish_time":"2014-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Crystal Y.

The use as antigens of either synthetic peptides (coupled to a carrier protein) or proteins expressed in Escherichia coli is described, and detailed protocols for immunization and preparation of test bleeds are provided. For screening of the immune response following immunization, detailed protocols for three commonly used techniques are described, all of which are based on the use of infected cells or cells expressing the protein of interest, side by side with appropriate controls. The in situ immunodetection of the target in fixed cells by immunofluorescence microscopy is described, as are protocols for techniques that can be applied to cell lysates containing the target protein (Western blotting and immunoprecipitation). The latter techniques are performed in combination with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus allowing confirmation of the molecular weight of the target that is recognized by the antiserum.","publish_time":"2007-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Wassenaar, Alfred L.

Plasma\u2010derived factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand Factor (VWF)/FVIII concentrates have been successfully used to treat haemophilia since the late 1960s. These products are derived from pools of plasma donations that may contain viral contaminants \u2013 including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \u2013 and may therefore present a transmission risk to recipients. To ensure the safety of Haemate(\u00AE) P/Humate\u2010P(\u00AE), a plasma\u2010derived VWF/FVIII concentrate, donors of plasma are carefully selected and all donations are screened for viral antigens (HBV), virus\u2010specific antibodies (HIV\u20101/2, HCV) and genomic material [hepatitis A virus, HBV, HCV, HIV\u20101 and high titres of human parvovirus B19 (B19V)]. As a quality control measure, plasma pools for fractionation are only released for further processing when non\u2010reactivity has been demonstrated in serological and genome amplification assays. The manufacturing process for plasma\u2010derived products, especially the fundamental procedure of pasteurization, is effective in inactivating and/or removing a wide variety of viruses that may potentially be present despite the screening process. This has been demonstrated in virus validation studies using a range of different viruses. New emerging infectious agents, including prions, which potentially pose a threat to recipients of plasma derivatives, are also the subject of safety evaluations. The multiple precautionary measures that are inherent in the overall production process of Haemate P/Humate\u2010P have resulted in an excellent safety record, documented during 25 years of clinical use, and will help to maintain the high safety margin in the future.","publish_time":"2008-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"GR\u00D6NER, A.","journal":"Haemophilia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf46a1bb1852c5f76bcb0098821f2c952e8902bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165962.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18786011/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01852.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["P/Humate\u2010P","Haemate P/Humate\u2010P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma pools","donors of plasma","pools of plasma donations","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","recipients of plasma derivatives","human immunodeficiency virus","HBV","HCV","HIV","derived VWF","derived products","derived factor","safety of Haemate","virus validation studies","high safety margin","overall production process of Haemate P","FVIII concentrates","manufacturing process","Humate","screening process","excellent safety record","subject of safety evaluations","viral contaminants","viral antigens","Willebrand Factor","high titres of human parvovirus B19","range of different viruses","wide variety of viruses","prions","fractionation","fundamental procedure of pasteurization","quality control measure","specific antibodies","genomic material","New emerging infectious agents","B19V","threat","multiple precautionary measures","genome amplification assays","non\u2010reactivity","inactivating","processing","future","years of clinical use","transmission risk","haemophilia","Summary"],"language":"en"},

The virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects. In this study, a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed, and its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were immunized initially by intramuscular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intranasal application. Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY). RESULTS: S1 protein expression was only detected by IHC in the kidneys of the Ad-MERS-S1 group at week 6 from first immunization, and in both lungs and kidneys of Ad-MERS-S1 group by conventional PCR at weeks 3 and 5 post-prime. The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization. There was a significant increase in the amount of Th1-related cytokines (interferon-\u03B3 and interleukin [IL] 12), and a significant decrease in the Th2-related cytokine IL-4 in splenocyte cell culture of the vaccinated group compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that this recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. This study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and/or prevention of MERS-CoV infection in humans.","publish_time":"2019-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ababneh, Mustafa; Alrwashdeh, Mu\u2019men; Khalifeh, Mohammad","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c9db7ee30074667f9fe308de9910b013aa1f163.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6868266.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.1554-1562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHC"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-S1 group","S1 subunit of MERS","S1 protein expression","Ad-MERS","weeks","MERS-CoV genome","prevention of MERS","specific regions","cellular immune responses","specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response","vaccinated mice","study","protective antigen-specific humoral","vaccinated group","kidneys of Ad","CoV infection","promising vaccine","recombinant adenovirus vaccine","conventional PCR","recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine","IHC","lungs","significant decrease","significant increase","RESULTS","immunization","splenocyte cell culture","Th2-related cytokine IL","control groups","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","significant global public health threat","Th1-related cytokines","conventional polymerase chain reaction","AIM","immunohistochemistry","interferon-\u03B3","spike","mer epitope","serum","devastating effects","interleukin","BACKGROUND","stimulation","intramuscular injection","CYSSLILDY","humans","sera","post-prime","MATERIALS","METHODS","intranasal application","discovery","CONCLUSION","onset","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected.

It is recognized as a serious problem in Plasmodium falciparum\u2013endemic sub-Saharan Africa, where recent data suggests that it is more common than previously believed. In such regions where malaria transmission is high, neonates may be protected from disease caused by congenital malaria through the transfer of maternal antibodies against the parasite. However, in low P. vivax\u2013endemic regions, immunity to vivax malaria is low; thus, there is the likelihood that congenital vivax malaria poses a more significant threat to newborn health. Malaria had previously been a major parasitic disease in China, and congenital malaria case reports in Chinese offer valuable information for understanding the risks posed by congenital malaria to neonatal health. As most of the literature documenting congenital malaria cases in China are written in Chinese and therefore are not easily accessible to the global malaria research community, we have undertaken an extensive review of the Chinese literature on this subject. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we reviewed congenital malaria cases from three major searchable Chinese journal databases, concentrating on data from 1915 through 2011. Following extensive screening, a total of 104 cases of congenital malaria were identified. These cases were distributed mainly in the eastern, central, and southern regions of China, as well as in the low-lying region of southwest China. The dominant species was P. vivax (92.50%), reflecting the malaria parasite species distribution in China. The leading clinical presentation was fever, and other clinical presentations were anaemia, jaundice, paleness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and general weakness. With the exception of two cases, all patients were cured with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, quinine, artemether, and artesunate. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of congenital malaria vary significantly between cases, so clear and early diagnosis is difficult. We suggest that active surveillance might be necessary for neonates born to mothers with a history of malaria.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Zhi-yong; Fang, Qiang; Liu, Xue; Culleton, Richard; Tao, Li; Xia, Hui; Gao, Qi","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5da136317f5b97ed8371d5121d8828f1c9a5372d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3953009.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626148/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002622","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cases of congenital malaria","congenital vivax malaria","symptoms of congenital malaria","malaria transmission","malaria parasites","history of malaria","malaria-endemic regions","congenital malaria case reports","literature documenting congenital malaria cases","malaria parasite species distribution","global malaria research community","southern regions of China","Chinese literature","neonates","low rates","low-lying region of southwest China","major searchable Chinese journal databases","endemic sub-Saharan Africa","major parasitic disease","clinical presentations","recent data","neonatal health","extensive screening","newborn health","extensive review","dominant species","leading clinical presentation","Plasmodium falciparum","immunity","valuable information","significant threat","quinine","diarrhoea","anaemia","jaundice","fever","risks","total","serious problem","transfer of maternal antibodies","chloroquine","antimalarial drugs","paleness","patients","early diagnosis","mothers","infants","life-threatening condition","artemether","birth","active surveillance","ABSTRACT","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","likelihood","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODS","general weakness","artesunate","exception","subject"],"language":"en"},

Influenza, which causes direct viral effects, or secondary bacterial complications is the most likely cause of an epidemic or pandemic where AMR may be a problem. We discuss other possible causes of a pandemic with AMR, and present a risk assessment formula to estimate the impact of AMR during a pandemic. Finally, we flag the potential impact of genetic engineering of pathogens on global risk and how this could radically change the epidemiology of AMR as we know it.

Hekou, a Chinese county on the China\u2013Vietnam border, was used to document Chinese experiences and lessons for malaria control and elimination. METHODS: The design was an ecological study. Malaria burden before 1951 and procedures of 64 years (1952\u20132015) from malaria hyperendemicity to elimination are described. Single and bilinear regression analysis was utilized to analyse the relationship between the annual malaria incidence (AMI) and gross domestic product (GDP), urbanization rate, and banana planting area (BPA). RESULTS: There was a huge malaria burden before 1951. AMI was reduced from 358.62 per 1000 person-years in 1953 to 5.69 per 1000 person-years in 1960. A system of primary health services, comprising three levels of county township hospitals and village health stations maintained malaria control and surveillance activities in changing political and social-economic settings. However, potential under-reported of malaria and market-oriented healthcare led to a malaria epidemic in 1987. Strong political commitment reoriented malaria from a control to an elimination programme. High coverage of malaria intervention and population access to intervention was crucial for malaria control and elimination; meanwhile, AMI was closely associated with socio-economic development, correlation coefficients (R) \u22120.6845 (95% CI \u22120.7978, \u22120.6845) for national GDP, \u22120.7014 (\u22120.8093, \u22120.7014) for national urbanization rate and \u22120.5563 (\u22120.7147, \u22120.3437) for BPA. CONCLUSIONS: Multifactor, including political commitment, effective interventions, social and economic development and changing ecological environment, and the complicated interactions between these factors contribute to malaria elimination in Hekou County.

In this study, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated as 6D10 and 4F10, which were directed against the N protein of IBV using the whole viral particles as immunogens. Both of the mAbs do not cross react with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and subtype H9 avian influenza virus (AIV). After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 6D10 and 4F10, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 242FGPRTK247 and 195DLIARAAKI203, respectively, in the IBV N protein. Alignments of amino acid sequences from a large number of IBV isolates indicated that the two epitopes, especially 242FGPRTK247, were well conserved among IBV strains. This conclusion was further confirmed by the relationships of 18 heterologous sequences to the 2 mAbs.

In this study, we show the ability of host cell novel miR-36 to specifically inhibit KSHV-induced expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) to limit virus infection of cells. Transfecting cells with miR-36 mimic specifically lowered IFITM1 expression and thereby significantly dampening KSHV infection. In contrast, inhibition of miR-36 using miR-36 inhibitor had the direct opposite effect on KSHV infection of cells, allowing enhanced viral infection of cells. The effect of miR-36 on KSHV infection of cells was at a post-binding stage of virus entry. The highlight of this work was in deciphering a common theme in the ability of miR-36 to regulate infection of closely related DNA viruses: KSHV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplexvirus-2 (HSV-2).

In recent decades, Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HKHA) has been making efforts to improve the healthcare services, but there still exist some problems like unfair resource allocation and poor management, as reported by the Hong Kong medical legislative committee. One critical consequence of these problems is low healthcare efficiency of hospitals, leading to low satisfaction among patients. Moreover, HKHA also suffers from the conflict between limited resource and growing demand. An effective evaluation of HA is important for resource planning and healthcare decision making. In this paper, we propose a two-phase method to evaluate HA efficiency for reducing healthcare expenditure and improving healthcare service. Specifically, in Phase I, we measure the HKHA efficiency changes from 2000 to 2013 by applying a novel DEA-Malmquist index with undesirable factors. In Phase II, we further explore the impact of some exogenous factors (e.g., population density) on HKHA efficiency by Tobit regression model. Empirical results show that there are significant differences between the efficiencies of different hospitals and clusters. In particular, it is found that the public hospital serving in a richer district has a relatively lower efficiency. To a certain extent, this reflects the socioeconomic reality in HK that people with better economic condition prefers receiving higher quality service from the private hospitals.","publish_time":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Hainan; Zhao, Yang; Niu, Tie; Tsui, Kwok-Leung","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2813c4975ae511e8e156daa2c5d81cb93bdcc05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5590922.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Hospital Authority","Hong Kong Hospital Authority","HKHA","HA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["low healthcare efficiency of hospitals","HKHA efficiency changes","public hospitals","healthcare expenditure","lower efficiency","healthcare services","Hong Kong Hospital Authority","healthcare decision making","private hospitals","resource planning","limited resource","efficiencies of different hospitals","problems","Hong Kong medical legislative committee","unfair resource allocation","effective evaluation of HA","undesirable factors","low satisfaction","exogenous factors","higher quality service","better economic condition","people","population density","significant differences","socioeconomic reality","poor management","conflict","richer district","recent decades","novel DEA-Malmquist index","institutes","statutory body","Tobit regression model","growing demand","two-phase method","critical consequence","clusters","efforts","Empirical results","certain extent","paper","impact","patients"],"language":"en"},

Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP. This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd-level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level. It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding. It also used available data on FCA and 305-d FLP at both cow and herd level. The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd-level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis. The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning. The median FLP was associated with median FCA and vaccination status for bovine respiratory syncytial virus. The association between FCA and FLP (based on 8,454 heifers) was analyzed with a single-effect linear mixed model, where the dependent variable was either FCA or relative FCA (defined as the difference between FCA of the heifer and median FCA of the herd to which they belonged). Heifers having an FCA of 24mo produced, on average, 7,164kg of milk per 305d, and calving 1mo earlier gave 143kg less milk per 305d. When FCA did not deviate from the median herd FCA, heifers produced, on average, 7,272kg of milk per 305d. From the median FCA of the herd, heifers calving 1mo earlier produced 90kg of milk per 305d less, and heifers calving 1mo later produced 86kg per 305d more. This is the first study that explained FLP using relative FCA. It assumes that heifers raised within the same farm have similar development because they are similarly managed. Similar management is reflected by the median FCA of the herd, with a deviation of the heifer\u2019s FCA from median FCA reflecting the heifer\u2019s development relative to the herd\u2019s average. The advantage of using relative FCA was that it accounts for between-farm differences in rearing management. It showed that earlier insemination without adjusting management to ensure sufficient development lowers FLP. An economic optimum exists between rearing costs, FCA, and FLP and, as a consequence, decisions with regard to young stock management should be made with care.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohd Nor, N.; Steeneveld, W.; van Werven, T.; Mourits, M.C.M.; Hogeveen, H.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9fac368ec82c6b23191deb4c644842b9aaadac0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219115/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030212008855; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030212008855; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5741","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FLP","FCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["median FCA","median herd FCA","relative FCA","heifer\u2019s FCA","Reduced FCA","median FLP","d FLP","herd level","lower FLP","heifers","rearing management variables","herd-level health","Similar management","general management","management factors","waste milk","sufficient development lowers FLP","young stock management","lactation milk production","heifer\u2019s development relative","rearing costs","cow level","calving age","similar development","earlier insemination","herd\u2019s average","study","minimum age","farm differences","available data","vaccination status","colostrum","dependent variable","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","Dutch dairy farms","single-effect linear mixed model","housing","decisions","regard","healthcare","disease","survey","cleanliness","consequence","multivariate regression analysis","deviation","associations","economic optimum","breeding","advantage","Abstract Farmers","preweaning"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, public health emergencies such as avian influenza, drug-resistant malaria, and Ebola have brought renewed attention to the need for effective communication channels between health authorities, particularly in regional contexts where neighbouring countries share common health threats. However, little empirical research has been conducted to date to explore the range of factors that may affect the transfer, exchange, and use of public health data and expertise across borders, especially in developing contexts. METHODS: To explore these issues, 60 interviews were conducted with domestic and international stakeholders in Cambodia and Vietnam, selected amongst those who were involved in regional public health programmes and networks. Data analysis was structured around three categories mapped across the dataset: (1) the nature of shared data and information; (2) the nature of communication channels; and (3) how information flow may be affected by the local, regional, and global system of rules and arrangements. RESULTS: There has been a great intensification in the circulation of data, information, and expertise across borders in Southeast Asia. However, findings from this study document ways in which the movement of data and information from production sites to other places can be challenging due to different standards and practices, language barriers, different national structures and rules that govern the circulation of health information inside and outside countries, imbalances in capacities and power, and sustainability of financing arrangements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the complex socio-technical nature of data and information sharing, suggesting that best practices require significant involvement of an independent third-party brokering organisation or office, which can redress imbalances between country partners at different levels in the data sharing process, create meaningful communication channels and make the most of shared information and data sets.","publish_time":"2018-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liverani, Marco; Teng, Srey; Le, Minh Sat; Coker, Richard","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/513f57a7efa430c143b840c17beb62c010429aac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6162912.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cambodia","Vietnam","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["public health data","circulation of data","information sharing","circulation of health information","movement of data","importance of data","data sets","Data analysis","shared information","nature of shared data","information flow","data sharing process","health authorities","public health emergencies","regional public health programmes","complex socio-technical nature of data","nature of communication channels","common health threats","regional contexts","effective communication channels","meaningful communication channels","different levels","different standards","imbalances","borders","expertise","different national structures","neighbouring countries","outside countries","best practices","developing contexts","global system of rules","study document ways","sustainability of financing arrangements","language barriers","avian influenza","significant involvement","independent third-party brokering organisation","power","need","drug-resistant malaria","Ebola","renewed attention","office","capacities","prevention","international stakeholders","country partners","production sites","date","Cambodia","recent years","places","networks","great intensification","control of infectious diseases","interviews","Vietnam","findings","Southeast Asia","categories","exchange","little empirical research","range of factors","issues","transfer","CONCLUSIONS","dataset","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs. And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Mengmeng; Chen, Liang; Zhang, Jingxiao; Xiong, Chenglong; Li, Xiangjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f6290c40d711d555eaa3a0a8644d825b6e2deb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161957.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","maternal-fetal interface cells","series fetal","cell specific expression of ACE2","receptor of SARS","specific cell types of human fetal heart","multiple fetal organs","specific cell types of maternal","person transmission characteristics","capacity of vertical transmission","stromal cells","human infections","present study","post-natal mouse lung","perivascular cells of decidua","post-natal day","online available single-cell RNA sequencing","apparent person","placenta dysfunction","scRNA-seq","data","neonatal mice","essential roles","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","liver","abortion","global public health concern","world","new type of pneumonia","time","Angiotensin","enzyme","clinical practice","kidney","summary","results"],"language":"en"},

To this aim, we designed, through a bioinformatic approach, 8 potentially immunogenic peptides from the protein N corresponding to sequences of residues 14, 182, 198 detected only in FCoVs from FIP cats (virulent strains), only in FCoVs from healthy cats (avirulent strains) and both in FIP and in healthy cats (mixed strains). The peptides or a sham solution were incubated with whole blood from 16 cats (7 healthy and 9 with chronic diseases other than FIP) and IFN-\u03B3 concentration was measured on plasma using an ELISA system. RT-PCR expression of IFN-\u03B3 mRNA was also evaluated after incubation of the peptides or a sham solution with whole blood from 4 clinically healthy cats.

Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins restrict membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. IFITM1 profoundly suppressed syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion induced by almost all viral fusion proteins examined; IFITM2 and IFITM3 also strongly inhibited their fusion, with efficiency somewhat dependent on cell types. Furthermore, treatment of cells with IFN also markedly inhibited viral membrane fusion and entry. By using the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope and influenza A virus hemagglutinin as models for study, we showed that IFITM-mediated restriction on membrane fusion is not at the steps of receptor- and/or low pH-mediated triggering; instead, the creation of hemifusion was essentially blocked by IFITMs. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a chemical known to promote the transition from hemifusion to full fusion, was unable to rescue the IFITM-mediated restriction on fusion. In contrast, oleic acid (OA), a lipid analog that generates negative spontaneous curvature and thereby promotes hemifusion, virtually overcame the restriction. To explore the possible effect of IFITM proteins on membrane molecular order and fluidity, we performed fluorescence labeling with Laurdan, in conjunction with two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We observed that the generalized polarizations (GPs) and fluorescence lifetimes of cell membranes expressing IFITM proteins were greatly enhanced, indicating higher molecularly ordered and less fluidized membranes. Collectively, our data demonstrated that IFITM proteins suppress viral membrane fusion before the creation of hemifusion, and suggested that they may do so by reducing membrane fluidity and conferring a positive spontaneous curvature in the outer leaflets of cell membranes. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of how IFITM protein family restricts viral membrane fusion and infection.","publish_time":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Kun; Markosyan, Ruben M.; Zheng, Yi-Min; Golfetto, Ottavia; Bungart, Brittani; Li, Minghua; Ding, Shilei; He, Yuxian; Liang, Chen; Lee, James C.; Gratton, Enrico; Cohen, Fredric S.; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e11e3105842cf7cedf10e26bff170a52c23cf00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3554583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23358889/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral fusion proteins","cell-cell fusion","classes of viral membrane fusion proteins","membrane fluidity","IFITM-mediated restriction","IFITM protein family","possible effect of IFITM proteins","membrane molecular order","fluorescence lifetimes of cell membranes","cell types","creation of hemifusion","outer leaflets of cell membranes","early stages of viral replication","study","fluidized membranes","positive spontaneous curvature","negative spontaneous curvature","new class of cellular restriction factors","fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy","low pH-mediated triggering","influenza","virus hemagglutinin","photon laser scanning","understanding","lipid analog","suppressed syncytia formation","Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope","OA","conjunction","GPs","IFN","representatives","interferon-inducible transmembrane","models","FLIM","IFITM1","efficiency","IFITM2","IFITM3","infection","evidence","oleic acid","generalized polarizations","novel insight","underlying mechanism","chemical","contrast","steps of receptor","transition","data","entry","treatment of cells","Chlorpromazine","CPZ","Laurdan","IFITMs"],"language":"en"},

Only recently have platelets\u2014long considered merely effectors of thrombosis\u2014been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that still plague the care of these high-risk individuals. An understanding of the role of platelets in critical illness also highlights the potential for both the development of risk stratification schema and the use of novel, targeted therapies that might alter the natural history of sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS.

Enhanced CNS PD\u20101 and PD\u2010L1 expression has been documented in inflammatory murine models; however, human CNS data are still incomplete. We determined that human primary cultures of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, or neurons expressed low or undetectable PD\u2010L1 under basal conditions, but inflammatory cytokines significantly induced such expression, especially on astrocytes and microglia. Blocking PD\u2010L1 expression in astrocytes using specific siRNA led to significantly increased CD8 T\u2010cell responses (proliferation, cytokines, lytic enzyme). Thus, our results establish that inflamed human glial cells can express sufficient and functional PD\u2010L1 to inhibit CD8 T cell responses. Extensive immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem brain tissues demonstrated a significantly greater PD\u2010L1 expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions compared with control tissues, which colocalized with astrocyte or microglia/macrophage cell markers. However, more than half of infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions did not express PD\u20101, the cognate receptor. Thus, our results demonstrate that inflamed human CNS cells such as in MS lesions express significantly elevated PD\u2010L1, providing a means to reduce CD8 T cell responses, but most of these infiltrating immune cells are devoid of PD\u20101 and thus insensitive to PD\u2010L1/L2.

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03B3), we estimated R 0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96\u20132.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89\u20134.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate.

It has long been recognized that type I IFNs can potently block HIV-1 replication in vitro; as such, HIV-1 has been used as a system to identify and characterize IFN-induced antiviral proteins responsible for this block. IFN-induced HERC5 contains an amino-terminal Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1)-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus (HECT) domain. HERC5 is the main cellular E3 ligase that conjugates the IFN-induced protein ISG15 to proteins. This E3 ligase activity was previously shown to inhibit the replication of evolutionarily diverse viruses, including HIV-1. The contribution of the RCC1-like domain to the antiviral activity of HERC5 was previously unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 particle production by a second distinct mechanism that targets the nuclear export of Rev/RRE-dependent RNA. Unexpectedly, the E3 ligase activity of HERC5 was not required for this inhibition. Instead, this activity required the amino-terminal RCC1-like domain of HERC5. Inhibition correlated with a reduction in intracellular RanGTP protein levels and/or the ability of RanGTP to interact with RanBP1. Inhibition also correlated with altered subcellular localization of HIV-1 Rev. In addition, we demonstrated that positive evolutionary selection is operating on HERC5. We identified a region in the RCC1-like domain that exhibits an exceptionally high probability of having evolved under positive selection and showed that this region is required for HERC5-mediated inhibition of nuclear export. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a second distinct mechanism by which HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 replication and demonstrate that HERC5 is evolving under strong positive selection. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that HERC5 is a novel host restriction factor.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woods, Matthew William; Tong, Jessica Gayle; Tom, Sean Kevin; Szabo, Peter Anthony; Cavanagh, Peter Craig; Dikeakos, Jimmy Dimitrios; Haeryfar, SM Mansour; Barr, Stephen Dominic","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d65ef4b00759d797d28454625b4de2814675bb56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4021598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693865/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-11-27","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chromosome Condensation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domain of HERC5","IFN-induced HERC5","antiviral activity of HERC5","E3 ligase activity of HERC5","HERC5-mediated inhibition of nuclear export","amino-terminal RCC1","IFN-induced protein ISG15","virus replication","positive evolutionary selection","strong positive selection","altered subcellular localization of HIV","carboxyl-terminal Homologous","antiviral proteins responsible","distinct mechanism","main cellular E3 ligase","region","Type","block","nuclear export of Rev","multiple antiviral mechanisms","amino-terminal Regulator of Chromosome Condensation","intracellular RanGTP protein levels","ability of RanGTP","E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus","HECT","reduction","interferon","particle production","novel host restriction factor","RRE-dependent RNA","growing body of evidence","high probability","pathways","BACKGROUND","addition","diverse viruses","findings","RanBP1","study","IFNs","contribution","RESULTS","system","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

I sketch a deontological framework for assessing when it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work to protect their families from infection and when it is a dereliction of duty to patients. I argue that it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work when their duty to treat is outweighed by the combined risks and burdens of that work. For HCWs who live with their families, the obligation to protect one\u2019s family from infection contributes significantly to those burdens. There are, however, a range of complicating factors including the strength of duty to treat which varies according to the HCW\u2019s role, the vulnerability of family members to the disease, the willingness of family members to risk infection and the resources available to the HCW to protect their family. In many cases, HCWs in \u2018frontline\u2019 roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work given the risks posed by COVID-19; therefore, society should provide additional incentives to maintain sufficient staff in these roles.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"McConnell, Doug","journal":"J Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13119e7e26f1a1c0e62445a9224ea8bc8a4a815d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32332154/; https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCWs","families","infection","strength of duty","weak duty","dereliction of duty","vulnerability of family members","willingness of family members","COVID","roles","burdens","sufficient staff","sufficient workforce","healthcare workers","Healthcare systems","combined risks","disease","frontline","adequate care","additional incentives","range of complicating factors","resources available","HCW\u2019s role","society","world","obligation","Staffing problems","pandemic","patients","cases","home","deontological framework","concern"],"language":"en"},

In many cases (but not always), the viruses have evolved to bind the PDZ domains using the same short linear peptide motifs found in host protein-PDZ interactions, and in some cases regulate the interactions in a similar fashion by phosphorylation. What is striking is that the diverse viruses target a common subset of PDZ proteins that are intimately involved in controlling cell polarity and the structure and function of intercellular junctions, including tight junctions. Cell polarity is fundamental to the control of cell proliferation and cell survival and disruption of polarity and the signal transduction pathways involved is a key event in tumourigenesis. This review focuses on the oncogenic viruses and the role of targeting PDZ proteins in the virus life cycle and the contribution of virus-PDZ protein interactions to virus-mediated oncogenesis. We highlight how many of the viral associations with PDZ proteins lead to deregulation of PI3K/AKT signalling, benefitting virus replication but as a consequence also contributing to oncogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Claire D.; Roberts, Sally","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5df6b1ce03de2b78801de3d8e20a50b3563a2cf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4810129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26797638/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens5010008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDZ","PI3K/AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDZ protein interactions","PDZ domains","human viruses","cell polarity","human immunodeficiency virus","contribution of virus","virus replication","host protein-PDZ interactions","role of targeting PDZ proteins","common subset of PDZ proteins","human T cell leukaemia virus type","virus-mediated oncogenesis","cell survival","oncogenic viruses","virus life cycle","cellular proteins","diverse viruses","control of cell proliferation","high-risk human papillomaviruses","disruption of polarity","cases","natural host","adenovirus type","oncogenic capabilities","tight junctions","function of intercellular junctions","Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus","hepatitis B","short linear peptide motifs","experimental systems","deregulation of PI3K","signal transduction pathways","ability","PSD95","AKT signalling","ZO","DLG","structure","key event","limited genome","similar fashion","viral associations","phosphorylation","consequence","interaction modules","tumourigenesis","review"],"language":"en"},

Measurements were collected for each disease for nine criteria that described potential disease impacts. A total score was calculated for each disease using a weighted sum value function that aggregated the nine disease criterion measurements and weights of importance for the criteria that were previously elicited from two groups of industry stakeholders. One stakeholder group placed most value on the impacts of disease on livestock, and one group placed more value on the zoonotic impacts of diseases. Prioritisation lists ordered by disease score were produced for both of these groups. Vesicular diseases were found to have the highest priority for the group valuing disease impacts on livestock, followed by acute forms of African and classical swine fever, then highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The group who valued zoonotic disease impacts prioritised rabies, followed by Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Nipah virus, interspersed with vesicular diseases. The multi-criteria framework used in this study systematically prioritised diseases using a multi-attribute theory based technique that provided transparency and repeatability in the process. Flexibility of the framework was demonstrated by aggregating the criterion weights from more than one stakeholder group with the disease measurements for the criteria. This technique allowed industry stakeholders to be active in resource allocation for their industry without the need to be disease experts. We believe it is the first prioritisation of livestock diseases using values provided by industry stakeholders. The prioritisation lists will be used by industry stakeholders to identify diseases for further risk analysis and disease spread modelling to understand biosecurity risks to this industry.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brookes, V.

One approach to delineating the molecular pathways of IFN efficacy is through the use of gene expression profiling technologies. In this proof-of-concept study, different (0, 50, 200 and 800 units) oral doses of natural bovine IFN (type I) were tested in cattle to determine if oral IFN altered the expression of genes that may be pivotal to the development of systemic resistance to viral infections such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Oral IFN was administered twice: Time 0 and 8 h later. Blood was collected at 0, 8 and 24 h after the first IFN administration, and DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was employed in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) microarray assays. Within 8 h, 50 and 200 units of oral IFN induced significant (P \u003C 0.05) changes in expression of 41 of 92 tested autoimmune and inflammatory response-associated genes. These data suggest that orally administered IFN is a viable approach for providing short-term antiviral immunity to livestock exposed to viruses such as FMD virus (FMDV) until such a time that an effective vaccine can be produced and distributed to producers.","publish_time":"2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mamber, Stephen W.; Lins, Jeremy; Gurel, Volkan; Hutcheson, David P.; Pinedo, Pablo; Bechtol, David; Krakowka, Steven; Fields-Henderson, Rachel; Cummins, Joseph M.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc20cb1e5d0f043be21202d9b13f2a604f508651.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173013.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300319; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27032505/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300319","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","FMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["administered IFN","units of oral IFN","IFN administration","oral doses of natural bovine IFN","molecular pathways of IFN efficacy","expression of genes","Time","bovine interferon","viable approach","efficacy profiles","FMD virus","use of gene expression profiling technologies","inflammatory response-associated genes","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","qPCR","viruses","PBMCs","DNA","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","short-term antiviral immunity","development of systemic resistance","foot","viral infections","livestock","type","microarray assays","FMDV","alpha","concept study","clinical benefits","mouth disease","changes","cattle","proof","mechanism","effective vaccine","safety","data","producers"],"language":"en"},

Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the Coronaviridae family have no discernable homology, but they share a common nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern. There are three putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs present in the N. To determine the role of these putative NLSs in the intracellular localization of the SARS\u2013CoV N, we performed a confocal microscopy analysis using rabbit anti-N antisera. In this report, we show that the wild type N was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal of the N, which contains the NLS1 (aa38\u201344), was localized to the nucleus. The C-terminus of the N, which contains both NLS2 (aa257\u2013265) and NLS3 (aa369\u2013390) was localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Results derived from analysis of various deletion mutations show that the region containing amino acids 226\u2013289 is able to mediate nucleolar localization. The deletion of two hydrophobic regions that flanked the NLS3 recovered its activity and localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, deletion of leucine rich region (220-LALLLLDRLNRL) resulted in the accumulation of N to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, and when fusing this peptide to EGFP localization was cytoplasmic, suggesting that the N may act as a shuttle protein. Differences in nuclear/nucleolar localization properties of N from other members of coronavirus family suggest a unique function for N, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timani, Khalid Amine; Liao, Qingjiao; Ye, Linbai; Zeng, Yingchun; Liu, Jing; Zheng, Yi; Ye, Li; Yang, Xiaojun; Lingbao, Kong; Gao, Jingrong; Zhu, Ying","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7bd3cb161196f1fa58ecd22d44f566d2fa45f0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114095.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170205001668; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170205001668","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV N","accumulation of N","N-terminal","nucleolar localization properties of N","wild type N","rabbit anti-N antisera","intracellular localization","EGFP localization","putative nuclear localization signal","pathogenesis of SARS","NLS3","nucleolus","nucleus","analysis of various deletion mutations","deletion of leucine rich region","members of coronavirus family","common nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern","Coronaviridae family","putative NLSs","novel coronavirus","important role","confocal microscopy analysis","aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","motifs present","unique function","LALLLLDRLNRL","proteins","peptide","Differences","amino acids","discernable homology","hydrophobic regions","Results","aa257","activity","NLS1","NLS2","C-terminus","shuttle protein","Nucleocapsid","aa38","report","aa369"],"language":"en"},

The MG is not an inductive site for mucosal immunity. Rather, synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig)A by plasma cells stimulated at distal inductive sites dominate in the milk of rodents, humans, and swine whereas IgG1 derived from serum predominates in ruminants. Despite the considerable biodiversity in the role of the MG, IgG passively transfers the maternal systemic immunological experience whereas IgA transfers the mucosal immunological experience. Although passive antibodies are protective, they and other lacteal constituents can be immunoregulatory. Immune protection of the MG largely depends on the innate immune system; the monocytes\u2013macrophages group together with intraepithelial lymphocytes is dominant in the healthy gland. An increase in somatic cells (neutrophils) and various interleukins signal infection (mastitis) and a local immune response in the MG. The major role of the MG to mucosal immunity is the passive immunity supplied to the suckling neonate.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, J.

The present study describes development and evaluation of a multiplexed magnetic microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) to simultaneously detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific for recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (recN) from hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

Screening of paired human sera using MMIA, resulted in 92 of 106 (sensitivity: 86%) as positive and 68 of 80 (specificity: 84%) as negative.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. METHODS: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain \u03B2 (SBD\u03B2). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD\u03B2 of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.

The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types.

Our results provide a primary analysis of the gene expression files of T. sinensis leaf and shoot on different development stages and afford a valuable resource for genetic and genomic research on plant lysine biosynthesis.","publish_time":"2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xia; Song, Zhenqiao; Liu, Tian; Guo, Linlin; Li, Xingfeng","journal":"Int J Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e96ff3220b7201598d2c5099ff9a4d03e529b3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4914729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27376077/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/6735209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sinensis leaf","sinensis leaves","lysine biosynthesis pathway","plant lysine biosynthesis","Toona sinensis Roem","shoots","unigenes","different development stages","leaf samples","primary analysis","Chinese cuisine","multiple developmental processes","enriched KEGG pathway","active metabolic processes","traditional Chinese medicine","high-throughput Illumina RNA-sequencing","genomic research","popular leafy vegetable","valuable resource","candidate genes","gene expression files","libraries","known biological functions","novo assembly","results","study","transcripts","total"],"language":"en"},

Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied. RESULTS: Positive predictive value and false positive rates were examined to assess the utility of three well-established nonparametric methods for the analysis of viral array hybridization data: (1) Mann-Whitney U, (2) the Spearman correlation coefficient and (3) the chi-square test. Of the three tests, the chi-square proved most useful. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptance of microarray use for routine clinical diagnostics will require that the technology be accompanied by simple yet reliable analytic methods. We report that our implementation of the chi-square test yielded a combination of low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy.","publish_time":"2010-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jabado, Omar J; Conlan, Sean; Quan, Phenix-Lan; Hui, Jeffrey; Palacios, Gustavo; Hornig, Mady; Briese, Thomas; Lipkin, W Ian","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/448c6dce11a897a8baa0815f46a77307b16049db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2909221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20584331/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chi-square test","analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data","Positive predictive value","Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution","combination of low false positive rates","nucleic acid integrity","distribution-free approaches","analysis of viral array hybridization data","host nucleic acid composition","clinical samples","acceptance of microarray use","routine clinical diagnostics","well-established nonparametric methods","reliable analytic methods","high degree of predictive accuracy","pathogen surveillance","discovery","Target template concentration","normality","deviations","profound effect","technology","utility","RESULTS","challenging task","Mann-Whitney U","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Spearman correlation coefficient","tests","implementation"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to study the influence of serum UA levels on mortality in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Data on 492 patients from a single peritoneal dialysis unit were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 53.5 \u00B1 15.3 years, with 52% being female (n = 255). The concomitant comorbidities at the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) encompassed diabetes mellitus (n = 179, 34.6%), hypertension (n = 419, 85.2%), and cardiovascular disease (n = 186, 37.9%). The study cohort was divided into sex-specific tertiles according to baseline UA level. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality with adjustments for demographic and laboratory data, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using UA tertile 1 as the reference, the adjusted HR of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for tertile 3 was 0.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24\u20130.68, p = 0.001), 0.4 (95% CI 0.2\u20130.81, p = 0.01), and 0.47 (95% CI 0.19\u20131.08, p = 0.1).

The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality and severity, and to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Methods We searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of diabetes was compared between patients with and without the composite endpoint of mortality or severity. Random effects model was used with odds ratio as the effect size. We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods. Results We included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37\u20132.64; p \u003C 0.01). Diabetes was also associated with severe COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09\u20133.62; p \u003C 0.01). The combined corrected pooled odds ratio of mortality or severity was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.74\u20132.68; p \u003C 0.01). The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%\u201310.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity). Conclusions Diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics.

Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we enrolled 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members in Wuhan. Patients were confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on throat swabs. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected. RESULTS: There were 155 close contacts in total. 104 contacts received RT-PCR assays, with 47 (30%) positive cases and 57 (37%) negative cases. 51 (33%) cases did not received RT-PCR tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of quarantine. The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 30%.

We investigated social behavior, endocrine profiles, and vaginal cytology of female coyotes (Canis latrans) during 4 breeding seasons, 2000\u20132003. Blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and relaxin were measured, and mating behavior and changes in vaginal epithelium were documented. After aligning the data from each individual to her estimated day of ovulation, we compared pregnant coyotes with nonpregnant females and evaluated temporal relationships among hormone levels, behavior, and vaginal cytology. We found that patterns of proceptive and receptive behaviors correlated with the secretion of steroid hormones, as did vaginal epithelial cytomorphosis. In addition, although progesterone levels of pregnant and pseudopregnant coyotes were indistinguishable, prolactin demonstrated a discernible intergroup difference and relaxin was only detectable in pregnant females. Although this study included characteristics not previously published for this species, it also showed how key aspects of reproduction were correlated temporally, and emphasized the importance of an integrated perspective when addressing the reproductive biology of coyotes, or other wild species of canids.","publish_time":"2008-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carlson, Debra A.; Gese, Eric M.","journal":"J Mammal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f35093950441cca4480b885bc95430a61bbd6c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287378/; https://doi.org/10.1644/06-mamm-a-436r1.1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaginal cytology of female coyotes","progesterone levels of pregnant","reproductive biology of coyotes","pseudopregnant coyotes","social behavior","vaginal epithelium","reproductive biology of wild Canis species","hormone levels","prolactin","relaxin","mating behavior","vaginal epithelial cytomorphosis","wild species of canids","Blood levels of estradiol","Canis latrans","social monogamy","physiological characteristics","nonpregnant females","tie","obligatory pseudopregnancy","temporal relationships","copulatory lock","monestrous cycle","unusual combination of behavioral","endocrine profiles","discernible intergroup difference","secretion of steroid hormones","receptive behaviors","biparental care","estimated day of ovulation","individual","mammals","integrated perspective","changes","patterns of proceptive","breeding seasons","addition","key aspects of reproduction","data","importance","study"],"language":"en"},

In order to identify domains in the N protein that bind to RNA, the whole protein (409 amino acids) and six overlapping fragments were expressed as fusion polypeptides with six histidine-tags. Using gel shift assays, the intact N protein and amino polypeptides, from residues 1 to 171 and residues 1 to 274, and carboxyl polypeptides, extending from residues 203 to 409 and residues 268 to 407, were found to interact with positive-stranded IBV RNA representing the 3\u2032 end of the genome. The two 32P-labeled probes that interacted with N and the amino and carboxyl fragments of N were RNA consisting of the IBV N gene and adjacent 3\u2032 non-coding terminus, and RNA consisting of the 155-nucleotide sequences at the 3\u2032 end of the 504-nt 3\u2032 untranslated region. In contrast, the polypeptide fragment from the middle region, residues 101\u2013283, did not interact with these 3\u2032 IBV RNAs. The binding site in the amino region of N was either not present or only partially present in the first 91 residues because no interaction with RNA was observed with the polypeptide incorporating these residues. Cache Valley virus N expressed with a histidine tag, bovine serum albumin, and the basic lysozyme protein did not shift the IBV RNA. The lower molarities of the carboxyl fragment compared with residue 1\u2013274 fragment needed for equivalent shifts suggested that the binding avidity for RNA at the carboxyl domain was greater than the amino domain.","publish_time":"2000-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Minglong; Collisson, Ellen W","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f67fbe3a031298155baeb6a73e83bb47ddc97d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125745.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020000126X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020000126X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV RNA","IBV N","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["residues","amino region of N","IBV N gene","intact N protein","carboxyl fragments of N","non-coding region of IBV RNA","amino polypeptides","positive-stranded IBV RNA","amino domain","carboxyl polypeptides","IBV RNAs","Cache Valley virus N","carboxyl domain","amino acids","middle region","polypeptide fragment","untranslated region","basic lysozyme protein","protein of infectious bronchitis virus","fusion polypeptides","end","non-coding terminus","histidine tag","overlapping fragments","binding avidity","histidine-tags","binding site","specific sequences","nucleotide sequences","gel shift assays","bovine serum albumin","nucleocapsid","equivalent shifts","Abstract Previous studies","lower molarities","domains","contrast","probes","order","interaction","genome"],"language":"en"},

The structure characterization of HCP-2 was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), acidic hydrolysis, PMP derivation, HPLC analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR). HCP-2 was elucidated as a pectic polysaccharide with a linear chain of 1,4-linked \u03B1-d-galacturonic acid residues in which part of the 6-carboxyl groups were methyl esterified and part of 2-hydroxyl groups were acetylated.

Abstract The detection, quantification and genetic analysis of viral genomes have become a common practice in clinical virology. This is exemplified by the study of human herpesviruses 6 and 7. The detection of viral DNA has led to implicate theses viruses in human diseases far beyond the evidence obtained by conventional approaches such as virus culture and serology. This is specially the case for immunocompromised subjects. The quantitation of DNA, in particular by means of real-time PCR, is now susceptible to differenciate reactivation from latency, predict the occurrence of clinical events, and monitor the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Genetic analyses have permitted the characterization of variant-specific polymorphisms and mutations responsible for resistance to antivirals. Despite some limitations that users have to be aware of, the study of viral genomes is an outstanding progress in medical virology.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agut, H; Fillet, A.

It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to central nervous system disorders as well as disordered enteric motility and associated wasting. For almost 40 years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected, but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series collected independently on different continents using a pan-viral microarray revealed a bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5% of the PDD cases (5/8) and none of the controls (0/8). Ultra high throughput sequencing was utilized to recover the complete viral genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a bornavirus-like genome organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence divergence from all prior bornavirus isolates. We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Further specific ABV PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection rate among PDD cases (71%, n = 7) compared to controls (0%, n = 14) (P = 0.01; Fisher\u0027s Exact Test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates we have now recovered from these and an additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups. CONCLUSION: These studies clearly demonstrate the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse bornaviruses and provide a compelling candidate in the search for an etiologic agent of PDD.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kistler, Amy L; Gancz, Ady; Clubb, Susan; Skewes-Cox, Peter; Fischer, Kael; Sorber, Katherine; Chiu, Charles Y; Lublin, Avishai; Mechani, Sara; Farnoushi, Yigal; Greninger, Alexander; Wen, Christopher C; Karlene, Scott B; Ganem, Don; DeRisi, Joseph L","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43f0ed0ead4058d6f92c7390c15d0d9fe66af448.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2546392.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18671869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["etiologic agent of PDD","virus-positive PDD cases","additional set of cases","avian bornavirus","controls","PDD case-control series","candidate etiologic agent","specific ABV PCR analysis","ABV detection rate","Partial sequence analysis","prior bornavirus isolates","complete viral genome sequence","distinct ABV genetic subgroups","viral etiology","bornavirus hybridization signature","central nervous system disorders","high degree of sequence divergence","peripheral nervous system","pan-viral microarray","compelling candidate","genome organization","avian reservoir","Proventricular dilatation disease","high throughput sequencing","significant difference","disordered enteric motility","fatal disorder","different continents","diverse bornaviruses","ganglia","search","wild psittacine birds","associated wasting","BACKGROUND","total","Fisher\u0027s Exact Test","existence","years","RESULTS","lymphoplasmacytic infiltration","studies","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The data collected on 3591 subjects in two similar RCTs conducted in Beijing, China, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooled. Four interventions were compared: (i) continuous N95 respirator use, (ii) targeted N95 respirator use, (iii) medical mask use and (iv) control arm. The outcomes were laboratory\u2010confirmed viral respiratory infection, influenza A or B, laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation and pathogens grouped by mode of transmission. RESULTS: Rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the continuous N95 and/or targeted N95 arms. In adjusted analysis, rates of laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21\u20100.51), laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23\u20100.91) and droplet\u2010transmitted infections (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.16\u20100.42) were significantly lower in the continuous N95 arm. Laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza was also lowest in the continuous N95 arm (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10\u20101.11), but the difference was not statistically significant. Rates of laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33\u20100.87) and droplet\u2010transmitted infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25\u20100.72) were also lower in the targeted N95 arm, but not in medical mask arm.

Though the clearest path currently being followed is the use of antiviral lectins as anti-HIV microbicides via topical mucosal administration, some investigators have also found systemic efficacy against acute infections following subcutaneous administration.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Carter A.; Ramessar, Koreen; O\u2019Keefe, Barry R.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e75fe23ba3ecab082dfce3efdc27624b6be002d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5414728.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216307999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28322922/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216307999","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of antiviral lectins","review groups lectins","natural lectins","antiviral activity","reported antiviral activities","structural class","subcutaneous administration","acute infections","viral infections","class of source organism","topical mucosal administration","useful clinical candidates","potential development candidates","anti-HIV microbicides","systemic efficacy","carbohydrate specificity","investigators","pertinent hurdles","heterologous proteins","examples","studies","brief discussion","literature","clearest path"],"language":"en"},

In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person. Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way. Problem Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists. The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus. Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers. Practical implications We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy. Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers. Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levin, Michael; Morais-Almeida, Mario; Ansotegui, Ignacio J.; Bernstein, Jonathan; Chang, Yoon-Seok; Chikhladze, Manana; Ebisawa, Motohiro; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Heffler, Enrico; Martin, Bryan; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Peden, David; Wong, Gary W.K.","journal":"World Allergy Organ J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b406deb4065c31d10ad7458147a164787da1eea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411315/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939455120300284?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100125; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939455120300284","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","nearby patients","utilization of nebulised therapy","expedient treatment of patients","high dose MDI therapy","severe asthma","risk of aerosolization","rapid initiation of systemic therapy","Asthma exacerbations","risk of aerosolised infection transmission","potential increased risk of infection","risk stratification plan","pandemic","health care providers","mild-moderate asthma","nebulisers","Problem Current emergency unit asthma guidelines","health-care workers","emergency units","current COVID","healthcare providers","metered dose inhaler","nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens","bronchodilators","spacer","greater concern","major threat","medical practices","electronic means","additional protection","telephone","context","order","flexibility","telehealth","SARS-CoV","Abstract Background","Practical implications","strategies","MDIs","choice","beta-agonists","Protocols","stage","coronavirus","cases","person","algorithm","way"],"language":"en"},

This disease is usually found to occur in individuals aged between 6 and 12 months, with a clinical phenotype resembling that of Hurler syndrome and radiological findings resembling those of dysostosis multiplex. However, we encountered a rare case of an infant with ML II who presented with prenatal skeletal dysplasia and typical clinical features of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at birth. A female infant was born at 37(\u002B1) weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 1,690 g (\u003C3rd percentile). Prenatal ultrasonographic findings revealed intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal dysplasia. At birth, the patient had characteristic features of ML II, and skeletal radiographs revealed dysostosis multiplex, similar to rickets. In addition, the patient had high levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone, consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The activities of \u03B2-D-hexosaminidase and \u03B1-N-acetylglucosaminidase were moderately decreased in the leukocytes but were 5- to 10-fold higher in the plasma. Examination of a placental biopsy specimen showed foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The diagnosis of ML II was confirmed via GNPTAB genetic testing, which revealed compound heterozygosity of c.3091C\u003ET (p.Arg1031X) and c.3456_3459dupCAAC (p.Ile1154GlnfsX3), the latter being a novel mutation.

The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims of the present study were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the efficiency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00B0C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 105.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 62.2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m(3) and 70.9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m(3) and 66.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for extraction. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus species and Micrococcus species. Conclusion These findings indicate potentially hazardous bioaerosols created during dental procedures can be significantly reduced using an air cleaning system.","publish_time":"2010-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hallier, C.; Williams, D.

The same pattern seems not to apply to a conventional suicide method, unless it was used by a celebrity. OBJECTIVE: 1) to examine media effects on both new and non-new suicide methods during 1998 and 2005 in Hong Kong (HK), when a new method by burning charcoal (CB suicide) was spreading in the region. 2) to examine how CB competed with non-CB methods in terms of media coverage and \u201Crecruiting\u201D suicidal persons in the socio-economic context. METHODS: A self- and mutual- exciting process model was fitted to the data, adjusting for divorce rate, unemployment rate, and property price index. Breaking the whole period into onset, peak, and post-peak stages, the model was fitted again to examine the differences. RESULTS: Comparable copycat effects were found on both CB and non-CB suicide news. The only cross-method media effects were found in the onset stage when non-CB suicide news showed suppressing effect on CB suicides. CB suicides reported a significant self-excitation effect. A higher divorce rate and lower property price index were associated with significantly more suicides incidences and more suicide news. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging of CB suicide method did not substitute media coverage of non-CB suicide in HK. Media effects in this case were not limited to new suicide method or celebrity suicide. The effects were further fueled by adverse socio-economic conditions.","publish_time":"2017-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Qijin; Chen, Feng; Yip, Paul S.

We aimed to identify the clinical and immunological factors that are related to C. difficile carriage in Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 400 stool samples were collected from cancer patients who received chemotherapy in three hospitals of eastern China. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted and two toxin genes (tcdA and tcdB) were detected. PCR ribotyping was performed using capillary gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03B2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS: Eighty-two (20.5%) samples were confirmed to be C. difficile-positive and positive for tpi, tcdA, and tcdB genes. The C. difficile-positive rates in patients with diarrhea and no diarrhea were 35% and 19.7%, respectively (p = 0.09). Patients who were younger than 50 years old and were hospitalized for at least 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate as high as 35%. In contrast, patients who were older than 50 years old and were hospitalized for less than 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate of only 12.7% (p = 0.0009). No association was found between C. difficile carriage and chemotherapy regimen, antibiotic drug use, or immunosuppressive mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03B2), or interleukin-10 (IL-10). Twelve ribotypes of C. difficile were identified, but none of them belonged to ribotype 027. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that younger patients and those with longer hospitalization stays may be more prone to C. difficile carriage. Studies of larger populations are warranted to clarify the exact role of C. difficile carriage in hospitalized cancer patients in China.

We evaluated the direct anti-influenza activity of three commercially available pomegranate extracts: pomegranate juice (PJ), a concentrated liquid extract (POMxl), and a 93% PP powder extract (POMxp). The acidity of PJ and POMxl solutions contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity, but this was not a factor with POMxp. Studies using POMxp showed that 5min treatment at room temperature with 800\u03BCg/ml PPs resulted in at least a 3log reduction in the titers of influenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H5N1 virus derived from a human isolate. However, the antiviral activity was less against a coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses derived from avian isolates. The loss of influenza infectivity was frequently accompanied by loss of hemagglutinating activity. PP treatment decreased Ab binding to viral surface molecules, suggesting some coating of particles, but this did not always correlate with loss of infectivity. Electron microscopic analysis indicated that viral inactivation by PPs was primarily a consequence of virion structural damage. Our findings demonstrate that the direct anti-influenza activity of pomegranate PPs is substantially modulated by small changes in envelope glycoproteins.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sundararajan, Aarthi; Ganapathy, Radha; Huan, Lifang; Dunlap, John R.; Webby, Richard J.; Kotwal, Girish J.; Sangster, Mark Y.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b4939fbcc081a9bf7730c344c1c3218651c0b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114265.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210006686; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210006686; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.06.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20637243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["direct anti-influenza activity of pomegranate PPs","rapid anti-influenza activity","antiviral activity","loss of influenza infectivity","loss of hemagglutinating activity","reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses","POMxp","titers of influenza viruses PR8","loss of infectivity","pomegranate juice","PP treatment","available pomegranate extracts","reassortant H5N1 virus","PP powder extract","viral inactivation","POMxl solutions","acidity of PJ","viral surface molecules","concentrated liquid extract","Ab binding","H1N1","coronavirus","high levels of polyphenols","small changes","avian isolates","Electron microscopic analysis","rich source of compounds","Abstract Pomegranates","X31","H3N2","\u03BCg","log reduction","consequence of virion structural damage","human isolate","room temperature","envelope glycoproteins","coating of particles","findings","factor","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Ebolavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus disease (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically na\u00EFve populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV (protected from exposure by rivers as topological barriers of transmission). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically na\u00EFve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%.","publish_time":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reed, Patricia E.; Mulangu, Sabue; Cameron, Kenneth N.; Ondzie, Alain U.; Joly, Damien; Bermejo, Magdalena; Rouquet, Pierre; Fabozzi, Giulia; Bailey, Michael; Shen, Zhimin; Keele, Brandon F.; Hahn, Beatrice; Karesh, William B.; Sullivan, Nancy J.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e24bf8c23979d56fff33bd4ed96fb00a117f701b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4169258.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25232832/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV exposure","virus exposure","future EBOV infections","ebolavirus vaccines","resident great apes","na\u00EFve populations","Ebola virus disease","current outbreak of ebolavirus","ebolavirus geographical distribution","evidence of antibodies","intervention","gorillas","early detection of increased incidence of exposure","successful noninvasive detection of antibodies","na\u00EFve at-risk populations","great ape outbreaks","local communities","local importance","human EVD","wild ape feces","profound impact","EIDs","efforts","public health","hotspot","vaccination","offs","potential targets","rivers","strategy","emerging infectious diseases","cause of die","recent declines","overall prevalence rate","new approach","average","infected wildlife carcasses","topological barriers of transmission","case-fatality rates","vaccine efficacy","multiple countries","Central Africa","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","means","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","effectiveness","species"],"language":"en"},

Although the diffusers in the proposed system were close to the passengers\u0027 legs, the air velocity magnitude was acceptable in the lower part of the cabin and the leg area. The proposed system provided an acceptable thermal environment in the cabin, although passengers could feel cold when placing their legs directly in front of the diffusers.

JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. Aim of study The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. Materials and methods A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1\u0027s anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. Results HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability. However, these effects were not exerted via downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins such as HVEM, Nectin-1, or Nectin-2. The specific anti-HSV-2 mechanism of JZ-1 need to be further explored. Conclusion The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir and berberine in vitro, and was mainly mediated by enhancing host cell defense and blocking adhesion and penetration of HSV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, Qianni; Liu, Tong; Yuan, Ping; Huang, Cong; Shao, Qingqing; Xu, Lijun; Sun, Jun; Huang, Guangyin; Chen, Zhuo","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f3fa64c7e7bf6e03f3628adbacd36676e8affa4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126206.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119325875; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119325875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31743766/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.112405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genital Herpes","HVEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of JZ","penetration of HSV","h of JZ","mechanism of JZ","blocking HSV","model of HSV","Results HSV","significant anti-HSV","s anti-HSV","specific anti-HSV","cell viability","cell morphology","host cell defense","host cell proteins HVEM","adhesion","cell ultrastructural pathology","improved host cell morphologies","increased host cell viabilities","E6E7","penciclovir","treatment","Nectin","penetration of host cells","clear effect","distinct effect","penetration stages","expression of viral proteins gB","gD","room temperature","temperature control techniques","anti-herpes simplex virus type","expression of viral glycoprotein D","GH","VP16","ICP5","therapeutic effects","ICP4","mins","infection of VK2","berberine","downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins","Trichomonas vaginitis","Genital Herpes","Candida albicans vaginitis","obvious adverse reactions","Chinese Herbal Prescription JieZe","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","Qing Dynasty","preventive","series of times","famous formula","year of Kangxi","Yihuang Decoction","Materials","methods","exact time","study","Conclusion","experiments","order"],"language":"en"},

Management requires coordinated responses, across many disciplines and nations, and the capacity to muster proper national and global public health education, infrastructure, and prevention measures. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of nations are ruled by autocratic regimes which have characteristically failed to adopt investments in public health infrastructure, education, and prevention measures to keep pace with population growth and density. Autocratic leaders have a direct impact on health security, a direct negative impact on health, and create adverse political and economic conditions that only complicate the crisis further. This is most evident in autocratic regimes where health protections have been seriously and purposely curtailed. All autocratic regimes define public health along economic and political imperatives that are similar across borders and cultures. Autocratic regimes are seriously handicapped by sociopathic narcissistic leaders who are incapable of understanding the health consequences of infectious diseases or the impact on their population. A cross section of autocratic nations currently experiencing the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are reviewed to demonstrate the manner where self-serving regimes fail to manage health crises and place the rest of the world at increasing risk.

The frequency of preterm births is about 12\u201313% in the USA and 5\u20139% in many other developed countries; however, the rate of preterm birth has increased in many locations, predominantly because of increasing indicated preterm births and preterm delivery of artificially conceived multiple pregnancies.

Births that follow spontaneous preterm labour and PPROM\u2014together called spontaneous preterm births\u2014are regarded as a syndrome resulting from multiple causes, including infection or inflammation, vascular disease, and uterine overdistension. Risk factors for spontaneous preterm births include a previous preterm birth, black race, periodontal disease, and low maternal body-mass index.

A typical example is the case of display of peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues on the major coat protein, protein VIII of the filamentous bacteriophages M13 and fd. A solution to this problem has been the use of \u201Ctwo-gene systems\u201D generating chimeric phages that concomitantly express wild-type protein VIII along with recombinant protein VIII. Although the two-gene systems are much more permissive in regard to insert length and composition, some cases can still adversely affect phage assembly. Although these phages genotypically contain the desired DNA of the insert, they appear to be phenotypically wild type. To avoid false-negative results when using chimeric phages in binding studies, it is necessary to confirm that the observed lack of phage recognition is not due to faulty assembly and display of the intended insert. Here we describe a strategy for generating antibodies that specifically recognize recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of its foreign insert. These antibodies can be used as a general monitor of the display of recombinant protein VIII into phage particles.","publish_time":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaplan, Gilad; Gershoni, Jonathan M.","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/201c08e3aee651a579d97d12b2ef4297a3b0992e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094602.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.08.050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269711005951; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269711005951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21945353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["display of recombinant protein","protein expression","phage assembly","intended insert","foreign insert","recombinant phage proteins","major coat protein","express wild-type protein","phage particles","chimeric phages","case of display","observed lack of phage recognition","faulty assembly","gene systems","wild type","antibodies","negative effect","false-negative results","amino acid residues","peptides","binding studies","filamentous bacteriophages M13","length","regard","cases","general monitor","nature","composition","fd","typical example","use","desired DNA","problem","solution","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Just as cells are increasingly understood to employ nascent RNAs in transcription regulation, recent discoveries are revealing how viruses use nascent RNAs to benefit their own gene expression. In this review, we first outline the two different transcription programs used by viruses, i.e., transcription (DNA-dependent) and RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Subsequently, we use the distinct stages (initiation, elongation, termination) to describe the latest insights into nascent RNA-mediated regulation in the context of each relevant stage.","publish_time":"2017-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harwig, Alex; Landick, Robert; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbffb6a287ece187b7ad9ceb9f703854b0ea8e1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5691660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065472/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v9100309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcription regulation","viruses","Transcription control","different transcription programs","nascent RNA-mediated regulation","nascent RNAs","RNA-dependent RNA synthesis","foundation of gene regulation","benefit","DNA-dependent","gene expression","cellular host processes","recent discoveries","diverse ways","latest insights","termination","adaptation","context","initiation","elongation","distinct stages","course of evolution","tools","relevant stage","task","cells","review"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, characterisation of viral pathogens in bat communities provides important basal information to monitor and predict the emergence of diseases relevant to conservation and public health. This study used targeted molecular techniques, serological assays and next generation sequencing to characterise adenoviruses, coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses from 11 species of insectivorous bats within the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia. Phylogenetic analysis indicated complex ecological interactions including virus\u2013host associations, cross-species infections, and multiple viral strains circulating concurrently within selected bat populations. Additionally, we describe the entire coding sequences for five alphacoronaviruses (representing four putative new species), and one novel adenovirus.

The objectives were to evaluate the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia in hospitalized children with pneumonia from developing countries, to identify predictors of hypoxemia, and to characterize factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A multicenter, observational study was conducted in five hospitals, from India (Lucknow, Vadu), Madagascar (Antananarivo), Mali (Bamako), and Paraguay (San Lorenzo). Children aged 2\u201360 months with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled prospectively. Respiratory and whole blood specimens were collected, identifying viruses and bacteria by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia at admission (oxygen saturation \u003C 90%) were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and factors associated with 14-day in-hospital mortality were assessed by bivariate Cox regression. Overall, 405 pneumonia cases (3,338 hospitalization days) were analyzed; 13 patients died within 14 days of hospitalization. Hypoxemia prevalence was 17.3%.

METHODS: Differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) grown on collagen-coated filters were exposed apically to HRV14 for 6 h, washed thoroughly and co-cultured with anti-CD3/CD28 activated T cells added in the basolateral compartment for 40 h. RESULTS: HRV14 did not induce IFN\u03B3, NOS2, CXCL8 and IL-6 in HNEC, but enhanced expression of the T cell attractant CXCL10. On the other hand, HNEC co-cultured with activated T cells produced CXCL10 at a level several orders of magnitude higher than that induced by HRV14. Albeit to a much lower degree, activated T cells also induced CXCL8, IL-6 and NOS2. Anti-IFN\u03B3 antibodies and TNF soluble receptor completely blocked CXCL10 upregulation. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between epithelial CXCL10 mRNA expression and the amounts of IFN\u03B3 and TNF secreted by T cells. Likewise, increasing numbers of T cells to a constant number of HNEC in co-cultures resulted in increasing epithelial CXCL10 production, attaining a plateau at high IFN\u03B3 and TNF levels. Hence, HNEC activation by T cells is induced mainly by IFN\u03B3 and/or TNF. Activated T cells also markedly inhibited viral replication in HNEC, partially through activation of the nitric oxide pathway. CONCLUSION: Cross-talk between T cells and HNEC results in activation of the latter and increases their contribution to airway inflammation and virus clearance.","publish_time":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jornot, Lan; Cordey, Samuel; Caruso, Assunta; Gerber, Christine; Vukicevic, Marija; Tapparel, Caroline; Kaiser, Laurent; Burger, Danielle; Roosnek, Eddy; Lacroix, Jean Silvain; Rochat, Thierry","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a3087521fb05ef9bc29193574d33bbec23b9b33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3194808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22022590/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activated T cells","numbers of T cells","HNEC activation","HNEC results","T cell attractant CXCL10","HNEC co-cultured","inflammatory responses of airway epithelial cells","primary human nasal epithelial cells","epithelial CXCL10 production","epithelial CXCL10 mRNA expression","constant number of HNEC","amounts of IFN\u03B3","high IFN\u03B3","HRV14","Anti-IFN\u03B3 antibodies","TNF levels","blocked CXCL10 upregulation","co-cultures","TNF soluble receptor","CXCL8","NOS2","human rhinoviruses","anti-CD3","enhanced expression","airway inflammation","plateau","antiviral","CD28","viral replication","basolateral compartment","contribution","virus clearance","orders of magnitude higher","METHODS","hand","collagen-coated filters","significant correlation","nitric oxide pathway","lower degree","HYPOTHESIS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These wild herbivores are commonly found near water bodies and are well adapted to rural and urban areas. There is limited information on the viruses circulating through capybaras. This study aimed to expand the knowledge on the viral diversity associated with capybaras by sampling their faeces. Using a viral metagenomics approach, we identified diverse single-stranded DNA viruses in the capybara faeces sampled in the Distrito Federal, Brazil. A total of 148 complete genomes of viruses in the Microviridae family were identified. In addition, 14 genomoviruses (family Genomoviridae), a novel cyclovirus (family Circoviridae), and a smacovirus (family Smacoviridae) were identified. Also, 37 diverse viruses that cannot be assigned to known families and more broadly referred to as unclassified circular replication associated protein encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses were identified. This study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity associated with capybaras that may be infectious to these animals or associated with their microbiota or diet.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontenele, Rafaela S.; Lacorte, Cristiano; Lamas, Natalia S.; Schmidlin, Kara; Varsani, Arvind; Ribeiro, Simone G.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4f6baab270ef953349d05c6f2936803c92bf4b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382446/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Distrito Federal"],"locations":["South America","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["Capybaras","diverse viruses","diverse single-stranded DNA viruses","family Genomoviridae","family Circoviridae","Microviridae family","family Smacoviridae","viral diversity","complete genomes of viruses","study","viral metagenomics approach","unclassified circular replication associated protein","capybara faeces","novel cyclovirus","world\u2019s largest rodents","Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris","Distrito Federal","smacovirus","CRESS","water bodies","addition","genomoviruses","total","snapshot","knowledge","wild herbivores","South America","limited information","microbiota","animals","urban areas","Brazil","diet","families"],"language":"en"},

Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants are still circulating in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the B1648 strain (5\u2032UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in B1648 and most of the other IBV complete genomes. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with the non-Massachusetts type strains NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with the strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and, further designated as B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference Beaudette and Massachusetts strains (89.7%). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that B1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.","publish_time":"2015-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddy, Vishwanatha R.A.P.; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Roukaerts, Inge D.M.; Zeller, Mark; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b51c5f53980e0118362f26862e1243aac186a4ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4576188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26262637/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7082827","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGA"],"locations":["Belgium","Europe","North Africa","Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["strain B1648","B1648 strain","b-S","b-E","b-N","B1648 genotype","full-length genome of B1648","IBV strains","Massachusetts strains","strains TN20","Europe","Belgian NIBV reference strain","non-Massachusetts type strains NGA","spike protein","evolution of IBV","A116E7","UKr","ORFs","North Africa","QX","UTR","SLO","partial S1 gene","partial S1 fragment","IBV complete genomes","reference Beaudette","nephropathogenicity determinants","highest sequence homology","amino acid sequence analyses","replicase transcriptase complex","virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus","important role","NGS","Nucleotide","evolutionary relationship","variants","generation sequencing","phylogenetic analysis","open reading frames","CK","SWE","possible genetic factors","Gray","JMK","intensive vaccination","accessory proteins","Flanders","parts","world","ITA","literature","Belgium"],"language":"en"},

VLPs are robust protein cages in the nanometer range that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome. They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety. VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities. In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens. VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines.

Compared to conventional antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used as pharmacological molecules have particular physical characteristics and modes of action, and, therefore, they should be considered as a distinct therapeutic class. Despite being historically validated, antibodies may represent a novel tool for combatting infectious diseases. The current high cost of mAbs\u0027 production, storage and administration (by injection only) and the consequent obstacles to development are outweighed by mAbs\u0027 clinical advantages. These are related to a low toxicity combined with high specificity and versatility, which allows a specific antibody to mediate various biological effects, ranging from the virus neutralization mechanisms to the modulation of immune responses. This review briefly summarizes the recent technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, and the current status of mAb-based drugs in clinical trials for HIV and HCV diseases. For each clinical trial the available data are reported and the emerging conceptual problems of the employed mAbs are highlighted.

The study sample consists of 40 patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute bipolar depression. Blood samples were drawn at 3 time points: at time of hospital admission, during the acute hospital stay, and at a six month follow-up. Inflammatory markers were measured including C-reactive protein (CRP), Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and antibodies to infectious agents. The markers in the bipolar depressed patients were studied over the 3 time points and also compared to those in other groups: 60 hospitalized for acute mania; 69 with recent onset psychosis; 246 with multi-episode schizophrenia; 98 with bipolar disorder not selected for mania or depression; and 222 non-psychiatric controls. The bipolar depressed patients had elevated levels of CRP at all 3 time points. The bipolar depressed patients also had elevated levels of PTX3 at hospital admission which were reduced during the hospital stay and at follow-up. The bipolar depressed group also had elevated levels of antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS strain of coronavirus, while elevated levels of these antibodies were not found in the other groups. Our study indicates that bipolar disorder depression is associated with immune activation, particularly during acute exacerbations. These findings may lead to the development of new methods of prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dickerson, F.; Yolken, R.","journal":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159113003942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113003942","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pentraxin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bipolar depressed patients","bipolar disorder depression","acute hospital","bipolar depressed group","pathogenesis of bipolar disorder","diagnosis of acute bipolar depression","elevated levels of antibodies","time of hospital admission","time points","elevated levels of CRP","elevated levels of PTX3","acute mania","acute exacerbations","immune activation","groups","nucleocapsid protein","Recent studies","Inflammatory markers","study sample","month follow-up","C-reactive protein","recent onset psychosis","multi-episode schizophrenia","important component","SARS strain of coronavirus","development of new methods of prevention","Pentraxin","non-psychiatric controls","treatment","infectious agents","Blood samples","findings"],"language":"en"},

Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust\u2014compared to pathogen or moral disgust\u2014would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men\u2019s sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ray, Travis N.; Parkhill, Michele R.","journal":"Sex Roles","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7ad66bbe87e4c4cbbe1fdbf34345b6de8f05ad1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226200/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-020-01146-w","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["sexual disgust","heterosexual men","gay men\u2019s sexual behavior","moral disgust","sex sexual behavior","hostile attitudes","heteronormative attitudes","sexual orientation","disgust sensitivity","likely elicitor of disgust","antigay hostility","heteronormative ideology","gay men\u2019s violation of heteronormativity","likely contributors","emotional reactions","social force","social hierarchy","moral transgression","perceived pathogen threat","dominant group members\u2019 status","tolerance","online questionnaire","United States","hypotheses","intergroup boundaries","findings","theoretical framework","intervention efforts","relationship","Results"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS-CoV2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor non-structural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS-CoV2 (AS-SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS-SCoV2 located in the acidic-domain of papain-like protein of SARS-CoV2 and bat-SL-RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain-like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored. This article is protected by copyright.

Serological investigations on 216 dog sera, carried out by an ELISA test using the strictly related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as antigen, revealed an overall CRCoV seroprevalence of 32.06% in the last 2 years. RT-PCR targeting the S-gene of CRCoV was carried out on 109 lung samples collected from carcasses of dogs submitted for diagnostic investigations. Positive results were obtained from the lungs of a dog of the Apulia region that was co-infected with canine parvovirus type 2. Sequence analysis of the S-gene fragment amplified by RT-PCR (595bp) showed similarity to group II coronaviruses, with the highest nucleotide identity (98%) to the only CRCoV strain currently available in the GenBank database (strain T101). The results of the present study show that CRCoV is present also in continental Europe, although further studies are required to determine the real pathogenic potential of the virus.","publish_time":"2007-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decaro, Nicola; Desario, Costantina; Elia, Gabriella; Mari, Viviana; Lucente, Maria Stella; Cordioli, Paolo; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3649053359a7c968827c3617c51e0eb55d1e703e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117267.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506005013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506005013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["CRCoV strain","identification of CRCoV","overall CRCoV seroprevalence","Abstract Canine respiratory coronavirus","lung samples of dogs","bovine coronavirus","RT-PCR","Serological investigations","dog sera","group","canine infectious respiratory disease","canine parvovirus type","S-gene fragment","Italian dog population","carcasses of dogs","present study","strain T101","serological evidence","diagnostic investigations","Positive results","antigen","GenBank database","Apulia region","CIRD","Italy","coronaviruses","lungs","continental Europe","Sequence analysis","real pathogenic potential","highest nucleotide identity","studies","ELISA test","similarity","UK","BCoV","bp","time","years"],"language":"en"},

Short interfering RNA technology affords a potential tractable strategy to combat viral pathogenesis because siRNAs are specific, easy to design, and can be directed against multiple strains of a virus by targeting their conserved gene regions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current status of siRNA therapy for representative examples from different virus families.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the viral etiology and epidemiology of ILI in households. STUDY DESIGN: ILI was detected by active case finding amongst a cohort of 263 northern Vietnam households between 2008 and 2013. Health workers collected nose and throat swabs for virus detection by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7%) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3%) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28%), Influenza virus (17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3%), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5%) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8%). There was no clear seasonality, but 78% of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32% for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below 5 years increased (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need for tailored ILI control strategies, and for better understanding of how local childcare practices and seasonality may influence transmission and the role of children.","publish_time":"2016-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Diep Ngoc Thi; Mai, Le Quynh; Bryant, Juliet E.; Hang, Nguyen Le Khanh; Hoa, Le Nguyen Minh; Nadjm, Behzad; Thai, Pham Quang; Duong, Tran Nhu; Anh, Dang Duc; Horby, Peter; van Doorn, H.

We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ARDS.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity (host sharing) and heterogeneity (host specificity). Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species -avian coronavirus and influenza A virus- and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while virome heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, as well as differences in viral abundance and alpha diversity among species.

Moreover, HAIs, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods, have become a top global priority. Although adequate approaches and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have often proven effective in some countries, the implementation of such approaches in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often restricted due to limited resources and underdeveloped infrastructure. While evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and practices are universal, studies are needed to evaluate simplified approaches that can be better adapted to LMIC needs, in order to guide IPC in practice.

This viral infection causes acute diarrhea leading to death. Rapid identification of infected calves is essential to control BRV successfully. Therefore development of simple, highly specific, and sensitive detection method for BRV is needed. RESULTS: A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of BRV. Specific primer sets were designed to target the sequences of the VP6 gene of the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) strain of BRV. The RT-LAMP assay was performed in a water bath for 60 minutes at 63\u00B0C, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light. This BRV specific RT-LAMP assay could detect 3.32 copies of subtype A BRV. No cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect bovine rotavirus was further evaluated with 88 bovine rectal swab samples. Twenty-nine of these samples were found to be positive for BRV using RT-LAMP. The BRV-specific-RT-LAMP results were also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: The bovine rotavirus-specific RT-LAMP assay was highly sensitive and holds promise as a prompt and simple diagnostic method for the detection of group A bovine rotavirus infection in young calves.","publish_time":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Zhixun; Fan, Qing; Liu, Jiabo; Pang, Yaoshan; Deng, Xianwen; Xie, Zhiqin; Liji, Xie; Khan, Mazhar I","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/956d1b132a0bb6b7ebd9ca19e312ef0fd7ca7cb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3599620.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894568/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BRV-specific","BRV specific RT-LAMP assay","bovine rotavirus-specific RT-LAMP assay","RT-LAMP results","strain of BRV","rapid detection of BRV","ability of RT","bovine rotavirus infection","real-time RT-PCR assay","bovine pathogens","young calves","bovine rectal swab samples","sensitive detection method","Specific primer sets","detection of group","viral infection","Rapid identification of infected calves","simple diagnostic method","acute diarrhea","isothermal amplification","amplification products","development of simple","neonatal calf diarrhea virus","NCDV","VP6 gene","reverse transcription loop","prompt","water bath","minutes","sequences","death","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","copies","cross-reactions","ultraviolet light"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine the median time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis and to identify the potential predictors of this interval in Saudi Arabian MERS patients. Methods This was a retrospective study of patients with confirmed MERS who were publicly reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results Five hundred and thirty-seven symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection were included. The median time interval between symptom onset and confirmation of the MERS diagnosis was 4 days (interquartile range 2\u20137 days), ranging from 0 to 36 days. According to the negative binomial model, the unadjusted rate ratio (RR) of delays in the diagnosis was significantly higher in older patients (\u003E65 years) (RR 1.42), non-healthcare workers (RR 1.74), patients with severe illness (RR 1.22), those with an unknown source of infection (RR 1.84), and those who had been in close contact with camels (RR 1.74). After accounting for confounders, the adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of delays in the diagnosis was independently associated with unknown source of infection (aRR 1.68) and close contact with camels (aRR 1.58). Conclusions The time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was greater in older patients, non-healthcare workers, patients with severe illness, patients with an unknown source of infection, and patients who had been in close contact with camels. The findings warrant educational interventions to raise general public awareness of the importance of early symptom notification.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01ad54cabdcd7e03fa2f4bf689137cca0f4a4729.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110630.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217301868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28728926/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217301868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS diagnosis","older patients","Saudi Arabian MERS patients","confirmed diagnosis","retrospective study of patients","symptom onset","MERS-CoV","confirmed MERS","unknown source of infection","median time interval","aRR","CoV infection","close contact","camels","days","patient delays","symptomatic cases of MERS","non-healthcare workers","severe illness","importance of early symptom notification","unadjusted rate ratio","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","medical support","general public awareness","infections","confirmation","educational interventions","poor clinical outcomes","potential predictors","negative binomial model","interquartile range","literature","confounders","Conclusions","findings","accounting","years","Abstract Background","World Health Organization","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The SecY complex (SecYEG) in bacteria forms a membrane channel responsible for protein translocation. The present work shows that permeabilized SecY channels can be used as nonspecific sugar transporters in Escherichia coli. SecY with the plug domain deleted allowed the passage of glucose, fructose, mannose, xylose, and arabinose, and, with additional pore\u2010ring mutations, facilitated lactose transport, indicating that sugar passage via permeabilized SecY was independent of sugar stereospecificity. The engineered E. coli showed rapid growth on a wide spectrum of monosaccharides and benefited from the elimination of transport saturation, improvement in sugar tolerance, reduction in competitive inhibition, and prevention of carbon catabolite repression, which are usually encountered with native sugar uptake systems. The SecY channel is widespread in prokaryotes, so other bacteria may also be engineered to utilize this system for sugar uptake. The SecY channel thus provides a unique sugar passageway for future development of robust cell factories for biotechnological applications.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Qiang; Mei, Sen; Xie, Chong; Mi, Hao; Jiang, Yang; Zhang, Shi\u2010Ding; Tan, Tian\u2010Wei; Fan, Li\u2010Hai","journal":"Biotechnol Bioeng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eca0443ef870b212ee1d78d59aff77c227ba1ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32048725/; https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27306","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sugar tolerance","nonspecific sugar transporters","unique sugar passageway","independent of sugar stereospecificity","SecY complex","native sugar uptake systems","initial step of sugar metabolism","permeabilized SecY channels","passage of sugars","passage of glucose","bacteria","membrane channel responsible","lactose transport","specific transporters","Escherichia coli","elimination of transport saturation","future development of robust cell factories","competitive inhibition","reduction","improvement","rapid growth","decisive role","ring mutations","mannose","additional pore","prevention of carbon catabolite repression","biotechnological applications","wide spectrum of monosaccharides","arabinose","xylose","plasma membranes","fructose","protein translocation","SecYEG","present work","prokaryotes","plug domain","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, it traces the national-level institutional changes in its disaster management, and then closely examines a hydrofluoric gas leakage in the industrial city of Gumi. The finding is that South Korea simultaneously carried out both centralization and decentralization of disaster management, which are not contradictory but rather complementary. Nevertheless, while the country successfully set up an integrated and comprehensive national-level management system, from which disaster governance can successfully be decentralized to localities, it still requires much more developed and consolidated multilevel (vertical) and broader (horizontal) collaboration, which are the preconditions for decentralized disaster governance.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bae, Yooil; Joo, Yu-Min; Won, Soh-Yeon","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcb0855b58b356b4e47c8349b5c0047d76a61bc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132686.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397515300230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.08.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397515300230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287705/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Decentralized"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Gumi"],"keyphrases":["disaster management system","decentralization of disaster management","Abstract Decentralized disaster governance","comprehensive national-level management system","urbanized country","case of South Korea","national-level institutional changes","urbanized areas","recent decentralization reforms","attention","rising global urbanization rate","complex nature","industrial city of Gumi","hydrofluoric gas leakage","disasters","order","paper studies","evolution","preconditions","collaboration","implications","finding","experience","localities"],"language":"en"},

We sampled and genetically characterized in detail a contact zone of two subtaxa of the rodent Mastomys natalensis in Tanzania. We find two distinct arenaviruses, Gairo and Morogoro virus, each spatially confined to a single M. natalensis subtaxon, only co-occurring at the contact zone\u2019s centre. Inter-subtaxon hybridization at this centre and a continuum of quality habitat for M. natalensis show that both viruses have the ecological opportunity to spread into the other substaxon\u2019s range, but do not, strongly suggesting host-intrinsic barriers.

Calves were divided into 2 groups: COL\u002B (n =10) received fresh colostrum; and COL\u2212 (n =10) which received frozen colostrum containing no viable cells. The calves were assessed before colostrum intake (D0), 48h of age (D2), and weekly from D7 up to D28. Blood samples were collected for analysis of the distribution of leukocytes, cellular phenotype and in vitro granulocyte function. COL\u002B calves tended to have a high number of neutrophils on D7 (p =0.073). COL\u2212 calves took up significantly more Escherichia coli (measured as MFI) on D7 (p =0.034). Endogenous production of radicals (as percentage of cells) tended to be higher in COL\u2212 calves on D14 (p =0.061). The intensity of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by granulocytes tended to be higher in COL\u002B calves on D21 (p =0.094). Overall, ROS production (percent of cells, and MFI) induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were higher in COL\u002B calves than COL\u2212 calves. It was our observation that COL\u002B calves developed an innate immune response more quickly and efficiently after natural exposure to pathogens after birth. In contrast, COL\u2212 calves mounted an innate response more slowly that yielded a persistent inflammatory response after natural exposure to these bacteria agents.

Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming, climatic changes, which together with globalization, increased trade, the shortening of distances thanks to transport, the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. Vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks; wild birds are reservoirs for the West Nile virus, small wild mammals such as rodents, bats, and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses, and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzm\u00E1n, Camilo; Calder\u00F3n, Alfonso; Mattar, Salim; Tadeu-Figuereido, Luiz; Salazar-Bravo, Jorge; Alvis-Guzm\u00E1n, Nelson; Martinez, Elias Zakzuk; Gonz\u00E1lez, Marco","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/667f73e8a3311cf74bc2e8573ec0db1404ac21a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150051.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","European Union"],"keyphrases":["vectors of arboviruses","reservoirs","mosquito vectors","expansion of vectors","chikungunya virus","Zika virus","dengue virus","human populations","new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance","West Nile virus","epidemic outbreaks","appearance of outbreaks","climatic changes","major changes","diseases","cases","human activity result","socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances","wild birds","important effects","food habits","different levels","food production","small wild mammals","Different cohabiting species","alteration of habitat","rodents","global warming","shortening of distances thanks","nonspecific febrile syndrome","hemorrhagic fever","European Union","contrast","disappearance of natural sources","United States","transport","encephalitis","time","domestic animals","bats","globalization","mosquitoes","great impact","ticks","developed countries","increased trade","habitats","insects","size","ecosystems","higher latitudes","structure","ecoepidemiological role","alphaviruses","hosts","clinical signs","altitudes","Abstract","death"],"language":"en"},

Many of the receptors and ligands involved in NK cell antimicrobial activity have been identified, and we are beginning to appreciate how they function during infection. In addition, NK cells are activated by cytokines (e.g. interleukin 12 and type I interferons), which are products of activated macrophages and dendritic cells. In response to these activating stimuli, NK cells secrete cytokines and chemokines and lyse target cells. Recent studies have focused on the mechanisms by which NK cells recognize and respond to viruses, parasites and bacteria, and on the unique role of NK cells in innate immunity to infection.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lodoen, Melissa B; Lanier, Lewis L","journal":"Current Opinion in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27f86e97beabb028fb9f545e94139b0ff1c6d476.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127478.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791506000963; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791506000963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recognition","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unique role of NK cells","dendritic cells","target cells","NK cell surface","NK cell antimicrobial activity","NK cell effector functions","cytokines","Recognition of infection","activation of receptors","products of activated macrophages","tumors","innate immunity","ligands","activating stimuli","chemokines","line of defense","bacteria","mechanisms","viruses","diverse range of pathogens","response","Natural killer","Recent studies","interferons","parasites","interleukin","addition"],"language":"en"},

There were no differences in need for ICU care, 100 day mortality, hospice discharge, relapse of disease, GVHD or development of disease or infection due to CMV or EBV. Other infectious complications after rhinovirus diagnosis were also equal. However, there was an increased number of recurrent hospitalizations from any cause among cases (46.8% vs. 24.5%, P=0.007). Recurrent hospitalizations due to any infection were also more common in cases (34% vs. 14.9%, P=0.015). For patients who were diagnosed with rhinovirus pre-transplant (n=13), there was no difference in outcomes compared to matched controls.

They are metastable and poised for structural changes. These features allow viruses to communicate with host cells during entry, and to release the viral genome, a process known as uncoating. Studies have shown that hundreds of host factors directly or indirectly support this process. The cell provides molecules that promote stepwise virus uncoating, and direct the virus to the site of replication. It acts akin to a snooker player who delivers accurate and timely shots (cues) to the ball (virus) to score. The viruses, on the other hand, trick (snooker) the host, hijack its homeostasis systems, and dampen innate immune responses directed against danger signals. In this review, we discuss how cellular cues, facilitators, and built\u2010in viral mechanisms promote uncoating. Cues come from receptors, enzymes and chemicals that act directly on the virus particle to alter its structure, trafficking and infectivity. Facilitators are defined as host factors that are involved in processes which indirectly enhance entry or uncoating. Unraveling the mechanisms of virus uncoating will continue to enhance understanding of cell functions, and help counteracting infections with chemicals and vaccines.

This review aimed at summarizing and discussing recent advances concerning the management of muscle disease in systemic diseases. METHOD: Literature review by search of MEDLINE, and Current Contents with appropriate search terms. RESULTS: Secondary muscle disease occurs in infectious disease, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, immunological disease, vascular diseases, hematological disorders, and malignancies. Muscle manifestations in these categories include pathogen\u2010caused myositis, muscle infarction, rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia, immune\u2010mediated myositis, necrotising myopathy, or vasculitis\u2010associated myopathy. Muscle affection may concern only a single muscle, a group of muscles, or the entire musculature. Severity of muscle affection may be transient or permanent, may be a minor part of or may dominate the clinical picture, or may be mild or severe, requiring invasive measures including artificial ventilation if the respiratory muscles are additionally involved. Diagnostic work\u2010up is similar to that of primary myopathies by application of non\u2010invasive and invasive techniques. Treatment of muscle involvement in systemic diseases is based on elimination of the underlying cause and supportive measures. The prognosis is usually fair if the causative disorder is effectively treatable but can be fatal in single cases if the entire musculature including the respiratory muscles is involved, in case of infection, or in case of severe rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSION: Secondary muscle manifestations of systemic diseases must be addressed and appropriately managed. Prognosis of secondary muscle disease in systemic diseases is usually fair if the underlying condition is accessible to treatment.","publish_time":"2016-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finsterer, J.; L\u00F6scher, W.

Plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing besides pathogen reduction procedures, to reduce the virus transmission risk through their products. To achieve a similar safety standard, NAT was then also introduced for labile blood components. German transfusion centres were the first to start in-house NAT testing of their donations in pools of up to 96 samples for HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Years later the diagnostics industry provided commercial HCV and HIV-1 and later HBV NAT tests on automated platforms. NAT tests for HIV-2, hepatitis A virus, and Parvovirus B19 followed, again driven by transfusion centres with their in-house tests. When severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and West Nile Virus emerged it was the NAT that enabled the manufacturers and transfusion centres to instantly introduce sensitive and specific screening tests. Subsequent automation including sample preparation has significantly reduced the costs and complexity of the procedure and made it affordable to middle income countries as well. Currently more than 60 million donations per year are NAT tested worldwide and the remaining residual risk of virus transmission by blood components and products could be reduced to almost zero. Automation rendered possible the reduction of pool size in conjunction with increased throughput and sensitivity. Thus, antibody and antigen testing may be dispensable in the long run, particularly in the combination of NAT testing with pathogen reduction. There are new technologies on the horizon like digital droplet PCR, next-generation sequencing, lab-on-a-chip, and digital antigen assays, which are comparably sensitive. However, each of these has limitations, either in throughput, costs, automation, time to result, specificity, or the need for NAT as an integral part of the technology. Thus, NAT is still the shortest and most efficient means to the result. Donor screening NAT also contributed significantly to our knowledge on how fast viruses replicate, and on the respective diagnostic window. In conjunction with animal and patient studies, we have learned more about the minimal infectious dose and the epidemics in the donor population.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roth, Willi Kurt","journal":"Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12d2e87b8795c1839f957b97ebc8c1dfd609b2b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6514489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191192/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000496749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAT","HBV NAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Donor screening NAT","in-house NAT testing","combination of NAT testing","later HBV NAT tests","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","virus transmission risk","West Nile Virus","human immunodeficiency virus","remaining residual risk of virus transmission","HIV","antigen testing","in-house tests","virus nucleic acid amplification technology","introduction of blood donor screening","infected blood products","labile blood components","specific screening tests","severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus","German transfusion centres","commercial HCV","conjunction","pathogen reduction procedures","costs","donor population","Subsequent automation","donations","result","reduction of pool size","digital antigen assays","increased throughput","digital droplet PCR","SARS-CoV","thousands of recipients","so-called AIDS","horizon","epidemics","diagnostics industry","samples","automated platforms","generation sequencing","chip","sample preparation","time","specificity","pools","long run","new technologies","middle income countries","minimal infectious dose","Parvovirus B19","Years","efficient means","animal","patient studies","sensitivity","knowledge","similar safety standard","need","antibody","manufacturers","fast viruses","respective diagnostic window","complexity","limitations","Plasma fractionators"],"language":"en"},

The questionnaire was designed to evaluate preparedness according to knowledge about virus transmission and protective measures, adherence to protection guidelines, and psychological impacts affecting doctors. Institutional factors affecting doctors\u0027 readiness like adopting approach protocols and making protection equipment available were investigated; 308 doctors from different healthcare facilities participated (response rate: 53.9%). Approximately 25% of doctors (n = 77) previously took care of COVID-19 patients, and 173 (56.2%) have institutional COVID-19 approach protocols. Only 57 doctors (18.5%) reported all PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) available. The self-reported score of preparedness to deal with COVID-19 patients was 4.9 \u00B1 2.4.

Methods Twelve subjects had physiologic monitoring and subjective perceptions monitored over 1 hour of treadmill exercise (5.6 km/h) in an environmental chamber (35\u00B0C, relative humidity 50%) wearing an N95 FFR, P100 FFR, or no respirator. Respirator quantitative fit testing was done before and after exercise. Results There was no significant difference in pass rates for both FFRs on initial fit testing, but subjects who passed were more likely to fail the postexercise test with N95 FFRs (P = .01). Wearing FFRs increased the temperature of facial skin covered by the FFR (P = .009) and breathing discomfort (P = .002).

The goal of this study is to investigate the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effect of cinnamon water extract (CWE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and its underlying intracellular mechanisms. METHODS: CWE was orally administrated to mice for 6 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Serum levels of TNF-\u03B1 and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined 1 hour after LPS stimulation. Peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-injected mice were isolated and assayed for viability, cytokine expression and signaling molecules upon LPS stimulation. CWE was further fractioned according to molecular size, and the levels of total polyphenols and biological activities of each fraction were measured. RESULTS: The oral administration of CWE to mice significantly decreased the serum levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6. CWE treatment in vitro decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-\u03B1. CWE blocked the LPS-induced degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1 as well as the activation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, size-based fractionation of CWE showed that the observed inhibitory effect of CWE in vitro occurred in the fraction containing the highest level of total polyphenols. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with CWE decreased LPS-induced TNF-\u03B1 in serum. In vitro inhibition of TNF-\u03B1 gene by CWE may occur via the modulation of I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation and JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 activation. Our results also indicate that the observed anti-inflammatory action of CWE may originate from the presence of polyphenols.","publish_time":"2012-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Joung-Woo; Yang, Ga-Eun; Kim, Yoon Bum; Eom, Seok Hyun; Lew, Jae-Hwan; Kang, Hee","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12fc7df6445be6360090621b75df383ce86772af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3533872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23190501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CWE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CWE treatment","LPS-induced TNF-\u03B1","oral administration of CWE","observed inhibitory effect of CWE","Serum levels of TNF","LPS stimulation","observed anti-inflammatory action of CWE","size-based fractionation of CWE","\u03B1 gene","inhibition of TNF","LPS-induced degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1","mRNA expression of TNF","intraperitoneal injection of LPS","levels of total polyphenols","p38","activation of JNK","ERK1","presence of polyphenols","RESULTS","highest level of total polyphenols","anti-cancer properties","thioglycollate-injected mice","modulation of I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation","inhibitory effect of cinnamon water extract","biological activities","induced tumor necrosis factor","cytokine expression","Cinnamon bark","molecular size","diverse pharmacological activities","traditional oriental medicine","lipopolysaccharide","popular herbal ingredients","viability","molecules","Peritoneal macrophages","days","interleukin","underlying intracellular mechanisms","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","hour","goal","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Global health systems are facing the unprecedented challenges. Here we shared the experiences and lessons in emergency responses and management from our hospital, a government-assigned regional anti-Covid-19 general hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail. An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established. Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out. Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced. Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed. Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced. FINDINGS: Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found. During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy. Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered. INTERPRETATION: As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.

This study demonstrates that NPCs support replication following infection by the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV). JHMV infection leads to increased cell death and dampens IFN-\u03B3-induced MHC class II expression. Importantly, cytokines secreted by CD4\u002B T cells inhibit JHMV replication in NPCs, and CD8\u002B T cells specifically target viral peptide-pulsed NPCs for lysis. Furthermore, treatment with IFN-\u03B3 inhibits JHMV replication in a dose-dependent manner.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pathak, Elizabeth Barnett; Salemi, Jason L.; Sobers, Natasha; Menard, Janelle; Hambleton, Ian R.","journal":"J Public Health Manag Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8efcaaec2c994885ac54454ab1be199aea6f6e99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282440/; https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["ill children","Estimates of total children","ill pediatric COVID","SARS-CoV","evidence-based estimates of children","pediatric severity proportions","pediatric criticality proportions","severe cases of COVID","adjusted pediatric criticality proportion","projected numbers of severe cases","United States","adjusted severity","lower severity of COVID","hospitalization","US pediatric intensive care unit","scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion","projected cumulative numbers","severe pneumonia","PICU admission","years old","available pediatric hospital care resources","moderate CPIP scenarios","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","US population data","coronavirus disease","public health preparedness efforts","hospitals","unique challenges","MEASURES","spatiotemporal modeling studies","DESIGN","Empirical case projection study","epidemic","infants","surge","MAIN OUTCOMES","toddlers younger","China","IMPORTANCE","period","OBJECTIVE","pandemic","RELEVANCE","CONCLUSIONS","PICUs","adults","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We tested 400 clinical stool samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis and compared the ICA results with the results obtained by using ELISA, enzyme-linked fluorescent assays (ELFA), PCR, and multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (mRT-PCR). To assess the analytical performance of the SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit, we determined its detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and analytical reactivity for adenovirus subtypes, and performed interference studies. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates among the tested methods were 91.5% for rotavirus and 85.5% for adenovirus. On the basis of mRT-PCR, the overall agreement, positive agreement, and negative agreement rates of the ICA were 95.6%, 100%, and 94.9% for rotavirus, and 94.0%, 71.4%, and 94.8% for adenovirus, respectively. Using the ICA, we detected all the subtypes of adenovirus tested, but the analytical reactivities for adenovirus subtypes were different between the 4 adenovirus detection methods. The high reproducibility was confirmed, and no cross-reactivity or interference was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit showed acceptable analytical and clinical performances. However, interpretation of adenovirus positive/negative result should be cautious because of different detectability for adenovirus subtypes among adenovirus detection methods.","publish_time":"2014-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jayoung; Kim, Hyun Soo; Kim, Han-Sung; Kim, Jae-Seok; Song, Wonkeun; Lee, Kyu Man; Lee, Sunhwa; Park, Kyoung Un; Lee, Woochang; Hong, Young Jun","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/722738d238370488034852a1867cfa04b564d331.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3999320.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790909/; https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2014.34.3.216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit (SD Rota/Adeno Rapid","Standard Diagnostics, Inc.","ICA","SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenovirus subtypes","subtypes of adenovirus","adenovirus detection methods","SD Rota","analytical reactivity","interpretation of adenovirus positive","SD BIOLINE Rota","Adeno Rapid kit","ICA results","tested methods","positive agreement","analytical reactivities","analytical performance","mRT-PCR","negative agreement rates","overall agreement rates","clinical performances","detection limit","cross-reactivity","clinical stool samples","simultaneous detection of rotaviruses","reverse transcription-PCR","human stool samples","different detectability","negative result","basis of mRT","interference studies","high reproducibility","acute gastroenteritis","adenoviruses","Standard Diagnostics","enzyme","fluorescent assays","patients","Korea","ELISA","ELFA","immunochromatographic assay","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of alpaca cria mortality in Peru and elsewhere. In order to develop appropriate control and/or treatment, it is necessary to identify infectious pathogens that cause diarrhea in crias. Rotavirus was isolated in cell culture from feces collected from crias with acute diarrhea that tested positive to rotaviral antigen by rapid immunochromatographic methods in an earlier study. The isolates were identified as rotaviruses by RT-PCR run with specific primers for human rotavirus VP7 coding sequences using total RNA extracted from cells displaying cytopathic effects as template. These alpaca isolates were further identified as group A rotaviruses by means of a VP6-specific PCR and were designated as ALRVA-K\u2019ayra/Per\u00FA/3368-10 and ALRVA-K\u2019ayra/Per\u00FA/3386-10. Molecular G and P typing, placed the former as G3/P11 and the latter as G3/P?. Sequence analysis of two genome segments (coding for VP4 and VP7) from the alpaca isolates revealed partial homologies to swine and human rotaviruses, respectively. These results demonstrate that rotaviruses are associated with a proportion of cases of diarrhea in crias, although prevalence and impact remain to be determined. The isolation of rotaviruses from alpaca crias with diarrhea will contribute positively to further understand the pathogen and its role in the diarrhea complex.","publish_time":"2015-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garmendia, Antonio E.; Lopez, Wellington; Ortega, Nastassja; Chamorro, Marycris J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10673a4f21c3b6d007b81bb5eefe5fbd70f3ab06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117529.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.07.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515002849; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515002849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","G3/P"],"locations":["Peru"],"keyphrases":["alpaca crias","acute diarrhea","human rotaviruses","alpaca isolates","diarrhea complex","isolation of rotaviruses","ALRVA-K\u2019ayra","Per\u00FA","G3","human rotavirus VP7 coding sequences","leading causes of alpaca cria mortality","VP6-specific PCR","specific primers","RT-PCR","infectious diseases","infectious pathogens","P typing","total RNA","rapid immunochromatographic methods","rotaviral antigen","SAC","cells","partial homologies","swine","genome segments","high morbidity","species of South American camelids","VP4","feces","Vicugna pacos","cytopathic effects","earlier study","cell culture","Peru","Sequence analysis","proportion of cases","appropriate control","treatment","Abstract Alpacas","template","Molecular G","role","prevalence","order","impact","P11","results"],"language":"en"},

Scientists have used DNA in this way to construct various amazing nanostructures, such as ordered lattices, origami, supramolecular assemblies, and even three\u2010dimensional objects. In addition, DNA has been utilized as a guide and template to direct the assembly of other nanomaterials including nanowires, free\u2010standing membranes, and crystals. Furthermore, DNA can also be used as structural components to construct bulk materials such as DNA hydrogels, demonstrating its ability to behave as a unique polymer.

However, polymerase chain reaction amplification from cDNA templates produced by reverse transcription has generally been restricted to products of less than 10 kilobases. In this paper, we report a system to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 kilobases from human coronavirus 229E genomic RNA. We demonstrate that the integrity of the RNA template and the prevention of false priming events during reverse transcription are the critical parameters to achieve the synthesis of long cDNAs. The optimization of the polymerase chain reaction conditions enabled us to improve the specificity and yield of product but they were not definitive. Finally, we have shown that the same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology can be used for the amplification of extended regions of the dystrophin mRNA, a cellular RNA of relatively low abundance.","publish_time":"1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiel, Volker; Rashtchian, Ayoub; Herold, Jens; Schuster, David M.; Guan, Nin; Siddell, Stuart G.","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3a4e8c6c078f130d118f060709cadee335b1b61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269797923071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269797923071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polymerase chain reaction amplification","polymerase chain reaction conditions","Abstract Polymerase chain reaction","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology","E genomic RNA","cellular RNA","RNA template","amplification of long DNA fragments","kilobases","amplification of extended regions","synthesis of long cDNAs","cDNA templates","prevention of false priming events","dystrophin mRNA","human coronavirus","variety of sources","critical parameters","optimization","specificity","viral DNAs","low abundance","yield of product","system","integrity","products","paper"],"language":"en"},

In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antiboy detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.

In order to advance patient safety and HH compliance, a three-pronged approach was implemented to enhance HH education, observation and measurement of HH compliance. PROJECT: Three components were implemented to improve compliance with HH practices: Education Component (Phase I) Development and implementation of a mandatory computer-based learning module on hand hygiene for all patient care staff that included HH\u0027s \u201CTop Ten List\u201D based on CDC\u0027s Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, 2002 Focused and targeted educational program for fellows, residents and mid-level providers including staff in invasive procedural areas Special educational HH program in Spanish for spanish-speaking staff Training of unit-based HH observers (100) using the Train-the-Trainer model Focus on HH compliance during Patient Safety Week Campaign in March 2005 Evaluation Component (Phase II) Three HH observational periods for assessment of HH compliance by trained HH monitors and infection control practitioners in all patient care areas Monthly self-assessment in patient care area units and diagnostic areas Communication and Feedback of Results Component (Phase III) Communication to staff, managers and administration regarding HH violations and compliance rates Prompt follow-up with re-education in patient care areas where HH violations rates were lower than expected. RESULTS: In Phase I, 100% of patient care staff complied with HH computer-based training. A total of 100 unit-based HH observers were trained using the Train-the-Trainer approach with education on HH basics, use of HH tool and feedback to colleagues and peers. In Phases II and III, observational periods with assessment of HH compliance were implemented by the trained HH observer of each clinical area. Data from observation periods, demonstrated an incremental improvement in HH practices with an initial baseline of 79% and an average of 91% in subsequent periods. LESSONS LEARNED: A coordinated systems approach that includes patient care staff, physicians, committees and administration is essential when initiating a process change. Providing education and feedback to staff and physicians will improve compliance. Identification of areas where additional education and feedback on HH is required and will also improve compliance.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez, V.

The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region.

The virus expresses proteins containing short contiguous amino acid stretches (5\u20139aa \u201Cvatches\u201D = viralmatches) homologous to APOE4, clusterin, PICALM, and complement receptor 1, and to over 100 other gene products relevant to Alzheimer\u0027s disease, which are also homologous to proteins expressed by other pathogens implicated in Alzheimer\u0027s disease. Such homology, reiterated at the DNA level, suggests that gene association studies have been tracking infection, as well as identifying key genes, demonstrating a role for pathogens as causative agents. Vatches may interfere with the function of their human counterparts, acting as dummy ligands, decoy receptors, or via interactome interference. They are often immunogenic, and antibodies generated in response to infection may target their human counterparts, producing protein knockdown, or generating autoimmune responses that may kill the neurones in which the human homologue resides, a scenario supported by immune activation in Alzheimer\u0027s disease. These data may classify Alzheimer\u0027s disease as an autoimmune disorder created by pathogen mimicry of key Alzheimer\u0027s disease-related proteins.

The aim of this experiment was to compare the pathogenicity of European avian-like swine H1N1 and European human-like reassortant swine H1N2 viruses in na\u00EFve pigs and in pigs previously infected with Mhp. Six groups of SPF pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with either Mhp, or H1N1, or H1N2 or Mhp\u002BH1N1 or Mhp\u002BH1N2, both pathogens being inoculated at 21 days intervals in these two last groups. A mock-infected group was included. Although both SIV strains induced clinical signs when singly inoculated, results indicated that the H1N2 SIV was more pathogenic than the H1N1 virus, with an earlier shedding and a greater spread in lungs. Initial infection with Mhp before SIV inoculation increased flu clinical signs and pathogenesis (hyperthermia, loss of appetite, pneumonia lesions) due to the H1N1 virus but did not modify significantly outcomes of H1N2 infection. Thus, Mhp and SIV H1N1 appeared to act synergistically, whereas Mhp and SIV H1N2 would compete, as H1N2 infection led to the elimination of Mhp in lung diaphragmatic lobes. In conclusion, SIV would be a risk factor for the severity of respiratory disorders when associated with Mhp, depending on the viral subtype involved. This experimental model of coinfection with Mhp and avian-like swine H1N1 is a relevant tool for studying the pathogenesis of SIV-associated PRDC and testing intervention strategies for the control of the disease.","publish_time":"2012-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deblanc, C.; Gorin, S.; Qu\u00E9guiner, S.; Gautier-Bouchardon, A.

Formation yields of dioxins and chlorinated triclosans were assessed at different initial precursor concentrations under dark and UV light irradiation conditions. Results showed that triclosan was rapidly transformed to its chlorinated derivatives, i.e. tetraclosans and pentaclosans, of which the formation yields peaked after 1 h of reaction. UV light was the key factor to promote the formation of dioxins. With the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, the highest yield of dioxins was observed with lower initial concentrations of triclosan under UV irradiation. Five dioxins, including 2,8-DCDD, 1,2,8-TrCDD, 2,3,7-TrCDD, 1,2,3,8-TeCDD, and 2,3,7,8-TeCDD, were identified and quantified. 2,3,7,8-TeCDD, the most toxic dioxin, was firstly reported as the photo-transformation product of triclosan in aquatic solution.

This study aims to investigate the compound\u2013target interaction network and potential pharmacological actions of isoquinoline alkaloids of M. cordata by reverse pharmacophore database screening. METHODS: The targets of 26 isoquinoline alkaloids identified from M. cordata were predicted by a pharmacophore-based target fishing approach. Discovery Studio 3.5 and two pharmacophore databases (PharmaDB and HypoDB) were employed for the target profiling. A compound\u2013target interaction network of M. cordata was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape 3.0. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 65 predicted targets identified by PharmaDB were confirmed as targets by HypoDB screening. The targets in the interaction network of M. cordata were involved in cancer (31 targets), microorganisms (12 targets), neurodegeneration (10 targets), inflammation and autoimmunity (8 targets), parasitosis (5 targets), injury (4 targets), and pain (3 targets). Dihydrochelerythrine (C6) was found to hit 23 fitting targets. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) hits 15 alkaloids (C1\u20132, C11\u201316, C19\u201325) was the most promising target related to cancer. CONCLUSION: Through in silico target fishing, the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects of M. cordata were the most significant among many possible activities. The possible anticancer effects were mainly contributed by the isoquinoline alkaloids as active components.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Qifang; Liu, Haibo; Peng, Yong; Xiao, Peigen","journal":"Chin Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb5417b7729ff5548e5b9ddcb837fa52efc586f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4683977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26691584/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-015-0067-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

Most courses have been developed in high-income countries. However, whether these courses improve the ability of health professionals to provide appropriate care in low-income countries remains unclear. This is the first update of the original review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of in-service emergency care training on health professionals\u0027 treatment of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com); MEDLINE, Ovid SP; EMBASE, Ovid SP; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge/Science and eight other databases. We performed database searches in February 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries, websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. We applied no date, language or publication status restrictions when conducting the searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted-time-series studies that compared the effects of in-service emergency care training versus usual care were eligible for inclusion. We included only hospital-based studies and excluded community-based studies. Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) for each outcome using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We described results and presented them in GRADE tables. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence). AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: In-service neonatal emergency care courses probably improve health professionals\u0027 treatment of seriously ill babies in the short term. Further multi-centre randomised trials evaluating the effects of in-service emergency care training on long-term outcomes (health professional practice and patient outcomes) are needed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In-service training for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries WHAT QUESTION WAS THE REVIEW ASKING? This is the first update of the original Cochrane review, whose objective was to find out whether additional emergency care training programmes can improve the ability of health workers in poor countries to care for seriously ill newborns and children admitted to hospitals. Researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all studies that could answer this question and found two relevant studies. WHAT ARE THE KEY MESSAGES? The review authors suggest that giving health professionals in poor countries additional training in emergency care probably improves their ability to care for seriously ill newborns. We need additional high-quality studies, including studies in which health professionals are trained to care for seriously ill older children. BACKGROUND: TRAINING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL BABIES AND CHILDREN: In poor countries, many babies and children with serious illnesses die even though they have been cared for in hospitals. One reason for this may be that health workers in these countries often are not properly trained to offer the care that these children need. In poor countries, children often become seriously ill because of conditions such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea, and may need emergency care. For newborn babies, the most common reason for emergency care is too little oxygen to the baby during birth. If this goes on for too long, the person delivering the baby has to help the baby breathe, and sometimes has to get the baby\u0027s heart rate back to normal. This is called neonatal resuscitation. Neonatal resuscitation is a skilled task, and the health worker needs proper training. As babies need to be resuscitated quickly, the health worker needs to know how to prepare for this before the baby is born. For instance, he or she needs to know how to prepare the room and proper equipment. Health workers in poor countries often do not have these skills, and these babies are likely to die. Babies can also be harmed if the health worker does not resuscitate the baby correctly. Several training programmes have been developed to teach health workers how to give emergency care to seriously ill babies and children. But most of these have been developed and tested in wealthy countries, and we don\u0027t know whether they would work in poor countries. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN POOR COUNTRIES ARE GIVEN EXTRA TRAINING? The review authors found two relevant studies. These studies compared the practices of health professionals who had been given extra training in the care of newborns with the practices of health professionals who did not receive extra training. In the first study, nurses at a maternity hospital in Kenya completed a one-day training course on how to resuscitate newborn babies. This course was adapted from the UK Resuscitation Council, and it included lectures and practical training. The study suggests that after these training courses: health professionals are probably more likely to resuscitate newborn babies correctly (moderate certainty of the evidence); and newborn babies may be less likely to die while being resuscitated (low certainty of the evidence). In the second study, doctors, nurses and midwives in five Sri Lankan hospitals were given a four-day training course on how to prepare for and provide care for newborns. This course was adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Training Modules on Essential Newborn Care and Breastfeeding, and included lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. This study suggests that after these training courses: health professionals probably are more likely to be well prepared to resuscitate newborn babies (moderate certainty of the evidence). Unfortunately, the two studies followed up with health professionals for only two to three months after they received training. We therefore don\u0027t know if the benefits of the training courses lasted over time. The review authors found no studies that looked at the effects of training programmes on the care of older children. HOW UP-TO-DATE IS THIS REVIEW? Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to February 2015.","publish_time":"2015-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opiyo, Newton; English, Mike","journal":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/737650f6ab6664da7582430d4b45ff9dd2e76866.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4463987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd007071.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Cochrane Library","Ovid SP","Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information","ISI","Knowledge/Science","UK Resuscitation Council","World Health Organization","Essential Newborn Care"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["appropriate care","Organisation of Care","quality of care","vs usual care","effects of in-service emergency care training","essential newborn care training","In-service neonatal emergency care courses","variety of in-service emergency care training courses","In-service training","certainty of evidence","newborn resuscitation training","delivery room newborn care practices","usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation","low-income countries","moderate certainty evidence","review authors","original review","low certainty evidence","ill newborns","new studies","selected studies","Cochrane Library","non-randomised trials","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","health professionals\u0027 treatment","children","hospital-based studies","review eligibility criteria","high-income countries","update","multi-centre randomised trials","health professional practice","ability of health professionals","Cochrane Effective Practice","time-series studies","inappropriate resuscitation","ill babies","risk ratio","excluded community-based studies","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","trained mean","Science Citation Index","Ovid SP","inclusion","database searches","study risk of bias","clinical trial registries","Social Sciences Citation Index","long-term outcomes","assessment of breathing","patient outcomes","mean difference","confidence interval","effect estimates","neonatal mortality","DATA COLLECTION","SELECTION CRITERIA","GRADE tables","MAIN RESULTS","Group Specialised Register","PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY","reference lists of related reviews","websites of relevant organisations","Scientific Information","Institute","ISI","EPOC","EMBASE","preparedness","Grades of Recommendation","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","Web of Knowledge","publication status restrictions","MEDLINE","Development","ANALYSIS","deaths","QUESTION","Evaluation","short term","BACKGROUND","databases","SEARCH METHODS","strategy","Findings","OBJECTIVES","TRAINING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS","EXTRA TRAINING","practices of health professionals","training courses","proper training","poor countries additional training","Training Modules","hands-on training","practical training","ILL BABIES","newborn babies","care of newborns","additional emergency care training programmes","ability of health workers","day training course","Essential Newborn Care","World Health Organization","wealthy countries","ill older children","relevant studies","study","additional high-quality studies","evidence","moderate certainty","neonatal resuscitation","nurses","lectures","original Cochrane review","low certainty","Sri Lankan hospitals","UK Resuscitation Council","common reason","Cochrane Collaboration","proper equipment","midwives","demonstrations","Breastfeeding","little oxygen","Kenya","skilled task","small group discussions","pneumonia","maternity hospital","objective","conditions","diarrhoea","baby\u0027s heart rate","meningitis","birth","doctors","serious illnesses","question","skills","room","Researchers","months","KEY MESSAGES","person","instance","studies","effects of training programmes","care of older children","benefits","time"],"language":"en"},

This response requires pDC-intrinsic MyD88-dependent signaling by Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9. Provided that they express appropriate recognition receptors such as Ly49H, NK cells can directly sense and kill MCMV-infected cells. The loss of any one of these responses increases susceptibility to infection. However, the relative importance of these antiviral immune responses and how they are related remain unclear. In humans, while IFN-I responses are essential, MyD88 is dispensable for antiviral immunity. Hence, a higher redundancy has been proposed in the mechanisms promoting protective immune responses against systemic infections by herpes viruses during natural infections in humans. It has been assumed, but not proven, that mice fail to mount protective MyD88-independent IFN-I responses. In humans, the mechanism that compensates MyD88 deficiency has not been elucidated. To address these issues, we compared resistance to MCMV infection and immune responses between mouse strains deficient for MyD88, the IFN-I receptor and/or Ly49H. We show that selective depletion of pDC or genetic deficiencies for MyD88 or TLR9 drastically decreased production of IFN-I, but not the protective antiviral responses. Moreover, MyD88, but not IFN-I receptor, deficiency could largely be compensated by Ly49H-mediated antiviral NK cell responses. Thus, contrary to the current dogma but consistent with the situation in humans, we conclude that, in mice, in our experimental settings, MyD88 is redundant for IFN-I responses and overall defense against a systemic herpes virus infection. Moreover, we identified direct NK cell sensing of infected cells as one mechanism able to compensate for MyD88 deficiency in mice. Similar mechanisms likely contribute to protect MyD88- or IRAK4-deficient patients from viral infections.","publish_time":"2015-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cocita, Cl\u00E9ment; Guiton, Rachel; Bessou, Gilles; Chasson, Lionel; Boyron, Marilyn; Crozat, Karine; Dalod, Marc","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/166142fd39f6000cf789299a7df7fedc36b300cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4425567.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25954804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCMV","Toll-Like Receptors","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MyD88 deficiency","protective MyD88-independent IFN","antiviral immune responses","protective antiviral responses","protective immune responses","antiviral NK cell responses","NK cells","MCMV infection","mice","humans","pDC-intrinsic MyD88-dependent","MCMV-infected cells","systemic infections","decreased production of IFN","natural infections","Ly49H","systemic herpes virus infection","herpes viruses","viral infections","direct NK cell sensing of infected cells","antiviral immunity","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","resistance","mouse strains deficient","selective depletion of pDC","mouse Cytomegalovirus","natural killer","mechanism able","Similar mechanisms","IRAK4-deficient patients","appropriate recognition receptors","genetic deficiencies","overall defense","TLR9","major source of type","experimental settings","current dogma","situation","Toll","relative importance","pDCs","issues","susceptibility","higher redundancy","loss"],"language":"en"},

The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.","publish_time":"1992-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blok, J.; McWilliam, S.

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. METHODS: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u0027s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (\u003E13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ \u002B azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ \u002B amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of \u22652.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. RESULTS: Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29\u20132.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80\u20134.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ \u002B azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80\u20137.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H.; Brown, Joshua D.","journal":"Res Social Adm Pharm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa9614e16685e241014d6cfa748576eb83ff777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166303.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120303910?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120303910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QT","Torsades de Pointes","HCQ/CQ","TdP/QT","FAERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TdP","QT prolongation events","exposures of HCQ","combined HCQ","CQ use","control events","control of amoxicillin","QT segment prolongation","azithromycin group","potential safety signals","death","potential risks","analysis of FAERS data","Risks of treatment","total reports","Proportional Reporting Ratios","comparative pharmacovigilance analysis","Drug Administration\u0027s Adverse Event Reporting System","Food","Torsades","Pointes","injuries","accidents","uncontrolled clinical trials","depression","Combinations of hydroxychloroquine","confidence intervals","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Lower95CIs","CONCLUSIONS","COVID","Queries","METHODS","lower limit","value","PRRs","treatments","caution"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, current diagnostic tests do not reliably distinguish between Mp infection and carriage. We previously determined that the measurement of Mp-specific immunoglobulin M antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) by enzyme-linked immunospot assay allowed for differentiation between infection and carriage. Using this new diagnostic test, we aimed to identify clinical and laboratory features associated with Mp infection. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of children, 3\u201318 years of age, with CAP from 2016 to 2017. Clinical features and biomarkers were compared between Mp-positive and -negative groups by Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) differences and optimal thresholds were determined by using the DeLong test and Youden J statistic, respectively. RESULTS: Of 63 CAP patients, 29 were Mp-positive (46%). Mp positivity was statistically associated with older age (median, 8.6 vs 4.7 years), no underlying disease, family with respiratory symptoms, prior antibiotic treatment, prolonged prodromal respiratory symptoms and fever, and extrapulmonary (skin) manifestations. Lower levels of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and procalcitonin (PCT), specifically PCT \u003C0.25 \u03BCg/L, were statistically associated with Mp infection. A combination of age \u003E5 years (AUC = 0.77), prodromal fever and respiratory symptoms \u003E6 days (AUC = 0.79), and PCT \u003C0.25 \u03BCg/L (AUC = 0.81) improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.90) (P = .05).

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. METHODS: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. RESULTS: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.; Aznaouridis, Sokratis I.; Tzani, Mpesiana A.","journal":"J Med Biol Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d017e09e5d0f1882e569222068ca72bdfa6b216.json; document_parses/pdf_json/642f8a2b908e954e00ce74f5c44ebe4e1ce46505.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221329.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-020-00529-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412551/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00338v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of COVID","X-ray images","classification accuracy","emerged COVID","spread of COVID","non-Covid","scratch","medical images","classification task","training CNNs","X-ray imaging potential","problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases","excellent results","classes","training MobileNet v2","reliable methods","extracted features","accurate detection","medical experts","remarkable method","Deep Learning","related tasks","transfer learning techniques","massive high-dimensional features","state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network","Mobile Net","examination","paper","exposure","specific visualizations","vital biomarkers","importance","study","Specificity","large-scale dataset","outbreak","X-rays","Sensitivity","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, two genetic variants of the ST3GAL1 gene, which encodes the Sia\u03B12-3Gal\u03B21- receptor to which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus binds for entry into the host cell, were investigated in an admixed Brazilian population. First, the six exons encoding the ST3GAL1 gene were sequenced in 68 patients infected with strain A(H1N1)pdm09. In a second phase of the study, the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms identified in this sample were genotyped in a sample of 356 subjects from the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil with a diagnosis of pandemic influenza. Functional analysis of the polymorphisms was performed in silico and the influence of these variants on the severity of infection was evaluated. The results suggest that rs113350588 and rs1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function. In the study the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium in the population studied (D\u2019 = 0.65).

In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US.

Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrera, Maritza; Garrido-Haro, Ana; Vaca, Mar\u00EDa S.; Granda, Danilo; Acosta-Batallas, Alfredo; P\u00E9rez, Lester J.","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71afb4cf84163bef90c7ea2f8d816aef07582d85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5742880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2978718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29379796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S"],"locations":["Mexico","United States","US","China","Ecuador","Chile"],"keyphrases":["Chinese PEDV strains","Ecuador","introduction of PEDV","PEDV genogroup","analysis of PEDV field sequences","PEDV S gene sequences available","putative route of PEDV","classical strains","sequences of isolates","complete S gene sequences","Mexico","Canada","phylogeographic study","United States","new Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","present study","Bayesian phylogeographic inference","emergence","GenBank database","Phylogenetic comparisons","live swine","main way","sources of imports","intercontinental transmission","world","China","PED-outbreak","emergent nature","origin","clade","movement of pigs","Korea","Chile"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Examine the time to clinical improvement, risk of clinical worsening after improvement, and develop discharge criteria. DESIGN: Prospective multiyear cohort study. SETTING: Sixteen US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive hospitalized children age \u003C2 years with bronchiolitis. MEASUREMENT: We defined clinical improvement using: (1) retraction severity, (2) respiratory rate, (3) room air oxygen saturation, and (4) hydration status. After meeting improvement criteria, children were considered clinically worse based on the inverse of \u22651 of these criteria or need for intensive care. RESULTS: Among 1916 children, the median number of days from onset of difficulty breathing until clinical improvement was 4 (interquartile range, 3\u20137.5 days). Of the total, 1702 (88%) met clinical improvement criteria, with 4% worsening (3% required intensive care). Children who worsened were age \u003C2 months (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07\u20105.94), gestational age \u003C37 weeks (AOR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.13\u20103.32), and presented with severe retractions (AOR: 5.55; 95% CI: 2.12\u201014.50), inadequate oral intake (AOR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.39\u20104.62), or apnea (AOR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.45\u20105.68).

Methods In this narrative review, we focus on the prevention of MERS-CoV. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: \u2018MERS\u2019, \u2018MERS-CoV\u2019, \u2018Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2019 in combination with \u2018prevention\u2019 or \u2018infection control\u2019. We also reviewed the references of each article to further include other studies or reports not identified by the search. Results As of Nov 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were diagnosed mostly from Middle Eastern regions with a mortality rate of at least 35%. A major outbreak that occurred outside the Middle East (in South Korea) and infections reported from 27 countries. MERS-CoV has gained recognition as a pathogen of global significance. Prevention of MERS-CoV infection is a global public health priority. Healthcare facility transmission and by extension community transmission, the main amplifier of persistent outbreaks, can be prevented through early identification and isolation of infected humans. While MERS-CoV vaccine studies were initially hindered by multiple challenges, recent vaccine development for MERS-CoV is showing promise. Conclusions The main factors leading to sustainability of MERS-CoV infection in high risk courtiers is healthcare facility transmission.

In old age, high metallothionein (I\u002BII) (MT) sequesters a substantial number of intracellular zinc ions consequently leading to low zinc ion bioavailability for an adequate immune response. Corticosterone and IL-6 affect MTmRNA induction in inflammation and after pHx against oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by MT in conferring immune plasticity in ageing and in very old age using the pHx model. 48 h after their partial hepatectomy, the crude zinc balance was negative in young, old and very old mice coupled with increased MT, corticosterone, sIL-6R and IL-6. Concomitantly, Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and IL-2 production decreased. Complete restoration of the nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune parameters occurred 15 days from the surgical procedures in young and very old mice, but not in old or transgenic mice overexpressing MT. A significant positive or inverse correlation among nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune parameters exists in young and very old mice, but not in old mice during liver regeneration. Since MT also affects c-myc, the gene expression of c-myc declines from 48 h to days 7 and 15 after pHx in young and very old mice, but remains constantly high in old pHx mice for the same days. This circumstance leads to the appearance of tumours in the long run in old pHx mice and survival times that are shorter than old sham controls. Because complete remodelling also occurs in IL-6 and in sIL-6R in very old mice during liver regeneration, the pre-existing inflammation is not detrimental in very old age. As such, very old mice are still responsive to large inflammation, such as pHx, thanks to correct MT homeostasis. Correct MT homeostasis, via c-myc, is therefore pivotal in both suitable liver regeneration and in conferring immune plasticity with subsequent successful ageing. High MT plays an extremely harmful role in ageing: on one hand it lowers zinc ion bioavailability levels required for immune efficiency and on the other hand it increases c-myc expression. The combination of immune depression and enhanced c-myc, via high MT, may trigger the appearance of age-related degenerative diseases.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cipriano, Catia; Giacconi, Robertina; Muzzioli, Mario; Gasparini, Nazzarena; Orlando, Fiorenza; Corradi, Attilio; Cabassi, Enrico; Mocchegiani, Eugenio","journal":"Mechanisms of Ageing and Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4661452a4d36b1af6b81af21003cfa499dd5bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126870.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0047637403001465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637403001465","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["old mice","old pHx mice","old age","hepatectomised mice","transgenic mice","High MT","old sham controls","immune parameters","immune plasticity","pHx model","increased MT","c-myc expression","correct MT homeostasis","impaired immune efficiency","enhanced c-myc","adequate immune response","combination of immune depression","myc declines","suitable liver regeneration","study of inflammation","days","gene expression of c","pre-existing inflammation","large inflammation","high metallothionein","subsequent successful ageing","low zinc ion bioavailability","zinc ion bioavailability levels","surgical procedures","nutritional","partial hepatectomy","crude zinc balance","hand","Corticosterone","sIL","substantial number of intracellular zinc ions","appearance of tumours","good model","harmful role","Complete restoration","complete remodelling","appearance of age-related degenerative diseases","survival times","long run","cell activity","inverse correlation","affect MTmRNA induction","thanks","Natural Killer","similarity","production","oxidative damage","circumstance","Abstract","aim"],"language":"en"},

In a few months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused thousands of disease cases and deaths in several countries. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoV in the Sarbecovirus subgenus and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 were identified from bats and pangolins. Coronaviruses have long and complex genomes with high plasticity in terms of gene content. To date, the coding potential of SARS-CoV-2 remains partially unknown. We thus used available sequences of bat and pangolin viruses to determine the selective events that shaped the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess its coding potential. By searching for signals of significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites (dS), we identified six genomic regions, one of these corresponding to the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift. The most prominent signal of dS reduction was observed within the E gene. A genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures indicated that this region harbors a putative functional RNA element that is shared with the SARS-CoV lineage. Additional signals of reduced dS indicated the presence of internal ORFs. Whereas the presence ORF9a (internal to N) was previously proposed by homology with a well characterized protein of SARS-CoV, ORF3h (for hypothetical, within ORF3a) was not previously described. The predicted product of ORF3h has 90% identity with the corresponding predicted product of SARS-CoV and displays features suggestive of a viroporin. Finally, analysis of the putative ORF10 revealed high dN/dS (3.82) in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In the SARS-CoV lineage, the ORF is predicted to encode a truncated protein and is neutrally evolving. These data suggest that ORF10 encodes a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is driving its evolution. Experimental analyses will be necessary to validate and characterize the coding and non-coding functional elements we identified.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36803e44aaa6fb1751ebc73985cd21d27e3857ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199688.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301842?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820301842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104353","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV lineage","coding potential of SARS","characterized protein of SARS","genome structure of SARS","corresponding predicted product of SARS","functional protein","predicted product of ORF3h","Additional signals of reduced dS","non-coding functional elements","putative functional RNA element","putative ORF10","truncated protein","related coronaviruses","prominent signal of dS reduction","presence of internal ORFs","high plasticity","pangolin viruses","high dN","reduced variability","genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures","presence ORF9a","E gene","Phylogenetic analyses","Experimental analyses","terms of gene content","complex genomes","selective events","identity","Sarbecovirus subgenus","synonymous sites","novel human-infecting coronavirus","deaths","thousands of disease cases","available sequences of bat","clusters","countries","homology","positive selection","hypothetical","date","ribosomal frameshift","genomic regions","evolution","ORF3a","data","bats","months","pangolins","viroporin","China"],"language":"en"},

Enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of Ly6G(hi)Ly6C(int) neutrophils, and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Reciprocally, depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal LPS reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication. This discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after C. albicans and influenza A virus infection. Thus, positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity.","publish_time":"2014-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Tony T.; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Clark, Dayna R.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Way, Sing Sing","journal":"Mucosal Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/433adf76ea9adc9f5c540d4c28142d4d020969e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4465067.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2014.119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25492473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Commensal enteric bacteria","commensal bacteria control responsiveness","antifungal immunity","commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection","commensal bacteria replete control mice","positive calibration of antiviral immunity","localized infection","infection susceptibility","virus infection","systemic immune responsiveness","immune components","antifungal protective benefits","disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection","viruses","specific immune cell subsets","pathogen-specific CD8","extra-intestinal tissues","pathogen types","infected tissues","depletion of neutrophils","intestinal LPS reconstitution","robust systemic expansion of Ly6G","intrinsic differences","expanded levels","antibiotic","mobilization","restrained activation","broader applicability","Ly6C","T cells","pathogenic microbes","influenza","sharp contrast","discordance"],"language":"en"},

In the field of tropical medicine and health, a well-conducted systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) is considered a feasible solution for keeping clinicians abreast of current evidence-based medicine. Understanding of SR/MA steps is of paramount importance for its conduction. It is not easy to be done as there are obstacles that could face the researcher. To solve those hindrances, this methodology study aimed to provide a step-by-step approach mainly for beginners and junior researchers, in the field of tropical medicine and other health care fields, on how to properly conduct a SR/MA, in which all the steps here depicts our experience and expertise combined with the already well-known and accepted international guidance.

Replication organelles (ROs) are membranous structures that not only harbor viral proteins but also contain a specific array of hijacked host factors that create a unique lipid microenvironment optimal for genome replication. While some lipids may be locally synthesized de novo, other lipids are shuttled towards ROs. In picornavirus-infected cells, lipids are exchanged at membrane contact sites between ROs and other organelles.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data for LRI and its specific etiologic factors, including pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. We used modeling methods to estimate incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We calculated burden attributable to known risk factors for LRI. RESULTS: In 2015, LRIs were the fourth-leading cause of DALYs, causing 11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095\u201312,396,566) DALYs and 191,114 (95% UI 170,934\u2013210,705) deaths. The LRI DALY rates were higher than global estimates in 2015. The highest and lowest age-standardized rates of DALYs were observed in Somalia and Lebanon, respectively. Undernutrition in childhood and ambient particulate matter air pollution in the elderly were the main risk factors.

The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (\u00B1SD) age of 52 \u00B1 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 1010 cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when \u22651 cm2 of lung consolidation was observed and \u22656 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions \u22651 cm2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if \u22652 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 \u00B1 28, CON: 96 \u00B1 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holschbach, C. L.; Raabis, S. M.; Ollivett, T.

Participants were followed for development of clinical respiratory illness (CRI). Symptomatic subjects were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenza type B by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results The rate of bacterial colonization was 2.8% in the N95 group (p=0.02), 5.3% among medical mask users (p\u003C0.01) and 7.5% among the controls (p=0.16). N95 respirators were significantly protective (adjusted RR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21\u20130.56) against bacterial colonization.

Although vaccines have generally proven to be safe, safety issues have arisen that have resulted in some members of the public having a poor perception of vaccines. However, the technological advances made in recent years make the development of even safer vaccines a possibility. The new generation of vaccines will be based on pure recombinant proteins, conjugates and killed viruses.

Here, we used RBD-Fc, a fusion protein containing the RBD and human IgG1 Fc, as a model in the studies and found that a single amino acid substitution in the RBD (R441A) could abolish the immunogenicity of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits. With a panel of anti-RBD mAbs as probes, we observed that R441A substitution was able to disrupt the majority of neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, suggesting that this residue is critical for the antigenic structure responsible for inducing protective immune responses. We also demonstrated that the RBD-Fc bearing R441A mutation could not bind to soluble and cell-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and failed to block S protein-mediated pseudovirus entry, indicating that this point mutation also disrupted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the RBD.

Nanobodies (Nbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids and sharks and are potentially cost-effective antivirals with small size and great expression yield. In this study, we developed a novel neutralizing Nb (NbMS10) and its human-Fc-fused version (NbMS10-Fc), both of which target the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We further tested their receptor-binding affinity, recognizing epitopes, cross-neutralizing activity, half-life, and efficacy against MERS-CoV infection. Both Nbs can be expressed in yeasts with high yield, bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, and block the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the MERS-CoV receptor. The binding site of the Nbs on the RBD was mapped to be around residue Asp539, which is part of a conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface. NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc maintained strong cross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. Particularly, NbMS10-Fc had significantly extended half-life in vivo; a single-dose treatment of NbMS10-Fc exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy by completely protecting humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Overall, this study proves the feasibility of producing cost-effective, potent, and broad-spectrum Nbs against MERS-CoV and has produced Nbs with great potentials as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic development is critical for preventing and treating continual MERS-CoV infections in humans and camels. Because of their small size, nanobodies (Nbs) have advantages as antiviral therapeutics (e.g., high expression yield and robustness for storage and transportation) and also potential limitations (e.g., low antigen-binding affinity and fast renal clearance). Here, we have developed novel Nbs that specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein. They bind to a conserved site on MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, blocking RBD\u0027s binding to MERS-CoV receptor. Through engineering a C-terminal human Fc tag, the in vivo half-life of the Nbs is significantly extended. Moreover, the Nbs can potently cross-neutralize the infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. The Fc-tagged Nb also completely protects humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Taken together, our study has discovered novel Nbs that hold promise as potent, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.","publish_time":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Guangyu; He, Lei; Sun, Shihui; Qiu, Hongjie; Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jiawei; Li, Jiangfan; Chen, Yuehong; Guo, Yan; Wang, Yufei; Shang, Jian; Ji, Kaiyuan; Fan, Ruiwen; Du, Enqi; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Fang; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69dfbde6c5ed2f0c93261cf763e206f0f3d63132.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6146697.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00837-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nbs","RBD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RBD","MERS-CoV receptor","binding of MERS","anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics","lethal MERS-CoV challenge","divergent MERS-CoV strains","continual MERS-CoV infections","MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain","infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains","broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents","NbMS10-Fc","broad-spectrum Nbs","novel Nbs","receptor-binding affinity","receptor-binding interface","binding site","high affinity","RBD\u0027s binding","human-Fc","high yield","humans","camels","low antigen-binding affinity","high expression yield","high prophylactic","study","novel neutralizing Nb","cost-effective antivirals","therapeutic efficacy","single-dose treatment of NbMS10","extended half-life","C-terminal human Fc tag","great expression yield","humanized mice","activity","single-domain antibodies","broad-spectrum strategies","strong cross","small size","conserved site","Nanobodies","IMPORTANCE Therapeutic development","great potentials","antiviral therapeutics","conserved conformational epitope","emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","storage","transportation","sharks","camelids","fast renal clearance","robustness","fused version","epitopes","potential limitations","engineering","advantages","feasibility","yeasts","spread","residue Asp539"],"language":"en"},

Despite advances in antimicrobial therapies, microbiological diagnostic tests and prevention measures, pneumonia remains the main cause of death from infectious disease in the world. An important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases, along with the increasing age of the population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganism. The increasing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, difficult-to-treat microorganisms, and the emergence of new pathogens are a major problem for clinicians when deciding antimicrobial therapy. A key factor for managing and effectively guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an understanding of the role of the different causative microorganisms in the etiology of pneumonia, since it has been shown that the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy is a key factor for prognosis in pneumonia. Furthermore, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies are sometimes given until microbiological results are available and de-escalation cannot be performed quickly.

Tracheal swab samples were collected from 170 Broiler flocks during 2017. Ten tracheal swabs from each flock pooled. From a total number of 170 flocks tested, 84.71% found to be positive. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed the presence of D274 as a first time in Iran. IS/1494/06 was showed to be dominant IBV type circulating in broiler farms with a significantly higher prevalence than other four genotypes. Considering fluctuations in QX-type prevalence in recent years, continuous monitoring is necessary to reduce economic consequences in layer and broiler farms. The findings highlight the importance of using modified vaccination strategies that are adapted to the changing disease scenario.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Hosseini, Hossein; Fallah Mehrabadi, Mohammad Hossein; Ghafouri, Seyed Ali; Modiri Hamdan, Amir; Ziafati, Zahra; Esmaeelzadeh Dizaji, Reza; Mohammadi, Peyman","journal":"Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52467f330dbc2d3ec0e98abd1ac58eb15a9b6aa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112693.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2019.05.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957119300906; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957119300906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["broiler farms","Broiler flocks","QX-type prevalence","dominant IBV type","poultry farms","meat-type","Iran","economic consequences","recent years","economic threats","genetic analysis","higher prevalence","tracheal swabs","evolution of recent IBVs","Phylogenetic tree analysis","Tracheal swab samples","continuous monitoring","coronavirus avian Infectious bronchitis virus","hypervariable nucleotide sequences of S1 gene","presence of D274","layer","importance","performance","modified vaccination strategies","time","egg","fluctuations","changing disease scenario","findings","total number","genotypes","birds"],"language":"en"},

Association studies are the main tool for exploring common genetic variations underlying ALI susceptibility and/or outcome. We aimed to assess the quality of positive genetic association studies with ALI susceptibility and/or outcome in adults in order to highlight their consistency and major limitations. METHODS: We conducted a broad PubMed literature search from 1996 to June 2008 for original articles in English supporting a positive association (P \u2264 0.05) of genetic variants contributing to all-cause ALI susceptibility and/or outcome. Studies were evaluated based on current recommendations using a 10-point quality scoring system derived from 14 criteria, and the gene was considered as the unit of replication. Genes were also categorized according to biological processes using the Gene Ontology. RESULTS: Our search identified a total of 29 studies reporting positive findings for 16 genes involved mainly in the response to external stimulus and cell signal transduction. The genes encoding for interleukin-6, mannose-binding lectin, surfactant protein B, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were the most replicated across the studies. On average, the studies had an intermediate quality score (median of 4.62 and interquartile range of 3.33 to 6.15). CONCLUSIONS: Although the quality of association studies seems to have improved over the years, more and better designed studies, including the replication of previous findings, with larger sample sizes extended to population groups other than those of European descent, are needed for identifying firm genetic modifiers of ALI.","publish_time":"2008-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flores, Carlos; del Mar Pino-Yanes, Maria; Villar, Jes\u00FAs","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6783ff6a7398428f7a6bb894d39c44746b85cf73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2592769.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/cc7098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["Association"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of association studies","quality of positive genetic association studies","positive association","better designed studies","genetic variants","firm genetic modifiers of ALI","genetic factors","outcome","Genes","all-cause ALI susceptibility","positive findings","common genetic variations","intermediate quality score","quality scoring system","replication of previous findings","development of acute lung injury","unit of replication","Gene Ontology","phenomenon of acute diffuse lung inflammation","broad PubMed literature search","evidence","larger sample sizes","surfactant protein B","animal models","ill patients","main tool","population groups","mannose-binding lectin","external stimulus","Clinical observations","response","median","English","total","cell signal transduction","consistency","angiotensin","INTRODUCTION","order","criteria","adults","biological processes","original articles","enzyme","European descent","interleukin","years","major limitations","interquartile range","current recommendations","METHODS","RESULTS","average","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Participants: Ten patients with AIP who presented with idiopathic ARDS and showed diffuse alveolar damage on surgical lung biopsy specimens from July 1995 to March 2004. Measurements and results: The median age of patients was 65.5 years (age range, 38 to 73 years). Patients presented with a median duration of severe dyspnea of 9.5 days (range, 2 to 34 days) at the hospital visit. All patients required mechanical ventilation beginning at median time of hospital day 1 (range, hospital day 0 to 5), which continued for a median duration of 9.5 days (range, 4 to 98 days). Patients received ventilation in the pressure assist-control mode with a median tidal volume of 6.97 mL/kg (range, 6.05 to 8.86 mL/kg) and median positive end-expiratory pressure of 11 cm H2O (range, 8 to 16 cm H2O).

Currently, there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from PEDV. The N-terminal subunit of spike protein (S1) is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes. Thus, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows. METHODS: Affinity tagged PEDV S1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast, insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system. Purified recombinant protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and deglycosylation assay. A pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing. PEDV-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization assays. Piglets were challenged orally with PEDV, and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of three eukaryotic expression systems tested (yeast, insect-cell, and mammalian), expression by HEK-293 T cells gave the highest yield of protein that was N-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination. Administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of S1-specific IgG and IgA that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets. Also, high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets. After PEDV challenge, piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow. However, there were no significant differences in diarrhea, body weight and virus shedding.

We investigated the role and distribution of viruses in adult with severe HAP who required intensive care. METHODS: From March 2010 to February 2012, adult patients with severe HAP required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), 28-bed medical ICU in a tertiary care hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or shell vial culture. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were enrolled and 107 patients (40.8%) underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis. One hundred and fifty-six patients (59.5%) had bacterial infections and 59 patients (22.5%) had viral infections. Viruses were detected in BAL fluid specimens of 37 patients (62.7%, 37/59). The most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (both 27.1%, 16/59), followed by rhinovirus (25.4%, 15/59), and influenza virus (16.9%, 10/59). Twenty-one patients (8.0%, 21/262) had bacterial-viral coinfections and Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly coexisting bacteria (n = 10). Viral infection in non-immunocompromised patients was not uncommon (11.1%, 16/143), although it was not as frequent as that in immunocompromised patients (36.4%, 43/119). Non-immunocompromised patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients and had significantly higher rates of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculous destroyed lung and chronic kidney disease. The 28 day mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral infections and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different (29.5%, 35.6% and 19.0%, respectively; p = 0.321). CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens are not uncommon in adult patients with severe HAP who required ICU admission. Since viral pathogens may cause severe HAP and could be a potential source of viral transmission, further investigation is required to delineate the role of viral pathogens in severe HAP.","publish_time":"2014-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Hyo-Lim; Hong, Sang-Bum; Ko, Gwang-Beom; Huh, Jin Won; Sung, Heungsup; Do, Kyung-Hyun; Kim, Sung-Han; Lee, Sang-Oh; Kim, Mi-Na; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Lim, Chae-Man; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Koh, Younsuck; Choi, Sang-Ho","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98bc863e44dea730a7952a8b6bc62292fe5da07a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3994115.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752070/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095865","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAP","ICU","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult patients","viral infections","non-immunocompromised patients","severe HAP","bacterial-viral coinfections","day mortalities of patients","role of viral pathogens","bacterial infections","potential source of viral transmission","Respiratory viruses","ICU admission","important causes of severe hospital","identified viruses","distribution of viruses","tertiary care hospital","intensive care unit","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","chronic kidney disease","bed medical ICU","bronchoscopic BAL","higher rates of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","BAL fluid specimens","tuberculous destroyed lung","multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","Staphylococcus aureus","shell vial culture","hematologic malignancy","transplant recipients","investigation","pneumonia","coexisting bacteria","etiologic diagnosis","total","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

Conversion of forest to agricultural production generally results in patches of habitat that subdivide or isolate populations, alter the behavior of species, modify interspecific interactions, reduce biodiversity, and compromise ecosystem processes. Moreover, conversion may increase exposure of humans to zoonoses to which they would otherwise rarely be exposed. We evaluated the effects of forest conversion to agriculture, and its subsequent successional dynamics, on bat communities in a region of the Amazon that was predominantly closed-canopy rainforest. Based on a nonmanipulative experiment, we quantified differences in species composition, community structure, and taxonomic biodiversity among closed-canopy forest (bosque), agricultural lands (chacra), and secondary forest (purma) for two phyllostomid guilds (frugivores and gleaning animalivores) during the wet and dry seasons. Responses were complex and guild-specific. For frugivores, species composition (species abundance distributions) differed between all possible pairs of habitats in both wet and dry seasons. For gleaning animalivores, species composition differed between all possible pairs of habitats in the dry season, but no differences characterized the wet season. Ecological structure (rank abundance distributions) differed among habitats in guild-specific and season-specific manners. For frugivores, mean diversity, evenness, and dominance were greater in bosque than in purma; mean dominance was greater in bosque than in chacra, but local rarity was greater in chacra than in bosque, and no differences were manifest between purma and chacra. For gleaning animalivores, mean diversity and evenness were greater in bosque than in purma, but no differences were manifest between chacra and bosque, or between purma and chacra. Such results have important implications for management, conservation, and the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. La actual modificaci\u00F3n del paisaje, a escalas que van de lo local a lo global, es una de las amenazas m\u00E1s severas a la biodiversidad. De manera general, la conversi\u00F3n de bosques a \u00E1reas agr\u00EDcolas produce parches de h\u00E1bitat que subdividen o a\u00EDslan poblaciones, alteran la conducta de las especies, modifican las interacciones interespec\u00EDficas, reducen la biodiversidad y comprometen las funciones de los ecosistemas. M\u00E1s a\u00FAn, la transformaci\u00F3n de estos ambientes puede incrementar la probabilidad de que las poblaciones humanas interact\u00FAen con zoonosis con las que de otra manera raramente entrar\u00EDan en contacto. Evaluamos los efectos de la conversi\u00F3n de h\u00E1bitat en comunidades de murci\u00E9lagos en una regi\u00F3n de Amazonia en la que la vegetaci\u00F3n dominante es un bosque lluvioso de copas cerradas, y en la cual los efectos de la conversi\u00F3n a usos agr\u00EDcolas sobre la biodiversidad, y la subsecuente din\u00E1mica sucesional, son a\u00FAn poco comprendidos. Por medio de un experimento no-manipulativo, cuantificamos las diferencias en composici\u00F3n de especies, estructura de la comunidad y diversidad taxon\u00F3mica entre bosque cerrado (bosque), \u00E1reas agr\u00EDcolas (chacra) y bosque secundario (purma) para dos gremios tr\u00F3ficos de murci\u00E9lagos filost\u00F3midos (frug\u00EDvoros y forrajeadores de sustrato) durante dos temporadas (secas y lluvias). Las respuestas fueron complejas y diferentes para cada gremio. Para los frug\u00EDvoros, la composici\u00F3n de especies (distribuci\u00F3n de las abundancias) fue diferente para todos los posibles pares de h\u00E1bitats tanto para secas como para lluvias. Para los forrajeadores de sustrato, la composici\u00F3n de especies difiri\u00F3 entre todos los posibles pares de h\u00E1bitats en la temporada seca, pero no en la de lluvias. La estructura ecol\u00F3gica (distribuciones rango-abundancia) fue tambi\u00E9n espec\u00EDfica para gremios y temporadas. Para los frug\u00EDvoros, la diversidad promedio, equidad y dominancia fueron mayores en bosque que en purma; la dominancia promedio fue mayor en bosque que en chacra, pero la rareza local fue mayor en chacra que en bosque, y no se encontraron diferencias entre purma y chacra. Para los forrajeadores de sustrato, la diversidad promedio y la dominancia fueron mayores en bosque que en purma, pero no se detectaron diferencias entre chacra y bosque, o entre purma y chacra.

The spike protein fragments S1 (involved in receptor-binding) and S2 (involved in membrane fusion) have been found to have different mutation rates. Fragment S1 can be further divided into two regions (S1A, which comprises approximately the first 400 nucleotides, and S1B, comprising the next 280) that also show different rates of mutation. The phylogeny presented on the basis of S1B shows that SARS-CoV is closely related to MHV (murine hepatitis virus), which is known to bind the murine receptor CEACAM1.

In contrast to published reports of experimental infections using lethal strains of the virus, clinical signs of naturally acquired FIV infection can be mild or inapparent, rather than life-threatening. In this prospective, longitudinal controlled study, based in Chicago, IL (n = 17) and Memphis, TN (n = 27), we investigated two cohorts of privately owned, naturally infected cats kept under different housing conditions. Cats in the Chicago cohort (Group 1) were kept in households of \u22642 cats, while the Memphis cohort (Group 2) comprised part of a large multi-cat household of over 60 cats kept indoors only, with unrestricted access to one another. The majority of cats from Group 1 did not display clinical signs consistent with immunodeficiency during the 22-month observation period. In contrast, the outcome of infection in Group 2 was dramatically different; 17/27 (63%) of cats lost a median of 51.3% of their bodyweight (P \u003C 0.0005) and died during the study period, with lymphoma being the most common cause of mortality. Although the decrease in CD4\u002B T cell count between enrolment and terminal disease was significant (P = 0.0017), the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of enrolment did not reliably distinguish FIV-positive cats classified as \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018not healthy\u2019 at either cohort. FIV load at enrolment was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P \u003C 0.0001), but there were no significant differences at enrolment between healthy and not healthy cats at either group. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that management and housing conditions impact on disease progression and survival times of FIV-positive cats.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u0119czkowski, Pawe\u0142 M.; Litster, Annette; Lin, Tsang Long; Mellor, Dominic J.; Willett, Brian J.; Hosie, Margaret J.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d7f75c01044b85f877a0d1800507cad01edd76b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4332694.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595267/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.12.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["Chicago"],"keyphrases":["Group","healthy cats","FIV-positive cats","infected cats","majority of cats","FIV load","longitudinal course of FIV infection","survival times of FIV","time of enrolment","natural infection","outcome of infection","study period","Chicago cohort","Memphis cohort","CD4","different housing conditions","longitudinal controlled study","contrast","housing conditions impact","clinical signs consistent","terminal disease","disease progression","years of feline immunodeficiency virus","significant differences","month observation period","T cell count","lethal strains","management","reports of experimental infections","decrease","lymphoma","CD8 ratio","inapparent","research","large multi-cat household","results","IL","common cause of mortality","bodyweight","conclusion","TN","median","households","unrestricted access","cohorts"],"language":"en"},

In particular, livestock diseases may constitute severe threats to humans due to the particularly high physical contact and exposure and, also, be the cause of important economic losses, even in non-endemic countries, where they often arise in the form of rapid and devastating epidemics. Rapid diagnostic tests have been used for a long time in field situations, particularly during outbreaks. However, they mostly rely on serological approaches, which may confirm the exposure to a particular pathogen but may be inappropriate for point-of-decision (point-of-care) settings when emergency responses supported on early and accurate diagnosis are required. Moreover, they often exhibit modest sensitivity and hence significantly depend on later result confirmation in central or reference laboratories. The impressive advances observed in recent years in materials sciences and in nanotechnology, as well as in nucleic-acid synthesis and engineering, have led to an outburst of new in-the-bench and prototype tests for nucleic-acid testing towards point-of-care diagnosis of genetic and infectious diseases. Manufacturing, commercial, regulatory, and technical nature issues for field applicability more likely have hindered their wider entrance into veterinary medicine and practice than have fundamental science gaps. This chapter begins by outlining the current situation, requirements, difficulties, and perspectives of point-of-care tests for diagnosing diseases of veterinary interest. Nucleic-acid testing, particularly for the point of care, is addressed subsequently. A range of valuable signal transduction mechanisms commonly employed in proof-of-concept schemes and techniques born on the analytical chemistry laboratories are also described. As the essential core of this chapter, sections dedicated to the principles and applications of microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip, and nanotechnology for the development of point-of-care tests are presented. Microdevices already applied or under development for application in field diagnosis of animal diseases are reviewed.","publish_time":"2014-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teles, Fernando; Fonseca, Lu\u00EDs","journal":"Veterinary Infection Biology: Molecular Diagnostics and High-Throughput Strategies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b9bf8ae4682528475db8cca89b4287c2b58f42a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122192.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2004-4_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25399103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["point of care","care tests","development of point","perspectives of point","care diagnosis of genetic","field diagnosis of animal diseases","accurate diagnosis","nucleic-acid testing","livestock diseases","infectious diseases","prototype tests","Accurate disease diagnosis","diagnosing diseases of veterinary","nucleic-acid synthesis","Rapid diagnostic tests","field applicability","field situations","humans","nanotechnology","chapter","exposure","veterinary medicine","animal well-being","reference laboratories","particular pathogen","form of rapid","analytical chemistry laboratories","practice","technical nature issues","animals","recent years","wider entrance","emergency responses","proof","later result confirmation","techniques","sections","principles","difficulties","settings","range of valuable signal transduction mechanisms","cause of important economic losses","materials sciences","severe threats","non-endemic countries","requirements","fundamental science gaps","current situation","engineering","bench","decision","high physical contact","applications of microfluidics","concept schemes","impressive advances","zoonosis transmission","long time","devastating epidemics","essential core","chip","outburst of new","Manufacturing","outbreaks","modest sensitivity","serological approaches","Microdevices"],"language":"en"},

We aim to determine the differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices in various different cohorts and explore the pertinent factors that influenced behavior in tropical Singapore. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in the Singapore military from mid-August to early-October 2009, among 3054 personnel in four exposure groups - laboratory-confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, close contacts of cases, healthcare workers, and general personnel. RESULTS: 1063 (34.8%) participants responded. The mean age was 21.4 (SE 0.2) years old. Close contacts had the highest knowledge score (71.7%, p = 0.004) while cases had the highest practice scores (58.8%, p \u003C 0.001). There was a strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.27, p \u003C 0.01) and knowledge and attitudes scores (r = 0.21, p \u003C 0.01). The significant predictors of higher practice scores were higher knowledge scores (p \u003C 0.001), Malay ethnicity (p \u003C 0.001), exposure group (p \u003C 0.05) and lower education level (p \u003C 0.05). The significant predictors for higher attitudes scores were Malay ethnicity (p = 0.014) and higher knowledge scores (p \u003C 0.001). The significant predictor for higher knowledge score was being a contact (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Knowledge is a significant influence on attitudes and practices in a pandemic, and personal experience influences practice behaviors. Efforts should be targeted at educating the general population to improve practices in the current pandemic, as well as for future epidemics.","publish_time":"2010-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yap, Jonathan; Lee, Vernon J; Yau, Teng Yan; Ng, Tze Pin; Tor, Phern-Chern","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/743c5db7611d4af74204901e0ed3b6317a0bb3c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2916908.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["higher knowledge scores","higher attitudes scores","cross-sectional knowledge","significant predictors of higher practice scores","highest practice scores","highest knowledge score","practices survey","significant influence","close contacts of cases","current pandemic","Malay ethnicity","general personnel","personal experience influences practice behaviors","pertinent factors","Singapore military","Effective influenza pandemic management","tropical Singapore","general population","exposure groups - laboratory","H1N1","healthcare workers","various different cohorts","BACKGROUND","strong correlation","lower education level","CONCLUSION","differences","mean age","years old","behavioral changes","METHODS","future epidemics","Efforts","RESULTS","participants"],"language":"en"},

Examination of the interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkey would significantly contribute to revealing the gut microbiome composition. METHODS: Here, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail, and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome. The depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real-time PCR. We also detected changes in the gut metabolome by GC-MS and LC-MS. RESULTS: A majority of bacteria were depleted after treatment with antibiotics, and the Shannon diversity index decreased from 2.95 to 0.22. Furthermore, the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) decreased from 104.47 to 33.84, and the abundance of eukaryotic viruses also changed substantially. In the annotation, 6 families of DNA viruses and 1 bacteriophage family were present in the normal monkeys but absent after gut bacterial microbiome depletion. Intriguingly, we discovered that changes in the gut bacterial microbiome composition may promote changes in the gut virome composition, and tryptophan, arginine, and quinone may play roles in the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and virome. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the clearly altered composition of the virome was correlated with depletion in the bacterial community and that metabolites produced by bacteria possibly play important roles in the interaction.

Understanding how infections spread is pivotal to public health yet current knowledge of indoor transmission remains poor. Aim To review the roles of natural ventilation and sunlight for controlling infection within healthcare environments. Methods Comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic and library databases to retrieve English language papers combining infection; risk; pathogen; and mention of ventilation; fresh air; and sunlight. Foreign language articles with English translation were included, with no limit imposed on publication date. Findings In the past, hospitals were designed with south-facing glazing, cross-ventilation and high ceilings because fresh air and sunlight were thought to reduce infection risk. Historical and recent studies suggest that natural ventilation offers protection from transmission of airborne pathogens. Particle size, dispersal characteristics and transmission risk require more work to justify infection control practices concerning airborne pathogens. Sunlight boosts resistance to infection, with older studies suggesting potential roles for surface decontamination. Conclusions Current knowledge of indoor transmission of pathogens is inadequate, partly due to lack of agreed definitions for particle types and mechanisms of spread. There is recent evidence to support historical data on the effects of natural ventilation but virtually none for sunlight. Modern practice of designing healthcare buildings for comfort favours pathogen persistence. As the number of effective antimicrobial agents declines, further work is required to clarify absolute risks from airborne pathogens along with any potential benefits from additional fresh air and sunlight.","publish_time":"2013-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hobday, R.

These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology, and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries over the last six years that promise to propel the field forward. METHODS: We conducted a search of two electronic databases, PubMed\u00AE and EMBASE\u00AE for experimental studies involving novel HIV immunogen design between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they (1) were written in a non-English language and/or (2) were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov\u00AE, to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. FINDINGS: The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth over the last three decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several novel rationally-designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last six years including native-like Env trimers, nanoparticle and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others.

From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. Aim of the study The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. Results Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16g/kg. Conclusion The results of this study provided scientific data to support the efficient and safe use of HC to combat SARS.","publish_time":"2008-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Kit-Man; Lee, Kin-Ming; Koon, Chi-Man; Cheung, Crystal Sao-Fong; Lau, Ching-Po; Ho, Hei-Ming; Lee, Mavis Yuk-Ha; Au, Shannon Wing-Ngor; Cheng, Christopher Hon-Ki; Lau, Clara Bik-San; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing; Wan, David Chi-Cheong; Waye, Mary Miu-Yee; Wong, Kam-Bo; Wong, Chun-Kwok; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei; Leung, Ping-Chung; Fung, Kwok-Pui","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a58a24ec812fd3af55d2ecabcda9c1250c70dc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126383.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874108001529; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874108001529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18479853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","mechanisms of HC","SARS problem","HC water extract","safe use of HC","Results Results","present study","proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes","anti-viral aspects","oral acute toxicity test","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","oral administration","significant increase","secretion of IL","significant inhibitory effects","life-threatening form of pneumonia","Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines","Houttuynia cordata Thunb","laboratory animals","CLpro","scientific data","CD8","RdRp","protease","hand","proportion of CD4","Chinese scientists","T cells","dose","majority of cases","China","Conclusion","flow cytometry","people","Saururaceae"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: All positive MERS-CoV cases that diagnosed in and reported to a referral hospital in Najran, KSA from March/2014 to December/2018 were revised retrospectively. We identified patients from infection control department and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: Of the 54 positive MERS-CoV cases, 3 cases were excluded because no available data. Therefore, the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases (94.4). Most of the patients were Saudi 36 (70.6%), and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 (35.3) season. Fever 47 (92.2%), cough 44 (86.3%), and shortness of breath 37 (72.5%) were reported as most common symptoms. Most patients had DM and hypertension. Overall mortality rate was 37.3%, and interestingly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years. In logistic regression analysis, Season and Chronic Kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistically significantly associated with death. The odds of death the patients infected by MERS-CoV during Autumn and Winter season were 4.09 times higher than those patients who infected during Spring and Summer season (OR = 4.09, CI 1.18-14.15, P \u003C 0.026). Compared with MERS-CoV patients who had Non-Chronic kidney diseases, the odds of death the MERS-CoV patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18.08 times higher (OR = 18.08, CI -2.01-162.99, P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection was high.

These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are \u201Cdegenerate\u201D; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.","publish_time":"1987-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricker, Jeffry P.; Skoog, Linda A.; Hirsch, Jerry","journal":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f3be1787b33af305afd7d1b6529d49529fefd2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168159187902577; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168159187902577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287572/; https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-1591(87)90257-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of changes","phenotype changes","behavioral changes","selection pressure","effects of inbreeding","domestication process","individuals","coadapted gene complexes","developmental anomalies","developmental homeostasis","Inbreeding leads","animal populations","natural populations","ideal situations","zoological parks","evolutionary principles","ability","homozygosity","breakdown","frequencies of genes","ways","increase","Abstract Captive environments","degenerate","environmental variables","notion","empirical support","nature","research","study","fact","following"],"language":"en"},

The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Arinjay; Subudhi, Sonu; Rapin, Noreen; Lew, Jocelyne; Jain, Richa; Falzarano, Darryl; Misra, Vikram","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f024d5c09ccd278a7b29cd6c0592272b243a4712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190632.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64264-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["long-term infected bat cells","uninfected cells","study MERS-CoV","long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells","MERS coronavirus","\u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV","bat interactions","genome of MERS","infected cell culture model","virus receptor","wildtype virus","virus maintenance","virus particles","virus replication","higher basal levels of interferon","reduced levels","model of coronavirus persistence","Basal levels of type","long-term persistent infection","interferon response","protein","populations of reservoir bats","hypothesis","low levels of periodic shedding","Middle East respiratory syndrome","likely route","severe acute respiratory syndrome","viral variants","viral open reading frame","SARS","mutations","DPP4","superinfection","dipeptidyl peptidase","evidence","spillover","individuals","Coronaviruses","Mathematical models","establishment","Eptesicus fuscus","enigma","transcripts","summary","mechanisms","days"],"language":"en"},

This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind\u2019s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced \u201Cfitness\u201D but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell.

The objectives of this study were to investigate how professionals visiting animal farms in Sweden in their daily work perceive the on-farm conditions for biosecurity, the factors that influence their own biosecurity routines and what they describe as obstacles for biosecurity. Suggestions for improvements were also asked for. Questionnaires were distributed to professionals visiting farms in their daily work; veterinarians, livestock hauliers, artificial insemination technicians, animal welfare inspectors and cattle hoof trimmers. The sample was a convenience sample, based on accessibility to registers or collaboration with organisations distributing the questionnaire. Respondents were asked about the availability of certain biosecurity conditions related to farm visits, e.g. if facilities for hand washing were available, how important different factors were for their own routines and, through open ended questions, to describe obstacles and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: After data cleaning, there were responses from 368 persons. There was a difference in the proportion of visited farms reported to have certain biosecurity measures in place related to animal species present on the farm. In general, visited pig farms had a higher proportion of biosecurity measures in place, whereas the conditions were poorer on sheep and goat farms and horse farms. There were also differences between the visitor categories; the perceived conditions for biosecurity varied between the groups, e.g. livestock hauliers did not have access to hand washing facilities as often as veterinarians did. In all groups, a majority of the respondents perceived obstacles for on-farm biosecurity, among veterinarians 66% perceived that there were obstacles. Many of the reported obstacles related to the very basics of biosecurity, such as access to soap and water. Responsibility was identified to be a key issue; while some farmers expect visitors to take responsibility for keeping up biosecurity they do not provide the adequate on-farm conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the respondents reported obstacles for keeping good biosecurity related to on-farm conditions. There was a gap when it came to responsibility which needs to be clarified. Visitors need to take responsibility for avoiding spread of disease, while farmers need to assume responsibility for providing adequate conditions for on-farm biosecurity.","publish_time":"2014-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00F6remark, Maria; Sternberg-Lewerin, Susanna","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b53f3fa13a84fed43c6314ae35e98f59eb54c9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4036743.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-56-28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["farm biosecurity","farm conditions","biosecurity routines","basics of biosecurity","good biosecurity","availability of certain biosecurity conditions","certain biosecurity measures","animal farms","perceived conditions","Responsibility","higher proportion of biosecurity measures","farm visits","adequate conditions","reported obstacles","goat farms","pig farms","horse farms","professionals","veterinarians","Respondents","daily work","live animal contacts","animal welfare inspectors","place","animal species present","livestock hauliers","hand washing facilities","farmers","groups","Suggestions","visitors","important different factors","indirect contacts","disease prevention","spread of disease","convenience sample","artificial insemination technicians","sheep","cattle hoof trimmers","control","Sweden","open ended questions","accessibility","visitor categories","responses","data cleaning","collaboration","organisations","key issue","soap","majority","RESULTS","water","study","difference","Questionnaires","BACKGROUND","objectives","persons","improvements","CONCLUSIONS","gap"],"language":"en"},

These viruses cause fatal disease in a wide range of species, including humans. Both NiV and HeV have continued to re-emerge sporadically in Bangladesh and Australia, respectively. There are currently no therapeutics or vaccines available to treat Henipavirus infection and both are classified as BSL4 pathogens. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in animal and plant cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNAi by inhibiting gene expression of homologous mRNA and our preliminary studies suggest RNAi may be a useful approach to developing novel therapies for these highly lethal pathogens. Eight NiV siRNA molecules (four L and four N gene specific), two HeV N gene specific, and two non-specific control siRNA molecules were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit a henipavirus minigenome replication system (which does not require the use of live virus) in addition to live virus infections in vitro. In the minigenome assay three out of the four siRNAs that targeted the L gene of NiV effectively inhibited replication. In contrast, only NiV N gene siRNAs were effective in reducing live NiV replication, suggesting inhibition of early, abundantly expressed gene transcripts may be more effective than later, less abundant transcripts. Additionally, some of the siRNAs effective against NiV infection were only partially effective inhibitors of HeV infection. An inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of siRNA inhibition was observed. The demonstration that RNAi effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro, is a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal, zoonotic pathogens.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mungall, Bruce A.; Schopman, Nick C.T.; Lambeth, Luke S.; Doran, Tim J.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12279820750341f76871c7ae807f3c9a851a3ae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125758.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208003586; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208003586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18687361/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NiV N"],"locations":["Bangladesh","Australia"],"keyphrases":["gene of NiV","NiV N gene siRNAs","NiV infection","live NiV replication","siRNAs effective","HeV N gene specific","RNAi","gene transcripts","henipavirus replication","NiV siRNA molecules","Henipavirus infection","effective inhibitors of HeV infection","effective therapy","henipavirus minigenome replication system","live virus infections","use of live virus","Hendra virus","inhibited replication","lethal pathogens","zoonotic pathogens","gene expression of homologous mRNA","stranded RNA","RNA interference","novel approach","Abstract Nipah virus","efficacy of siRNA inhibition","BSL4 pathogens","sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA","non-specific control siRNA molecules","novel therapies","useful approach","inhibition of early","zoonotic paramyxoviruses","minigenome assay","abundant transcripts","animal","addition","number of nucleotide mismatches","wide range of species","preliminary studies","fatal disease","plant cells","vaccines available","process","contrast","Small interfering RNAs","inverse correlation","new genus","humans","therapeutics","ability","demonstration","Bangladesh","Australia"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of PDCoV in suckling piglets was the highest (36.43%, 94/258).

The complete genomes of 4 PDCoV Henan strains (CH-01, HNZK-02, HNZK-04, HNZK-06) were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome, spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences revealed that the PDCoV Henan strains were closely related to other PDCoV reference strains that located in the Chinese clade. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis showed PDCoV CH-01 strain was closely related to CHN-HB-2014 strain and HKU15-44 strain, while the other PDCoV Henan strains were more related to PDCoV CHJXNI2 and CH-SXD1-2015 strains, indicating that the ancestor of these sequenced strains may different.

Transmission may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples. Here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler\u0027s encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized.

This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25% from North America, and 11% from the European/Central Asia region.

Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked.

However, respiratory tract infections in nose, larynx and/or bronchi, either viral or bacterial or both, are by far the commonest cause of acute cough. These are especially frequent and hazardous in the elderly, and community living and institutionalisation may aggravate this problem. A variety of viruses and bacteria have been incriminated, with rhinovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Bordetella pertussis being especially important. Viral infections can readily lead to community-acquired pneumonia. Successful diagnosis should point to successful treatment, and in this respect clinical examination and patient history are paramount, supplemented by chest X-ray, viral and bacterial culture and serological testing. Depending on the results of these tests, specific antibacterial therapy may be called for, although there is dispute as to the merits of antibacterial therapy in cases of uncertain diagnosis. Prevention and prophylaxis for influenza and S. pneumoniae infections are now commendably routine in the elderly, especially those in communities. Treatment, as well as the use of antibacterials, may also be directed against the inflammatory and infective processes in the airways. Non-specific antitussive therapy is common and usually highly desirable to prevent the adverse effects of repeated coughing. There have been few advances in antitussive therapy in recent years, opioids and dextromethorphan being the most commonly used agents; they act centrally on the brainstem, but also have a large placebo effect. However they work, they are much appreciated by patients and their partners. Moreover, striking advances in our understanding of the peripheral sensory and central nervous pathways of the cough reflex in recent years should soon lead to a new and more specific choice of agents to inhibit cough.","publish_time":"2012-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widdicombe, John; Kamath, Shankar","journal":"Drugs Aging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0693ce44c8059f0c65a977fa97e2d86d581698c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elderly","Viral infections","specific antibacterial therapy","cough reflex","pneumoniae infections","merits of antibacterial therapy","Non-specific antitussive therapy","Haemophilus influenza","recent years","high prevalence of acute cough","commonest cause of acute cough","respiratory tract infections","Successful diagnosis","successful treatment","community","respiratory syncytial viruses","specific choice of agents","Streptococcus pneumoniae","bacterial culture","variety of viruses","striking advances","used agents","cases of uncertain diagnosis","central nervous pathways","sale of over-the-counter remedies","respect clinical examination","patient history","chest X-ray","Bordetella pertussis","understanding","nose","larynx","dextromethorphan","rhinovirus","opioids","epidemiological studies","frequency of physician consultations","serological testing","bronchi","tests","prophylaxis","adverse effects of repeated coughing","infective processes","airways","results","institutionalisation","large placebo effect","Prevention","use of antibacterials","patients","partners","brainstem","problem","communities"],"language":"en"},

We report the outcomes of pediatric brain tumors treated with AHSCT in a quaternary referral center in Hong Kong over 10 years (June 1996\u2013May 2006). Thirteen patients with medulloblastoma (n = 9), cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1), germ cell tumor (n = 1) and cerebellar rhabdoid (n = 1) were transplanted because of tumor residual (n = 1) or recurrence (n = 12). Uniform upfront treatment protocols were adopted according to specific tumor types. Prior to AHSCT, 8 patients (61.5%) achieved complete remission and 5 (38.5%) were in partial remission. Conditioning employed thiotepa 300 mg/m(2), etoposide 250 mg/m(2 )and carboplatin 500 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days. Toxicity included mucositis and neutropenic fever in all patients, grade 4 hepatic toxicity in 4 patients (including hepatic veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients) and grade 4 renal toxicity in 1 patient. The 5-year event-free survival was 53.9%. Five patients died of disease recurrence or progression 8\u201321 months after transplant with a median disease-free period of 8 months post-transplant. One died of transplant-related complications in the early post-transplant period. Seven survived for a median of 5.4 years (maximum follow-up of 9.8 years), with six having Lansky-Karnofsky performance score above 80. All survivors had complete remission before transplant though 2 had leptomeningeal spread. We conclude that AHSCT can achieve long-term survival in children with recurrent brain tumor. However, those with macroscopic residual tumor before transplant cannot be salvaged.","publish_time":"2007-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheuk, Daniel Ka Leung; Lee, Tsz Leung; Chiang, Alan Kwok Shing; Ha, Shau Yin; Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung","journal":"J Neurooncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2429fc3b6dbc27c88a38f4c0f9c3345ef961e5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["patients","AHSCT","tumor residual","months post-transplant","recurrent brain tumor","early post-transplant period","transplant-related complications","years","germ cell tumor","macroscopic residual tumor","specific tumor types","hepatic toxicity","complete remission","Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant","cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor","children","relapsed brain tumors","grade","renal toxicity","disease recurrence","partial remission","outcomes of pediatric brain tumors","median disease-free period","long-term survival","hepatic veno-occlusive disease","year event-free survival","quaternary referral center","Hong Kong","limited data","neutropenic fever","progression","form of salvage therapy","mucositis","maximum follow-up","Uniform upfront treatment protocols","Lansky-Karnofsky performance score","cerebellar rhabdoid","survivors","leptomeningeal spread","medulloblastoma","ependymoma","Conditioning","thiotepa","etoposide","carboplatin","days"],"language":"en"},

These factors can affect outbreak severity, its rate and extent of spread, influencing the welfare of victims, their families, and their communities. We propose an agenda for research to meet the challenges of infectious disease outbreaks. What social factors led to the outbreak? What social factors affected its severity and rate and extent of spread? How did individuals, social groups, and the state react to it?

Although current research on infectious disease outbreaks pays attention to social factors related to causation, severity, rate and extent of spread, those dealing with the \u201Csocial chaos\u201D arising from outbreaks are usually neglected. Inclusion, by combining traditional public health with sociological analysis, will enrich public health theory and understanding of infectious disease outbreaks.

They carry viruses that may evolve and become highly pathogenic for poultry or zoonotic. Understanding the ecology of LPAIVs in these natural hosts is therefore essential. We assessed the clinical response, viral shedding and antibody production of juvenile mallards after intra-esophageal inoculation of two LPAIV subtypes previously isolated from wild congeners. Six ducks, equipped with data loggers that continually monitored body temperature, heart rate and activity, were successively inoculated with an H7N7 LPAI isolate (day 0), the same H7N7 isolate again (day 21) and an H5N2 LPAI isolate (day 35). After the first H7N7 inoculation, the ducks remained alert with no modification of heart rate or activity. However, body temperature transiently increased in four individuals, suggesting that LPAIV strains may have minor clinical effects on their natural hosts. The excretion patterns observed after both re-inoculations differed strongly from those observed after the primary H7N7 inoculation, suggesting that not only homosubtypic but also heterosubtypic immunity exist. Our study suggests that LPAI infection has minor clinically measurable effects on mallards and that mallard ducks are able to mount immunological responses protective against heterologous infections. Because the transmission dynamics of LPAIVs in wild populations is greatly influenced by individual susceptibility and herd immunity, these findings are of high importance. Our study also shows the relevance of using telemetry to monitor disease in animals.","publish_time":"2010-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jourdain, Elsa; Gunnarsson, Gunnar; Wahlgren, John; Latorre-Margalef, Neus; Br\u00F6jer, Caroline; Sahlin, Sofie; Svensson, Lovisa; Waldenstr\u00F6m, Jonas; Lundkvist, \u00C5ke; Olsen, Bj\u00F6rn","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d7da6e4ad1bec227e1cea32679396b45a172d56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2812492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20126617/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008935","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LPAIV","LPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N7 LPAI isolate","day","primary H7N7 inoculation","mallard ducks","dabbling ducks","H5N2 LPAI isolate","minor clinical effects","wild populations","wild congeners","body temperature","natural hosts","Wild waterfowl","LPAI infection","ecology of LPAIVs","activity","study","intra-esophageal inoculation","modification of heart rate","transmission dynamics of LPAIVs","antibody production of juvenile mallards","LPAIV subtypes","LPAIV strains","measurable effects","clinical response","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","herd immunity","heterosubtypic immunity","viral shedding","immunological responses protective","alert","main reservoir of low","findings","individual susceptibility","heterologous infections","individuals","Anas platyrhynchos","data loggers","telemetry","disease","excretion patterns","re-inoculations","relevance","homosubtypic","high importance","animals","poultry"],"language":"en"},

Similar to antibodies, aptamers bind specifically to their targets. However, compared with antibody, aptamers are easy to synthesize and modify and can bind to a broad range of targets. Thus, aptamers are promising for detecting viruses and treating viral infections. In this review, we briefly introduce aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) and describe their applications in rapid detection of viruses and as antiviral agents in treating infections. We summarize available data about the use of aptamers to detect and inhibit viruses. Furthermore, for the first time, we list aptamers specific to different viruses that have been screened out but have not yet been used for detecting viruses or treating viral infections.

Coinfections with any of these diseases could have fatal outcomes if left undiagnosed. Understanding the prevalence and distribution of coinfections is necessary to improve diagnosis and designing therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic search of the published literature based on PRISMA guidelines to identify cases of Malaria, Dengue and Chikungunya coinfections. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify eligible studies and extracted data regarding cases of coinfection from cross sectional studies, case reports, retrospective studies, prospective observational studies and surveillance reports. RESULTS: Care full screening resulted in 104 publications that met the eligibility criteria and reported Malaria/Dengue, Dengue/Chikungunya, Malaria/Chikungunya and Malaria/Dengue/Chikungunya coinfections. These coinfections were spread over six geographical locations and 42 different countries and are reported more frequently in the last 15 years possibly due to expanding epidemiology of Dengue and Chikungunya. Few of these reports have also analysed distinguishing features of coinfections. Malaria/Dengue coinfections were the most common coinfection followed by Dengue/Chikungunya, Malaria/Chikungunya and Malaria/Dengue/Chikungunya coinfections. P. falciparum and P. vivax were the commonest species found in cases of malaria coinfections and Dengue serotype-4 commonest serotype in cases of dengue coinfections. Most studies were reported from India. Nigeria and India were the only two countries from where all possible combinations of coinfections were reported. CONCLUSION: We have comprehensively reviewed the literature associated with cases of coinfections of three important vector borne diseases to present a clear picture of their prevalence and distribution across the globe. The frequency of coinfections presented in the study suggests proper diagnosis, surveillance and management of cases of coinfection to avoid poor prognosis of the underlying etiology.

Its molecular epidemiological characterization, particularly the genotyping, was poorly addressed. Methods The full-length spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were amplified from each respiratory sample collected from 65 HCoV-OC43-positive patients between 2005 and 2012. Genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Recombination was analyzed based on full-length viral genome sequences. Clinical manifestations of each HCoV genotype infection were compared by reviewing clinical records. Results Sixty of these 65 samples belong to genotypes B, C and D. The remaining five strains had incongruent positions in the phylogenetic trees of the S, RdRp and N genes, suggesting a novel genotype emerging, designated as genotype E. Whole genome sequencing and bootscan analysis indicated that genotype E is generated by recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Temporal analysis revealed a sequential genotype replacement of C, B, D and E over the study period with genotype D being the dominant genotype since 2007. The novel genotype E was only detected in children younger than three years suffering from lower respiratory tract infections. Conclusions Our results suggest that HCoV-OC43 genotypes are evolving. Such genotype shift may be an adapting mechanism for HCoV-OC43 maintaining its epidemic.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yue; Li, Jianguo; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Ying; Chen, Lan; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/660fb7e04a6ed556c01c0e4aecdbf5321ac154b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112537.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2014.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25530469/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445314003764; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445314003764","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombination"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genotype D","HCoV genotype infection","dominant genotype","genotype shift","novel genotype E","HCoV-OC43 genotypes","sequential genotype replacement of C","prevalent HCoV","genotypes B","phylogenetic analysis","RdRp","Temporal analysis","bootscan analysis","N genes","lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory sample","Recombination","Results","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","phylogenetic trees","full-length spike","genome sequencing","full-length viral genome sequences","Clinical manifestations","clinical records","years","study period","incongruent positions","strains","adapting mechanism","Summary Background Human coronavirus","children younger","nucleocapsid","samples","molecular epidemiological characterization","genotyping","Methods","positive patients","Conclusions","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination is the principal means to combat the impact of influenza. During an influenza pandemic the immune status of the population would differ from that which exists during interpandemic periods. An emerging pandemic virus will create a surge in worldwide vaccine demand and new approaches in immunisation strategies may be needed to ensure optimum protection of unprimed individuals when vaccine antigen may be limited. The manufacture of vaccines from pathogenic avian influenza viruses by traditional methods is not feasible for safety reasons as well as technical issues. Strategies adopted to overcome these issues include the use of reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains, the use of baculovirusexpressed haemagglutinin or related non-pathogenic avian influenza strains, and the use of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. In clinical trials, conventional surfaceantigen influenza virus vaccines produced from avian viruses have proved poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive populations.

About 10% of them will be hospitalized, with significant physical and economic burdens. Objectives To compare two cohorts of infants with AVB, from same region, in a ten-year interval, regarding epidemiologic factors and viral etiology. Study design Cohorts: 142 (2004) and 172 (2014) infants at ages zero to 12 months; clinical diagnosis of AVB; medical care in hospital and genetic screening of nasopharyngeal secretion for respiratory viruses. Results The comparative analysis showed a difference in the percentage of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive patients [2004 (33.1%); 2014 (70.3%)] (p\u003C0.01). No differences were noted regarding gender, breastfeeding, tobacco exposure, crowding and maternal education. There was a difference as to the month of incidence (seasonality) of AVB (higher in April 2014). There was a higher age at attendance in the first cohort, and lower birth weight and gestational age ratios in the second cohort (p\u003C0.05). There were no differences in hospitalization time, need of mechanical ventilation and number of deaths, however a difference regarding co-morbidities was noted (higher in 2004) (p\u003C0.001). Conclusion None of the analyzed variables had an impact on severity features. Virology and immunology must be considered in this kind of situation, by studying genetic variants and the maturation of the immune system in AVB by RSV or other viruses.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wollmeister, Elinara; Alvarez, Alfonso Eduardo; Bastos, Juliana Cristina Santiago; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima; Ribeiro, Jos\u00E9 Dirceu; Baracat, Em\u00EDlio Carlos Elias; Arns, Clarice Weis; Riccetto, Adriana Gut Lopes","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be83cbc46b78b4b3a81c6db1a7dc6004e7ad5f38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29227860/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321730330X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321730330X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher age","clinical diagnosis of AVB","RSV","respiratory viruses","cohorts of infants","differences","genetic variants","viral etiology","year of life","gestational age ratios","Study design Cohorts","genetic screening of nasopharyngeal secretion","percentage of respiratory syncytial virus","episode of acute viral bronchiolitis","medical care","lower birth weight","tobacco exposure","mechanical ventilation","epidemiologic factors","months","maturation","analyzed variables","ten-year interval","number of deaths","positive patients","immune system","impact","gender","breastfeeding","hospitalization time","region","seasonality","severity features","month of incidence","co-morbidities","economic burdens","maternal education","Abstract Background","kind of situation","children","ages","attendance","comparative analysis","immunology","Conclusion","Objectives","Virology"],"language":"en"},

No study to date has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in a large, urban emergency medical services (EMS) system. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing\u0027s EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007. Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. \u03C7(2) tests were performed to compare the difference. RESULTS: Seven thousand thirty-two cases of ACS were identified by the EMS system physicians during the 2-year study period, including 536 cases of acute myocardial infarction. A significant variation of circadian distribution of ACS was observed in both 24-hour (P \u003C .001) and 2-hour (P \u003C .001) interval time course. Two peaks were observed in the morning from 0800 to 1000 and approaching midnight from 2200 to 2400. Increases of 50% and 60.8% in the morning and evening peaks were found, respectively, when compared with the early morning baseline (nadir). No significant difference was found among the accumulated cases in 2 years on each day in a week (P = .203). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, in the Beijing metropolitan area, the presentation of ACS has significant circadian rhythm characterized by 2 peaks within 24 hours, the morning peak is 0800 to 1000, and the late evening peak is 2200 to 2400. No significant weekly rhythm was observed in the present study.","publish_time":"2010-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yi; Du, Tiekuan; Lewin, Matthew R.; Wang, Houli; Ji, Xu; Zhang, Yanping; Xu, Tengda; Xu, Lingjie","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30266f3a22777ff4d5210e49a7094e1cfe4bef62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20637380/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2009.02.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675709001016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675709001016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","EMS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["cases of ACS","day","presentation of ACS","significant difference","significant circadian rhythms","significant variation of circadian distribution of ACS","morning peak","significant weekly rhythm","present study","evening peaks","Beijing\u0027s EMS system","EMS system physicians","accumulated cases","year study period","early morning baseline","cases of acute myocardial infarction","late evening peak","electronic prehospital medical records","prehospital setting","urban emergency medical services","incidence of acute coronary syndromes","hospital studies","age patterns of occurrence","ACSs","Beijing metropolitan area","years","interval time course","BACKGROUND","nadir","hours","date","tests","goal","METHODS","Data","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","midnight"],"language":"en"},

This device consists of three separate modules: viewer, console and visual tube. The 4-inch LCD viewer panel displays the real-time video image with optimal view angle. The console is designed with respect to ergonomics allowing comfortable manipulation and internally accommodating the power supply, image processing components and connector platform for both viewer and probe. The distal end of the detachable probe is packaged with a high resolution lens, CMOS sensor, and four LEDs. The proximal end is a 6-pin connector which can be readily removed and attached on demand. The probe is detachable and disposable with length and diameter adaptable to the size of the endotracheal tube. In our preliminary test, the video-guided apparatus helped inexperienced performers to identify the vocal cords correctly and improve the success rate of intubation on the simulation model. With further improvements on the miniature design, all captured images could be transmitted to remote devices through standard wireless transmission and could thus be stored in a specific database station. The wireless technique enables image sharing on multiple devices while a powerful database can provide valuable resources for training, data mining and serial case studies. We demonstrate that the CMOS image sensor combined with advanced reduced instruction set computer machine can serve as a visual aid for tracheal intubation. The disposable station will become a revolutionary technology both in clinical practice and medical education.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeh, Jia-Rong; Shieh, Jiann-Shing; Lin, Chih-Peng; Sun, Wei-Zen","journal":"Acta Anaesthesiologica Taiwanica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fefce09c13ca598e5fb20e02c9f19d840bd2a7a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875459708600296; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1875-4597(08)60029-6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875459708600296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMOS image sensor","real-time video image","image sharing","semiconductor image sensor","CMOS sensor","detachable probe","image processing components","video-guided apparatus","compact video-guided intubation system","tracheal intubation","console","visual tube","disposable station","success rate of intubation","specific database station","multiple devices","remote devices","inch LCD viewer panel","connector platform","powerful database","wireless technique","visual aid","pin connector","novel apparatus","distal end","proximal end","endotracheal tube","standard wireless transmission","data mining","training","advanced reduced instruction","valuable resources","power supply","length","inexperienced performers","computer machine","revolutionary technology","clinical practice","size","diameter adaptable","optimal view angle","high resolution lens","serial case studies","comfortable manipulation","vocal cords","captured images","separate modules","miniature design","respect","ergonomics","Sunscope","medical education","simulation model","preliminary test","improvements","LEDs"],"language":"en"},

These patients may acquire viral infections through exogenous routes including community exposure, donor organs, and blood products or by endogenous reactivation of latent viruses. Beside major opportunistic infections due to CMV and EBV and viral hepatitis B and C, several viral diseases have recently emerged in KTRs. New medical practices or technologies, implementation of new diagnostic tools, and improved medical information have contributed to the emergence of these viral diseases in this special population. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on emerging viral diseases and newly discovered viruses in KTRs over the last two decades. We identified viruses in the field of KT that had shown the greatest increase in numbers of citations in the NCBI PubMed database. BKV was the most cited in the literature and linked to an emerging disease that represents a great clinical concern in KTRs. HHV\u20108, PVB19, WNV, JCV, H1N1 influenza virus A, HEV, and GB virus were the main other emerging viruses. Excluding HHV8, newly discovered viruses have been infrequently linked to clinical diseases in KTRs. Nonetheless, pathogenicity can emerge long after the discovery of the causative agent, as has been the case for BKV. Overall, antiviral treatments are very limited, and reducing immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of management.

Emerging evidence further suggests that the interaction between recipient genetics, immunosuppression therapies, and allograft environmental exposures, including pulmonary infection, contributes to high rejection rates after lung transplantation.

Furthermore, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles: as all other cellular endomembranes, they are continuously moving along cytoskeleton, and, most importantly, they constantly interact one with each other by membrane tethering, fusion and fission. This review aims to highlight the tight correlation between the morphodynamics of mitochondria and their biological function(s), in physiological as well as stress conditions, in particular nutrient deprivation, pathogen attack and some human diseases.

As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.","publish_time":"2009-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfefferle, Susanne; Kr\u00E4hling, Verena; Ditt, Vanessa; Grywna, Klaus; M\u00FChlberger, Elke; Drosten, Christian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/963285bb042097a1c7b9053b74db098d24818b25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2739521.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19698190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ORF","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deleted virus","parental virus","prototype virus","original virus","fold increase of virus RNA","b deletion","b protein","context of virus replication","delayed accumulation of virus","mean titers of infectious virus","strain Frankfurt","Vero cells","SARS-Coronavirus strains","SARS-Coronavirus genome","SARS-CoV","presumed Frankfurt","HUH7 cells","pretreatment of cells","SARS epidemic","outbreak of SARS","SARS-Coronavirus reference strains","intact ORF","role of ORF","interferon beta induction","viral RNA","genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt","variant","earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt","Transfection of capped RNA","nucleotide deletion","full-length protein","parental strain","CaCo","T7 RNA polymerase promoter","altered induction of apoptosis","higher titers","Syrian Golden Hamsters","attenuating factor","10e4 plaque","transmembrane domain","replicative advantage","units","construct","ancestor","bacterial artificial chromosome","cleavage of procaspase","cell culture","secretion of type","HEK","lungs","Germany","supernatant","difference","early phase of infection","changes","patients","attenuation","spread","effect"],"language":"en"},

The viral spike protein plays pivotal roles in mediating receptor-recognition and membrane-fusion, and is therefore a key factor involved in viral pathogenesis and inter-species transmission. Here we reported the structural and functional characterization of the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) from DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (HKU23-NTD). Via mucin-binding assays, we showed that HKU23-NTD is able to bind sugars. We further solved the structure of HKU23-NTD, performed structure-guided mutagenesis and successfully located the potential sugar-binding pockets in the structure. Furthermore, via comparison of available betaCoV NTD structures, we demonstrated that betaCoV NTDs contain a conserved \u03B2-sandwich core, but exhibit variant folds in the peripheral elements located in the top-ceiling region and on the lateral side. While showing different compositions and structures, these peripheral elements are topologically equivalent \u03B2-sandwich-core insertions, highlighting a divergent evolution process for betaCoVs to form different lineages.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yanwei; He, Bin; Yang, Jing; Ye, Fei; Lin, Sheng; Yang, Fanli; Chen, Zimin; Chen, Zhujun; Cao, Yu; Lu, Guangwen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b57ef8d50a9444100bc2f6f27ea8e6b35875247.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279241/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219301631; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219301631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HKU23-NTD","structure of HKU23","DcCoV UAE-HKU23 coronavirus","comparison of available betaCoV NTD structures","peripheral elements","betaCoV NTDs","conserved \u03B2-sandwich core","viral spike protein","equivalent \u03B2-sandwich","structure-guided mutagenesis","core insertions","viral pathogenesis","different compositions","different lineages","mucin-binding assays","spike N-terminal domain","potential sugar-binding pockets","pivotal roles","mediating receptor-recognition","divergent evolution process","betaCoVs","variant folds","functional characterization","inter-species transmission","membrane-fusion","key factor","ceiling region","human cells","betacoronavirus","sugars"],"language":"en"},

Translation of the pol gene is dependent upon readthrough of the gag UAG stop codon; whereas the env gene is translated from spliced mRNA transcripts. Here, we report the first high resolution analysis of retrovirus gene expression through tandem ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of MuLV-infected cells. RESULTS: Ribosome profiling of MuLV-infected cells was performed, using the translational inhibitors harringtonine and cycloheximide to distinguish initiating and elongating ribosomes, respectively. Meta-analyses of host cell gene expression demonstrated that the RiboSeq datasets specifically captured the footprints of translating ribosomes at high resolution. Direct measurement of ribosomal occupancy of the MuLV genomic RNA indicated that ~ 7% of ribosomes undergo gag stop codon readthrough to access the pol gene. Initiation of translation was found to occur at several additional sites within the 5\u2032 leaders of the gag and env transcripts, upstream of their respective annotated start codons. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments reveal the existence of a number of previously uncharacterised, ribosomally occupied open reading frames within the MuLV genome, with possible regulatory consequences. In addition, we provide the first direct measurements of stop codon readthrough efficiency during cellular infection.

For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.","publish_time":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazeaud, Cl\u00E9ment; Freppel, Wesley; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent","journal":"Front Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12a4354b2c97189beca7e04d721508f420928396.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6288177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564270/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00595","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["vRNA secondary","vRNA translation","fates of flavivirus vRNA","genomic viral RNA","RNA modifications","RNA synthesis","viral polyprotein","optimal viral replication","single RNA species","antiviral processes","specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA","optimal replication","mature viral proteins","assembled viral particles","production of antiviral factors","study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism","activation antiviral","Flavivirus genus","flaviviruses","addition","dynamic processes","yellow fever viruses","single open reading frame","nuclear step","Zika","West Nile","interferons","cytoplasmic fate","flaviviral life cycle","tertiary structures","genetic information necessary","dengue","cytosolic sensors","sfRNA","pathways","unmet medical need","important public health concerns","current understanding","time","excellent model","infection","fine-tuned equilibrium","encapsidation","mechanisms","interferon-stimulated genes","DNA intermediate","foreign molecule","antivirals","vaccines","space","environment favorable","molecular level","infected cells","coding","template","pathogens","review"],"language":"en"},

The digestive system is composed of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or the alimentary canal, salivary glands, the liver, and the exocrine pancreas. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are to digest and absorb ingested nutrients, and to excrete waste products of digestion. Most nutrients are ingested in a form that is either too complex for absorption or insoluble, and therefore, indigestible or incapable of being digested. Within the GI tract, much of these substances are solubilized and further degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size, and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. This chapter explains in detail the mechanisms of salivary secretions, compositions of saliva, and the functions of saliva. The chapter also elaborates properties of bile as well as the synthesis of bile acids. The chapter explores the pathogenesis of the important gastrointestinal diseases of domestic animals, and the biochemical basis for their diagnosis and treatment. The chapter concludes with a discussion on disturbances of gastrointestinal function such as vomition, acute diarrheas, malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, and ulcerative colitis.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hornbuckle, William E.; Simpson, Kenneth W.; Tennant, Bud C.","journal":"Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7d9c2dc79e8312ce7c6f5391f718d94e08ed214.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173558.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704917000143; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704917000143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","gastrointestinal tract","GI tract","disturbances of gastrointestinal function","functions of saliva","form","ingested nutrients","important gastrointestinal diseases of domestic animals","biochemical basis","salivary glands","compositions of saliva","principal functions","properties of bile","mechanisms of salivary secretions","waste products of digestion","synthesis of bile acids","normal biochemical processes of intestinal secretion","acute diarrheas","bacterial overgrowth","malabsorption","vomition","liver","alimentary canal","size","pathogenesis","discussion","ulcerative colitis","Publisher Summary","simple molecules","diagnosis","treatment","mucosal epithelium","exocrine pancreas","digestive system","substances"],"language":"en"},

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting changes in society due to social distancing measures, has showcased inequities in access to decent work and experiences of discrimination resulting in many of the vulnerable populations in the United States experiencing a much harsher impact on economic and work-related factors. The purpose of this essay is to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic may differentially affect workers of color, individuals from low-income backgrounds, and women in complex ways. First, this essay will discuss disproportionate representation of workers from low-income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in sectors most affected by COVID-19. Second, it will discuss the lack of decent work for low-income workers who perform \u201Cessential\u201D tasks. Third, this essay will highlight economic and work-related implications of increased discrimination Asian Americans are experiencing in society. Finally, role conflict and stress for women who are managing additional unpaid work, including caretaking responsibilities, while needing to continue to engage in paid work will be examined. A research agenda will be set forth throughout the essay, calling for vocational psychologists to engage in research that fully examines how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting vulnerable communities.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kantamneni, Neeta","journal":"J Vocat Behav","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/913701484ca650709ed6a98932c712435fc41773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205696.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001879120300646; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390658/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879120300646?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["essay","COVID","low-income workers","low-income backgrounds","pandemic","lack of decent work","women","workers of color","individuals","additional unpaid work","marginalized backgrounds","society","ethnic minority backgrounds","disproportionate representation of workers","work-related factors","experiences of discrimination","vulnerable populations","resulting changes","vulnerable communities","research agenda","work-related implications of increased discrimination Asian Americans","harsher impact","inequities","social distancing measures","inequalities","United States","access","sectors","national crises","labor market","stress","caretaking responsibilities","complex ways","role conflict","vocational psychologists","tasks","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched in MEDLINE and Embase, as well as grey literature up to April 17, 2020, on the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage. This resulted in 390 unique records, of which fourteen were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients. Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation. We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in two COVID-19 patients out of a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine. A limitation of these results is unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia. Daily ECG monitoring and other risk mitigation strategies should be considered in order to prevent possible harms from what is currently an unproven therapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jankelson, Lior; Karam, Giorgio; Becker, Matthijs L.; Chinitz, Larry A.; Tsai, Meng-Chiao","journal":"Heart Rhythm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8378ec07443ac458dd0aa00afbdb43b9ad3d923.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211688.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527120304318; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527120304318?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","COVID","risk of QT prolongation","risk of arrhythmia","short-term chloroquine","significant QT interval prolongation","hydroxychloroquine usage","increased risk of torsades","evidence of ventricular arrhythmia","high-dose chloroquine","sudden death","risk mitigation strategies","arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine","possible publication","compelling evidence","possible harms","Daily ECG monitoring","unclear follow-up","reporting bias","recommendations","results","pointes","fourteen","order","data","systematic review","Published guidance documents","potential adverse effects","Embase","qualitative synthesis","limitation","drugs","grey literature","unique records","group","medications","unproven therapy","MEDLINE","treatments"],"language":"en"},

In this report, a bacterial expression system was developed for the expression and purification of the full-length PCV 2 capsid (Cap) protein from a codon-optimized cap gene. Replacement of rare arginine codons located at the 5\u2032 end of the cap reading frame with codons optimal for E. coli was found to overcome the poor expression of the viral protein in the prokaryotic system. The Cap protein was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by using a single cation-exchange chromatography at a yield of 10 mg per litre of bacterial culture. Despite the failure of the E. coli-expressed Cap protein to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), the immunization of mice with recombinant Cap yielded antibodies with the same specificity as those raised against native PCV 2 virions. In addition, the antigenic properties of the purified Cap protein were employed in a subunit-based indirect ELISA to monitor the levels of PCV 2 specific antibodies in piglets originating from a herd which was experiencing PCV 2 infection. These results pave the way for a straightforward large-scale production of the recombinant PCV 2 capsid protein and its use as a diagnostic antigen or a PCV 2 subunit vaccine.","publish_time":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcekova, Zuzana; Psikal, Ivan; Kosinova, Eva; Benada, Oldrich; Sebo, Peter; Bumba, Ladislav","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b662007562000abffc1438cced3ecfac780de171.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119500.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664658/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.07.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["PCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified Cap protein","recombinant PCV","levels of PCV","detection of PCV","full-length PCV","native PCV","recombinant Cap","viral protein","capsid protein of porcine circovirus","codon-optimized cap gene","bacterial expression system","diagnostic antigen","coli","poor expression","specific antibodies","codons optimal","subunit vaccine","prokaryotic system","litre of bacterial culture","Replacement of rare arginine codons","straightforward large-scale production","postweaning multisystemic","associated disease","immunization of mice","frame","antigenic properties","use","single cation-exchange chromatography","yield","way","VLPs","particles","herd","piglets","purification","specificity","indirect ELISA","syndrome","PMWS","homogeneity","end","report","results","addition","virions","infection","failure"],"language":"en"},

Anthrax is a dimorphic bacterium that normally exists as spores. The clinical presentation can be as cutaneous, inhalational or gastrointestinal forms that are fortuitously not transmissible from person to person. The insidious nature of anthrax has both vegetative and spore morphology. The vegetative state, being the growth phase, is typically responsive to most classes of antibiotics, while the spore phase is not. Plague is caused by a bacterium carried by a rodent flea. While current antibiotics are effective against plague, the worry is the possibility of a bioengineered chimeric construct that would be resistant to all classes of antibiotics. Tularemia is a zoonosis that occurs naturally in the United States, with animal transmission to man. Sometimes an insect vector may also be the primary route of infection. It is highly pathogenic and the inhalation of 10 organisms would be adequate for infection. Smallpox is the most feared of all biowarfare pathogens, primarily due to its high transmissibility versus other pathogens whose etiologic affects are episodic.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ving J.","journal":"Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecdf19a7364ff411ad84c24916103819f21b2f03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127116.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774304390172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287465/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-7743(04)39017-2; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774304390172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["plague","classes of antibiotics","smallpox","current antibiotics","spore phase","person","tularemia","insidious nature of anthrax","vegetative state","biowarfare pathogens","growth phase","dimorphic bacterium","spore morphology","primary route of infection","chemical warfare agents","bacillus anthracis","yersinia pestis","chapter","possibility","variola major","etiologic affects","bioengineered chimeric construct","United States","animal transmission","gastrointestinal forms","organisms","high transmissibility","worry","Publisher Summary","francesella tularensis","inhalation","man","insect vector","clinical presentation","zoonosis","rodent flea","spores"],"language":"en"},

Despite research attempts over many years, our understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ACE is still far from complete. Here, we present results of all atom molecular dynamics simulations of ACE with and without ligands. Two types of inhibitors, competitive and mixed non-competitive, were used to model the ligand bound forms. In the absence of a ligand the simulation showed spontaneous large hinge-bending motions of multiple conversions between the closed and open states of ACE, while the ligand bound forms were stable in the closed state. Our simulation results imply that the equilibrium between pre-existing backbone conformations shifts in the presence of a ligand. The hinge-bending motion of ACE is considered as an essential to the enzyme function.

METHODS: We utilized Medicaid Extract files from 27 states from 1999 to 2006 linked to the National Cystic Fibrosis Registry to establish a cohort of children 0\u20132 years with CF diagnosis. Eligible children entered the cohort after CF diagnosis and after RSV season onset, and were followed until season end, second birthday, death, or hospitalizations for reasons other then the study outcome. Two outcomes were examined: hospitalization for RSV infections (RSV\u2010ha), or hospitalization for acute respiratory infections (ARI\u2010ha). Palivizumab exposure was defined based on pharmacy or procedure claims as current (claim date plus 30 days), former (day 31\u201360 after a claim), and no exposure (days before the first or \u003E60 days after any claim). Both outcomes were examined in a Cox regression model, adjusting for RSV risk factors and CF severity via exposure propensity score. RESULTS: The matched cohort included 1,974 infants (2,875 infant seasons), who experienced 32 RSV\u2010ha and 212 ARI\u2010ha (3.9 and 26.2/1,000 season months, respectively). Compared to periods of no use, the adjusted hazard ratio for current use was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20\u20131.60) for RSV\u2010related hospitalization and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59\u20131.21) for ARI\u2010related hospitalization. Each month of increasing age reduced the ARI\u2010ha by 5.8%. CONCLUSION: RSV hospitalization incidence was low suggesting either little contribution of the virus to respiratory infections in patients with CF or lack of RSV testing. Unadjusted and adjusted RSV\u2010hospitalization incidence rates suggested potentially positive effects of palivizumab, but results were inconclusive due to small event rates. Hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness with possible RSV contribution showed no association with palivizumab use, suggesting limited overall effect of palivizumab. Younger age greatly increased infection risk.

Stress also often leads to reorganization of nuclear architecture, reflecting the simultaneous inhibition of major nuclear pathways (e.g., replication and transcription) and activation of specific stress responses (e.g., DNA repair). In this review, we focus on how two nuclear organelles, the nucleolus and the Cajal body, respond to stress. The nucleolus senses stress and is a central hub for coordinating the stress response. We review nucleolar function in the stress-induced regulation of p53 and the specific changes in nucleolar morphology and composition that occur upon stress.

However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood. The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection. We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. With the progression of the enteric infection, inflammation, virus-positive cells, and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jie; Li, Cun; Zhao, Guangyu; Chu, Hin; Wang, Dong; Yan, Helen Hoi-Ning; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Wen, Lei; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Chiu, Man Chun; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Au-Yeung, Rex K.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose. Methods Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent\u2014artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. Results Significant reductions (\u22653 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. Conclusions These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mills, Devin; Harnish, Delbert A.; Lawrence, Caryn; Sandoval-Powers, Megan; Heimbuch, Brian K.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d210908474a8807832aa60bdf4cbaf57c580c9b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678452/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318301408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.02.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318301408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFR","UVGI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FFR decontamination","decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs","UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza","influenza pandemic","N95 FFR models","H1N1 influenza","influenza viability","FFR holdings","UVGI method","Viable influenza","cm2 UVGI","contaminated surfaces","effective decontamination","optimized UVGI dose","soiling conditions","careful consideration of FFR model","presence of soiling agents","reuse of N95 filtering facepiece respirators","artificial saliva","potential shortage","pandemic events","artificial skin oil","median tissue culture infectious dose assay","material type","past research","log","Background Safe","samples","data","facepieces","minute","straps","design","Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation","Conclusions","Significant reductions","study","Methods","virus","Implementation"],"language":"en"},

The active surveillance for HAdV infections was sparse in China, and current knowledge on the HAdV-type distributions and its molecular evolution is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To acquire better understanding on the prevalence and molecular evolution of HAdV-55 strains in China, for an informed strategy for disease control and prevention. POPULATION/METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with ARTI in Chongqing during 2009\u20132012. The genotype of HAdV isolates were determined by sequencing the partial hexon and fiber genes. Whole genome sequences of HAdV-55 were obtained for molecular evolution analysis. RESULTS: About 191 (8\u00B755%) HAdV were detected in 2234 children, including 92 (48\u00B72%) with HAdV-7, 72 (37\u00B77%) with HAdV-3, 6 (3\u00B71%) with HAdV-55, 5 (2\u00B76%) with HAdV-5, 4 (2\u00B71%) with HAdV-1, 1 (0\u00B75%) with HAdV-2, and 11(5\u00B78%) with untyped HAdV. Four of these children developed pneumonia, two of whom were diagnosed with severe pneumonia and/or encephalopathy. HAdV-55 isolates clustered with HAdV-11 sequences based on the hexon gene and clustered with HAdV-14 sequences based on the fiber gene and the whole genome. The overall evolutionary rates of hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome of HAdV-55 were estimated at 6\u00B72 \u00D7 10(\u22125) s/s/y, 8\u00B70 \u00D7 10(\u22125) s/s/y, and 1\u00B77 \u00D7 10(\u22125) s/s/y, respectively.

As such, wildlife managers are often tasked with mitigating the negative effects of disease. Yet, parasites form a major component of biodiversity that often persist. This is due to logistical challenges of implementing management strategies and to insufficient understanding of host\u2013parasite dynamics. We advocate for an inclusive understanding of molecular diversity in driving parasite infection and variable host disease states in wildlife systems. More specifically, we examine the roles of genetic, epigenetic, and commensal microbial variation in disease pathogenesis. These include mechanisms underlying parasite virulence and host resistance and tolerance, and the development, regulation, and parasite subversion of immune pathways, among other processes. Case studies of devil facial tumor disease in Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and chytridiomycosis in globally distributed amphibians exemplify the broad range of questions that can be addressed by examining different facets of molecular diversity. For particularly complex systems, integrative molecular analyses present a promising frontier that can provide critical insights necessary to elucidate disease dynamics operating across scales. These insights enable more accurate risk assessment, reconstruction of transmission pathways, discernment of optimal intervention strategies, and development of more effective and ecologically sound treatments that minimize damage to the host population and environment. Such measures are crucial when mitigating threats posed by wildlife disease to humans, domestic animals, and species of conservation concern.","publish_time":"2018-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeCandia, Alexandra L.; Dobson, Andrew P.; vonHoldt, Bridgett M.","journal":"Conserv Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01f6395be4e9fb9a2f6214070890854d57ee9637.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162296.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wildlife disease","disease dynamics","disease pathogenesis","variable host disease states","parasite dynamics","negative effects of disease","host resistance","parasite virulence","host population","wildlife systems","insufficient understanding of host","driving parasite infection","parasite subversion of immune pathways","development","inclusive understanding of molecular diversity","biodiversity conservation","wildlife managers","Case studies of devil facial tumor disease","different facets of molecular diversity","integrative molecular analyses","domestic animals","domestic livestock","management strategies","serious threats","complex systems","reconstruction of transmission pathways","critical insights necessary","species of conservation concern","major component of biodiversity","discernment of optimal intervention strategies","Tasmanian devils","human health","promising frontier","agricultural investment","Sarcophilus harrisii","tolerance","humans","accurate risk assessment","commensal microbial variation","emergence of zoonoses","distributed amphibians","chytridiomycosis","spillover","damage","regulation","Pathogens","sound treatments","mechanisms","broad range of questions","epizootic outbreaks","roles of genetic","parasites","logistical challenges","environment","measures"],"language":"en"},

Our previous study has shown that subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG (RBD-Fc) induced strong systemic neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Here, we compared local and systemic immune responses induced by RBD-Fc via intranasal (i.n.) and s.c. immunization pathways. We found that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induced systemic humoral immune responses comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs.

While there is a substantial body of literature on burnout in healthcare providers, burnout in pediatric nurses has received less attention. This subpopulation may be unique from adult care nurses because of the specialized nature of providing care to children who are typically seen as a vulnerable population, the high potential for empathetic engagement, and the inherent complexities in the relationships with families. Thus, the aim of this scoping review was to investigate, among pediatric nurses, (i) the prevalence and/or degree of burnout, (ii) the factors related to burnout, (iii) the outcomes of burnout, and (iv) the interventions that have been applied to prevent and/or mitigate burnout. This scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA Guidelines Scoping Review Extension. CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, and The Cochrane Library were searched on 3 November 2018 to identify relevant quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies on pediatric nurse burnout. Our search identified 78 studies for inclusion in the analysis. Across the included studies, burnout was prevalent in pediatric nurses. A number of factors were identified as impacting burnout including nurse demographics, work environment, and work attitudes. Similarly, a number of outcomes of burnout were identified including nurse retention, nurse well-being, patient safety, and patient-family satisfaction. Unfortunately, there was little evidence of effective interventions to address pediatric nurse burnout. Given the prevalence and impact of burnout on a variety of important outcomes, it is imperative that nursing schools, nursing management, healthcare organizations, and nursing professional associations work to develop and test the interventions to address key attitudinal and environmental factors that are most relevant to pediatric nurses.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buckley, Laura; Berta, Whitney; Cleverley, Kristin; Medeiros, Christina; Widger, Kimberley","journal":"Hum Resour Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/116ef3f25148786d59aa6239503fdc55b9021a8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7014723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046721/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-0451-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA Guidelines Scoping Review Extension"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric nurse burnout","outcomes of burnout","impacting burnout","impact of burnout","degree of burnout","pediatric nurses","nurse well-being","nurse demographics","nurse retention","scoping review","adult care nurses","healthcare providers","number of factors","number of outcomes","healthcare organizations","nursing management","patient safety","nursing schools","work environment","included studies","environmental factors","work attitudes","Review Extension","prevalence","mixed-method studies","nursing professional associations","patient-family satisfaction","variety of important outcomes","little evidence of effective interventions","specialized nature","level","empathetic engagement","ASSIA","PsycINFO","inherent complexities","high potential","impacts","individual provider","EMBASE","MEDLINE","substantial body of literature","vulnerable population","PRISMA Guidelines","CINAHL","relationships","families","subpopulation","children","inclusion","Cochrane Library","search","analysis","aim","attention"],"language":"en"},

Epigenetics, an essential mechanism for gene regulation based on chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins, is also involved in congenital ASDs. It was recently demonstrated that environmental factors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and mental stress in early life, can change epigenetic status and gene expression, and can cause ASDs. Moreover, environmentally induced epigenetic changes are not erased during gametogenesis and are transmitted to subsequent generations, leading to changes in behavior phenotypes. However, epigenetics has a reversible nature since it is based on the addition or removal of chemical residues, and thus the original epigenetic status may be restored. Indeed, several antidepressants and anticonvulsants used for mental disorders including ASDs restore the epigenetic state and gene expression. Therefore, further epigenetic understanding of ASDs is important for the development of new drugs that take advantages of epigenetic reversibility.","publish_time":"2016-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubota, Takeo; Mochizuki, Kazuki","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46db8b3db38acf771fe27031fee9445b99146308.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4881129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27187441/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph13050504","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epigenetic understanding of ASDs","epigenetic state","original epigenetic status","induced epigenetic changes","congenital ASDs","advantages of epigenetic reversibility","gene expression","environmental factors","mental disorders","gene regulation","genetic factors","Epigenetics","mental stress","chemical modifications of DNA","removal of chemical residues","pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders","endocrine disrupting chemicals","early life","development of new drugs","histone proteins","essential mechanism","gametogenesis","anticonvulsants","subsequent generations","addition","antidepressants","behavior phenotypes","reversible nature"],"language":"en"},

The proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers: real time patient monitoring, real time decision and data storage, patient classification and disease diagnosis, and data retrieval and visualization. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we implemented our platform based on the Hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data.

Objective We described the clinical practice of diagnostic testing for respiratory virus infections in patients presenting to ICU with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Study design Prospective observational study in consecutive CAP and HAP patients with an ICU stay of more than 24h in two tertiary care hospitals in The Netherlands, from 2011 to December 2013. The proportion of patients receiving diagnostic testing with PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses in respiratory tract specimens was determined. Results In total, 1452 patients were included, of which 712 patients presented with CAP and 740 with HAP. In CAP, 282 of 712 (40%) were tested for respiratory viruses (190 of 417 (46%) during the influenza season). In HAP, 95 of 740 (13%) were tested (50 of 372 (13%) during the influenza season). Regardless of the season, virus diagnostic tests were ordered significantly more often in patients with comorbidities, and in those presenting with elevated CRP and leucopenia. In patients who were tested during the influenza season, the prevalence of influenza was 14% in patients with CAP and 10% in those with HAP. Influenza was absent during the summer in both groups. Conclusions Less than half of patients admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumonia were tested for the presence of viral pathogens, either in or outside the influenza season.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Someren Gr\u00E9ve, Frank; Ong, David S.Y.; Cremer, Olaf L.; Bonten, Marc J.M.; Bos, Lieuwe D.J.; de Jong, Menno D.; Schultz, Marcus J.; Juffermans, Nicole P.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c3439a3b5ddcf405fe53dfd61f57bf4874fac3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106504.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321630498X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27567093/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.08.295; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321630498X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","HAP","CAP","CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAP patients","influenza season","categories of patients","half of patients","proportion of patients","ICU","prevalence of influenza","presence of respiratory viruses","consecutive CAP","respiratory virus infections","suspected pneumonia","respiratory tract specimens","clinical practice of diagnostic testing","virus diagnostic tests","suspected community","Study design Prospective observational study","intensive care unit","tertiary care hospitals","presence of viral pathogens","Abstract Background Clinical guidelines","PCR","Netherlands","elevated CRP","leucopenia","Objective","summer","Results","total","Conclusions","groups","comorbidities"],"language":"en"},

Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5\u20135.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (\u201Cmigrating action potential complexes\u201D) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena. These findings suggest that infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus disrupts organized propulsive activity in the jejunum of the neonatal pig.","publish_time":"1984-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burrows, Colin F.; Merritt, A.

It is characterized by destruction of the underlying lung parenchyma resulting in multiple small, thin-walled cavities and is often accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. REVIEW: NP in children was first reported in children in 1994, and since then there has been a gradual increase in cases, which is partially explained by greater physician awareness and use of contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, and by temporal changes in circulating respiratory pathogens and antibiotic prescribing. The most common pathogens detected in children with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood, but likely relate to multiple host susceptibility and bacterial virulence factors, with viral\u2013bacterial interactions also possibly having a role. Most cases are in previously healthy young children who, despite adequate antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia, remain febrile and unwell. Many also have evidence of pleural effusion, empyema, or pyopneumothorax, which has undergone drainage or surgical intervention without clinical improvement. The diagnosis is generally made by chest imaging, with CT scans being the most sensitive, showing loss of normal pulmonary architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and multiple thin-walled cavities. Blood culture and culture and molecular testing of pleural fluid provide a microbiologic diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. Prolonged antibiotics, draining pleural fluid and gas that causes mass effects, and maintaining ventilation, circulation, nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte balance are critical components of therapy. Despite its serious nature, death is uncommon, with good clinical, radiographic and functional recovery achieved in the 5\u20136 months following diagnosis. Increased knowledge of NP\u2019s pathogenesis will assist more rapid diagnosis and improve treatment and, ultimately, prevention. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider that our understanding of NP is limited to individual case reports or small case series, and treatment data from randomized-controlled trials are lacking. Furthermore, case series are retrospective and usually confined to single centers. Consequently, these studies may not be representative of patients in other locations, especially when allowing for temporal changes in pathogen behaviour and differences in immunization schedules and antibiotic prescribing practices.","publish_time":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masters, I.

Shortening outbreak reporting lags has the potential to improve global health by preventing local outbreaks from escalating into global epidemics. Methods: Reporting lags between the first record and the first public report of an event were calculated for 318 outbreaks occurring 1996-2009. The influence of freedom of the press, Internet usage, per capita health expenditure, and cell phone subscriptions, on the timeliness of outbreak reporting was evaluated. Results: Freer presses and increasing Internet usage correlate with reduced time between the first record of an outbreak and the public report. Increasing Internet usage reduced the expected reporting lag from more than one month in nations without Internet users to one day in those where 75 of 100 people use the Internet.

METHODS: We described characteristics of AdV pneumonia (n = 91) versus non\u2010AdV pneumonia (n = 55) and compared clinico\u2010laboratory and radiological characteristics in patient groups categorized by RF. RESULTS: All 91 AdV pneumonia patients presented with acute respiratory symptoms and radiological infiltrations and had significantly lower levels of white blood cell counts and platelet counts compared with non\u2010AdV pneumonia. Of them, 67 patients had mild pneumonia without RF (non\u2010RF), 14 patients had no RF at admission but progressed to RF during hospitalization (progressed to RF) and 10 patients had RF at admission (initial RF). Initial monocyte percentage and absolute monocyte counts in RF patient groups (progressed to RF and initial RF) were significantly lower than those of non\u2010RF patients (both P \u003C 0.001), and the differences among progressed to RF and initial RF patients were not significant. Chest computed tomography findings such as dominant pattern or distribution, clinical symptoms, and bacterial or viral co\u2010infections other than AdV were not discriminable between patients who had RF and those who did not.

Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns.

This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Staffing along epidemiologic considerations may reduce HCW shortage by leveling the nadir of affected workforce. Although this requires considerable efforts and commitment of staff, it may be essential in an effort to best maintain staff health and operational functionality of health care facilities and systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mascha, Edward J.; Schober, Patrick; Schefold, Joerg C.; Stueber, Frank; Luedi, Markus M.","journal":"Anesth Analg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c89e929e28a1db3d3cfb507159c2069c0a65ecea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173088.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["staff health","staff shortage","probability of infection","infection probability","commitment of staff","staff ratio","specialized staff","Pandemic-adjusted staffing","staffing reduction","Health care worker","hospital staff infections","functionality of health care institutions","employee health","optimal staffing models","Various staffing models","pandemic model","operational functionality of health care facilities","HCW shortage","typical routine staffing model","given week","reduced workforce shortage","intensive care unit","days","Coronavirus Disease","bed ICU","nadir of affected workforce","safety","well-being","epidemiologic considerations","light of lacking evidence","full-time employment","pivotal importance","wk","fatality","BACKGROUND","systems","total period","quarantine time","hour shifts","COVID","comprehensive statistical modeling","CONCLUSIONS","considerable efforts","Potential","METHODS","epidemiology","patient","RESULTS","account","Maximum effects","Simulations"],"language":"en"},

Among pilgrims with a cough, 69.4% took antibiotics. The prevalence of cough was significantly higher among females than men, but age, chronic conditions and preventive measures had no significant effect. Conclusions The Hajj cough is highly common, likely a result of crowded conditions at religious places. Pilgrims should be advised to carry symptomatic relief for the Hajj cough such as cough suppressant, soothing throat lozenges and paracetamol.

The development of broad antiviral spectrum hand disinfectants with activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses is limited due to a small number of permissible active ingredients able to inactivate viruses. METHODS: A new hand disinfectant was developed based upon 69.39 % w/w ethanol and 3.69 % w/w 2-propanol. Different amounts of citric acid and urea were added in order to create a virucidal claim against poliovirus (PV), adenovirus type 5 (AdV) and polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) as non-enveloped test viruses in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) as soil load. The exposure time was fixed to 60 s. RESULTS: With the addition of 2.0 % citric acid and 2.0 % urea an activity against the three test viruses was achieved demonstrating a four log(10) reduction of viral titers. Furthermore, this formulation was able to inactivate PV, AdV, SV40 and murine norovirus (MNV) in quantitative suspension assays according to German and European Guidelines within 60 s creating a virucidal claim. For inactivation of vaccinia virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus 15 s exposure time were needed to demonstrate a 4 log(10) reduction resulting in a claim against enveloped viruses. Additionally, it is the first hand disinfectant passing a carrier test with AdV and MNV. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this new formulation with a low alcohol content, citric acid and urea is capable of inactivating all enveloped and non-enveloped viruses as indicated in current guidelines and thereby contributing as valuable addition to the hand disinfection portfolio.","publish_time":"2016-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ionidis, Georgios; H\u00FCbscher, Judith; Jack, Thomas; Becker, Britta; Bischoff, Birte; Todt, Daniel; Hodasa, Veronika; Brill, Florian H.

The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants.

HYPOTHESIS: A modified live feline herpesvirus\u20101 (FHV\u20101) and feline calicivirus (FCV) intranasal vaccine will reduce clinical signs of disease caused by experimental infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica. ANIMALS: Twenty specific pathogen\u2010free 12\u2010week\u2010old kittens. METHODS: Experimental study. Cats were randomized into 2 groups of 10 cats each. The vaccinated group was administered a single intranasal dose of a commercially available vaccine containing modified live strains of FHV\u20101 and FCV, and the control group remained unvaccinated. All 20 cats were administered B. bronchiseptica by nasal inoculation 7 days later and were observed daily for clinical signs of illness for 20 days. RESULTS: In the first 10 days after B. bronchiseptica challenge, vaccinated cats were less likely to be clinically ill than control cats with a median clinical score of 0/180 (range 0\u20135) versus 2/180 (range 0\u20138) (P = .01).

Genetic modification (GM) techniques facilitate the design of \u2019smarter\u2019 vaccines. For many of the major infectious diseases of humans, like AIDS and malaria, but also for most human neoplastic disorders, still no vaccines are available. It may be speculated that novel GM technologies will significantly contribute to their development. While a promising number of studies is conducted on GM vaccines and GM vaccine technologies, the contribution of GM technology to newly introduced vaccines on the market is disappointingly limited. In this study, the field of vector-based GM vaccines is explored. Data on currently available, actually applied, and newly developed vectors is retrieved from various sources, synthesised and analysed, in order to provide an overview on the use of vector-based technology in the field of GM vaccine development. While still there are only two vector-based vaccines on the human vaccine market, there is ample activity in the fields of patenting, preclinical research, and different stages of clinical research. Results of this study revealed that vector-based vaccines comprise a significant part of all GM vaccines in the pipeline. This study further highlights that poxviruses and adenoviruses are among the most prominent vectors in GM vaccine development. After the approval of the first vectored human vaccine, based on a flavivirus vector, vaccine vector technology, especially based on poxviruses and adenoviruses, holds great promise for future vaccine development. It may lead to cheaper methods for the production of safe vaccines against diseases for which no or less perfect vaccines exist today, thus catering for an unmet medical need.

We therefore conducted this study to determine the burden of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and describe its clinical and therapeutic aspects among SCD children in Cameroon, a SSA country. METHODS: This was a retrospective study carried-out from September 2013 to June 2014 at the SCD unit of the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation, a pediatric reference centre in Yaound\u00E9, Cameroon. We enrolled all SCD children with confirmed diagnosis of ACS, and recorded their clinical presentation at admission along with their evolution during hospitalization. RESULTS: Twenty one cases of ACS were identified during the study period, from 338 hospitalizations of children with SCD. Ages ranged from 11 months to 16 years with a mean (standard deviation) of 5.5 (3.4) years, and a male/female sex ratio of 3.2/1. We noticed relatively low levels of HbF, from 6.4 to 21.9 % with a mean of 14.6 % (6.0 %). The three main symptoms at admission were fever (90.5 %), cough (81 %) and chest pains (28.6 %). Two patients (9.5 %) developed ACS 2 days after admission. The mean values of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum CRP, serum LDH and hemoglobin were respectively 32479.4 (17862.3)/mm(3), 23476 (11543.7)/mm(3), 228.2 (132.6) mg/l, 3452.3 (2916.3) IU/l and 6.5 (1.2) g/dl. The main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations were the lower lobes (90.5 %). Treatment associated broad-spectrum antibiotics (100 %), hydration (100 %), analgesics (43.2 %), whole blood transfusion (66.7 %), and oxygen supplementation (33.3 %). Blood transfusion significantly improved hemoglobin level (p = 0.039). The duration of hospitalization, the mean of which was 6.8 (3.1) days, was influenced by none of the tested variables (all p values \u003E 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACS is frequent among SCD children in our milieu. Its etiologies seem to be multifactorial. Patients\u2019 parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences.","publish_time":"2015-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nansseu, Jobert Richie N.; Alima Yanda, Anastasie Nicole; Chelo, David; Tatah, Sandra A.; Mbassi Awa, Hubert D.; Seungue, Judith; Koki, Paul Olivier N.","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c568d47a1d134908dc09e454a5a52655d3a9434.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4578678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-015-0454-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCD","Chantal Biya Foundation","ACS","IU"],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["SCD children","magnitude of SCD","SCD unit","cases of ACS","admission","confirmed diagnosis of ACS","hospitalizations of children","mean values of leukocytes","Cameroon","p values","main symptoms","years","study period","blood transfusion","retrospective study","days","Child Centre","serum CRP","serum LDH","clinical presentation","SSA country","related complications","chest pains","duration of hospitalization","pediatric reference centre","improved hemoglobin level","sickle cell disease","related catastrophic consequences","burden of acute chest syndrome","main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations","Chantal Biya Foundation","neutrophils","Mother","therapeutic aspects","lower lobes","Yaound\u00E9","fever","early signs","female sex ratio","topic","region","BACKGROUND","sub-Saharan Africa","dearth of research","tested variables","evolution","months","standard deviation","broad-spectrum antibiotics","hydration","low levels of HbF","Treatment","cough","METHODS","RESULTS","milieu","CONCLUSION","Patients\u2019 parents","oxygen supplementation","etiologies","analgesics","Ages","clinicians","IU"],"language":"en"},

This paper reports on a 2001\u20132003 survey of management practices of the five waste contractors servicing just over half of the veterinarians in Durban, South Africa\u2019s second largest city. Some of their activities, when evaluated in terms of the legislation, guidelines and policies relating to waste handling and disposal, were found to be non-compliant. Since any discussion on waste management should take cognisance of waste from generation to final disposal, the responsibility of veterinarians as waste generators is also discussed in the light of the recent developments in health care waste management in South Africa. This study presents a review of past and current policies, legislation and guidelines that have application to veterinary waste.

Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a \u201Clog-odds\u201D matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix.

These viruses have been emerging in many locations throughout the tropics and subtropics. Like many plant viruses, they are often not recognized by plant diagnostic clinics due in large part to the lack of rapid and cost effective assays. An isothermal amplification assay, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), was evaluated for its ability to detect three begomoviruses and for its suitability for use in plant diagnostic clinics. Methods for DNA extraction and separation of amplicons from proteins used in the assay were modified and compared to RPA manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The modified RPA assays were compared to PCR assays for sensitivity, use in downstream applications, cost, and speed. RESULTS: Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays for the detection of Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, Tomato mottle virus and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were specific, only amplifying the target viruses in three different host species. RPA was able to detect the target virus when the template was in a crude extract generated using a simple inexpensive extraction method, while PCR was not. Separation of RPA-generated amplicons from DNA-binding proteins could be accomplished by several methods, all of which were faster and less expensive than that recommended by the manufacturer. Use of these modifications resulted in an RPA assay that was faster than PCR but with a similar reagent cost. This modified RPA was the more cost effective assay when labor is added to the cost since RPA can be performed much faster than PCR. RPA had a sensitivity approximate to that of ELISA when crude extract was used as template. RPA-generated amplicons could be used in downstream applications (TA cloning, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, direct sequencing) similar to PCR but unlike some other isothermal reactions. CONCLUSIONS: RPA could prove useful for the cost effective detection of plant viruses by plant diagnostic clinics. It can be performed in one hour or less with a reagent cost similar to that of PCR but with a lower labor cost, and with an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity.

For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.

To establish a basis for a molecular understanding of the biology of filoviruses in the reservoir host, we have adapted a set of molecular tools for investigation of filovirus replication in a recently developed cell line, R06E, derived from the species Rousettus aegyptiacus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Upon infection with Ebola or Marburg viruses, R06E cells produced viral titers comparable to VeroE6 cells, as shown by TCID(50) analysis. Electron microscopic analysis of infected cells revealed morphological signs of filovirus infection as described for human- and monkey-derived cell lines. Using R06E cells, we detected an unusually high amount of intracellular viral proteins, which correlated with the accumulation of high numbers of filoviral nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. We established protocols to produce Marburg infectious virus-like particles from R06E cells, which were then used to infect na\u00EFve target cells to investigate primary transcription. This was not possible with other cell lines previously tested. Moreover, we established protocols to reliably rescue recombinant Marburg viruses from R06E cells.

Different agents causing neonatal diarrhoea, E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella and Cryptosporidium were systematically researched in faeces. 1. Suckling calves: In 40 livestock farms selected for diarrhoea, 311 calves 4 to 10 days old which had diarrhoea for less than 24h or no diarrhoea, were included in the study. A prophylaxis of neonatal diarrhoea had been carried out in 21 of the 40 livestock farms. On D0 (inclusion day), the mean age was 6 days, 82% presented a good initial general condition and 76.2% had a good appetite; 48.6% were diarrhoeic but 91.3% presented no sign of dehydration. Only 6.1% were infected by E. coli K99, 14.3% by rotavirus, 6.8% by coronavirus, 0.3% by Salmonella but 50% excreted C. parvum oocysts. This later percentage increases up to 84% and 86% by D3 and D7, respectively . We note that 16% of the 4-day-old calves on D0 are excreting oocysts and this percentage increases as a function of the age of the calf on D0 to reach 90% to 95% by the age of 8 days. 10 out of 12 dead calves excreted C. parvum oocysts. From D0 to D14 the other pathogen agents show a relative or a decreasing stability. 2. Dairy calves: 382 calves which had diarrhoea for less than 24h or no diarrhoea, aged 8 to 15 days coming from six industrial livestock farms were included in the study. On D0, 99% of the calves presented a good initial general condition, 99.7% had a good appetite and no calf was dehydrated. At this date (D0), 16.8% of the calves excreted cryptosporidia. This percentage increases up to 23% and 51.8% on D3 and D8, respectively, then decreases to 31.9% on D14. The pressure of the other pathogenic agents remains relatively stable, excepted for rotavirus on D7 (from 9.9% on D0 to 27.2% on D7, then 12.6% on D14) which does not explain the concomitant peak in diarrhoea because the infection by rotavirus on D7 is more frequent in non-diarrhoeic calves than in diarrhoeic calves. Our results show that Cryptosporidium prevalence is higher in suckling than in dairy calves and C. parvum constitutes actually in both cases the major aetiological agent of neonatal diarrhoea.","publish_time":"1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naciri, Muriel; Paul Lefay, Marie; Mancassola, Roselyne; Poirier, Pierre; Chermette, Ren\u00E9","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/380469cdbf2999dc4d165cbed03b008549cc93a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131162.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401799001119; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401799001119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["diarrhoea of neonatal calves","dairy calves","Suckling calves","dead calves","day-old calves","D0","non-diarrhoeic calves","prophylaxis of neonatal diarrhoea","rotavirus","D7","parvum oocysts","major aetiological agent of neonatal diarrhoea","good appetite","percentage increases","D14","study","importance of Cryptosporidium parvum","good initial general condition","days old","industrial livestock farms","Cryptosporidium prevalence","pathogen agents","pathogenic agents","Different agents","Salmonella","mean age","coronavirus","calf","later percentage","D3","coli K99","cases","infection","types of breeding","inclusion day","function","results","concomitant peak","decreasing stability","pressure","France","sign of dehydration","D8","faeces","date","cryptosporidia"],"language":"en"},

While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluated evidence from previous clinical trials that evaluated nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summaries our observations. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed\u00AE, Web of Science\u00AE and SciVerse Scopus\u00AE. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. RESULTS: total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.

That is accomplished by means of their enzyme activity. Recently, membrane-bound peptidases have also been shown to act as receptors, receiving signals from as yet undefined ligands and transducing them into the cell interior. By using either or both of these mechanisms, peptidases interact with fundamental cellular functions: growth, differentiation, activation and death. This study addressed the effects of a T-cell derived cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) on the activity of aminopeptidase N (APN), an ectoenzyme processing several signal peptides. Cells of a myelo-monocytic cell line HL-60 were used as a model system, and APN was assayed at the levels of mRNA, its membrane marker CD13, and the enzyme activity. Regulation of CD13/APN by IFN-\u03B3 was found at all three levels. The direction of regulation was time-dependent: an initial down-regulation seen 24 and 48 hrs after the onset of treatment with IFN-\u03B3 was replaced by an up-regulation after 72 and/or 96 hrs. Up-regulation of CD13/APN observed after 96 hrs was preceded by an up-regulation of APN mRNA reaching its maximum after 72 hrs. The IFN-\u03B3-induced regulation of APN was due to membrane aminopeptidase N, since it could be completely abrogated by an APN blocking antibody WM-15. The delayed up-regulation of CD13/APN (observed after 72 and/or 96 hrs), required de novo protein synthesis as it could be abrogated by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Possible role of endogenous (IFN-\u03B3-induced) TGF-\u03B2 in mediating CD13/APN up-regulation could be excluded, since no TGF-\u03B2 was found in supernatants of IFN-\u03B3 treated HL-60 cells. Thus, our data show regulation of CD13/APN on cells of myelo-monocytic origin by a T-cell derived cytokine, IFN-\u03B3. A similar mechanism might play a role in inflammation.","publish_time":"2005-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabrilovac, Jelka; Breljak, Davorka; \u010Cupi\u0107, Barbara; Ambriovi\u0107-Ristov, Andreja","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ea5771f0aa7465576db06da2d161c0babd17cce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094246.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505000664; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320505000664","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Regulation of CD13","regulation of APN mRNA","induced regulation of APN","IFN-\u03B3","direction of regulation","supernatants of IFN","membrane marker CD13","mediating CD13","APN blocking antibody WM","hrs","regulation of local concentrations of various signalling peptides","membrane aminopeptidase N","T-cell derived cytokine","cell interior","Abstract Membrane-bound peptidases","cells of myelo","enzyme activity","activity of aminopeptidase N","myelo-monocytic cell line","TGF-\u03B2","levels of mRNA","inhibitor of protein synthesis","novo protein synthesis","growth factors","monocytic origin","signal peptides","Possible role of endogenous","important roles","interferon-gamma","differentiation","fundamental cellular functions","time-dependent","hormones","chemokines","activation","effects","ectoenzyme","onset of treatment","maximum","signals","cytokines","death","mechanisms","cycloheximide","data","undefined ligands","similar mechanism","inflammation","study","model system","receptors"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate anti\u2010bacterial and anti\u2010allergen antibody responses during convalescence from asthma exacerbation and differences found in exacerbations associated with and without viral infection. Results IgE antibodies to the P6 bacterial antigen increased in 60% of sera during convalescence and for many children achieved titres as high as IgE titres to allergens. In contrast IgE anti\u2010HDM titres declined during convalescence. The anti\u2010bacterial IgE titres were the same in subjects with and without virus infection while the anti\u2010HDM IgE declined more rapidly in virus\u2010infected subjects. IgG titres to the major HDM allergens showed no consistent increase and the overall IgG anti\u2010HDM titres even declined in subjects without a virus infection. Anti\u2010bacterial IgG antibodies in contrast to IgE did not change. Patients with frequent episodic or persistent asthma had similar IgE anti\u2010bacterial titres to patients with infrequent asthma during the acute phase, although they had reduced IgG titres to both the bacteria and the HDM. Conclusions During the period following an acute exacerbation of asthma there was a marked and specific increase in anti\u2010bacterial IgE compared with a reduced IgE response to HDM.

However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species. We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Zhiqi; Xu, Yanfeng; Bao, Linlin; Zhang, Ling; Yu, Pin; Qu, Yajin; Zhu, Hua; Zhao, Wenjie; Han, Yunlin; Qin, Chuan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05192151667b1bb4e3405de11f6e4ae2f844e7c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","current animal models","harmless respiratory pathogens","reproducible animal models","suitable animal models","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","treatment of SARS","pathogenesis","outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection","result of zoonotic CoVs","CoVs global attention","species barrier","spike proteins","S proteins","various species","current understanding","infectious pathogens","diverse host affinity","potential role of host receptors","high pathogenicity","function","importance","mortality rates","human populations","pivotal structure","epidemiology","details","prevention","international borders","surface","humans","countermeasures","emerging coronaviral diseases","pathogenic mechanism","review","Coronaviruses","research"],"language":"en"},

With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats. Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention. RESULTS: Progress in studying bat reservoir host responses to virus infection is hampered by the lack of host-specific reagents required for immunological studies. In order to establish a basis for the design of reagents, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome. We performed de novo transcriptome assembly using deep RNA sequencing data from 11 distinct tissues from one male and one female bat. We observed high similarity between this transcriptome and those available from other bat species. Gene expression analysis demonstrated clustering of expression profiles by tissue, where we also identified enrichment of tissue-specific gene ontology terms. In addition, we identified and experimentally validated the expression of novel coding transcripts that may be specific to this species. CONCLUSION: We comprehensively characterized the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome de novo. This transcriptome will be an important resource for understanding bat immunology, physiology, disease pathogenesis, and virus transmission.

HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans. Methods Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests. Results Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of \u22651:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of \u003C1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein.

Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P\u003C0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P\u003E0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, L; Liu, H G; Liu, W; Liu, J; Liu, K; Shang, J; Deng, Y; Wei, S","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32026671/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alanine"],"organizations":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV pneumonia","increased expression of IL","serum creatinine","clinical symptoms","clinical characteristics","groups","serum inflammatory cytokines","severe group","prognosis of patients","serum lactate dehydrogenase","critical group","Clinical data","clinical classification","underlying disease","disease progresses","decreased lymphocyte count","blood test","expression levels of inflammatory cytokines","significant differences","significant changes","serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha","expression levels of interleukin","CT imaging characteristics","common viral pneumonia","CT findings of typical cases","white blood cell count","solid shadow","hs-CRP","LDH","main symptoms","severity","stripe shadow","systemic symptoms","High resolution CT","aspartate aminotransferase","Alanine aminotransferase","normal procalcitonin","multiple patchy ground glass shadows","isolation ward of Tongji hospital","Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science","AST","great value","Tbil","total bilirubin","general information","ALT","hypersensitive C reactive protein","TNF-\u03B1","receptor","correlation","markers","septal thickening","co-bacterial infection","novel coronavirus","differential diagnosis","Scr","items","Technology","scope","lesion","relevant diagnostic criteria","mildgroup","relationship","indicators","Objective","Conclusion","fever","study subjects","Results","Methods","albumin"],"language":"en"},

Following bioactivity-guided fractionation, eight diterpenoids (1\u20138) and four biflavonoids (9\u201312) were isolated and evaluated for SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. Of these compounds, the biflavone amentoflavone (9) (IC50 =8.3\u03BCM) showed most potent 3CLpro inhibitory effect.

The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM(2.5) changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM(2.5). Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM(2.5) concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 \u03BCg/m(3) in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi\u0027an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively.

The reductions in emissions of PM(2.5) precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable.

Previously, we reported that skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) obtained from normal unimmunized cows at 6 to 7d after parturition effectively prevented against human rotavirus (HRV)-induced severe gastroenteritis in vivo, when administered as a single dose 60min before viral inoculation. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of multiple administrations of SCBLC at smaller dosages after viral inoculation in vivo. We demonstrate that multiple administrations within 24h after virus inoculation resulted in earlier recovery from diarrheal symptoms, in an administration frequency-dependent manner. Furthermore, we investigated whether isolated IgG anti-HRV activity in SCBLC was equivalent to that of IgG isolated from bovine mature milk as measured by in vitro activity assays. We found that IgG-containing fractions from SCBLC and mature milk exhibited approximately the same level of anti-HRV activity. We concluded that the SCBLC contains a high level of IgG against HRV-induced severe gastroenteritis, which will be possible to use in protective effects in immunocompromised hosts, such as children and the elderly. Multiple doses of SCBLC during the early stages of infection or lower dosage of SCBLC given as a single dose both resulted in relief of diarrheal symptoms.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inagaki, M.; Yamamoto, M.; Cairangzhuoma,; Xijier,; Yabe, T.; Uchida, K.; Kawasaki, M.; Nakagomi, T.; Nakagomi, O.; Minamoto, N.; Kanamaru, Y.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/651b5ec6467cfe2a22518852b7bc366c181608f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094275.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5847; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030212008715; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030212008715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200479/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotavirus"],"organizations":["SCBLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Multiple doses of SCBLC","efficacy of multiple administrations of SCBLC","lower dosage of SCBLC","isolated IgG anti-HRV activity","level of anti-HRV activity","viral inoculation","high level of IgG","virus inoculation","bovine mature milk","single dose","activity assays","important etiologic agent of severe gastroenteritis","relief of diarrheal symptoms","human rotavirus","Abstract Rotavirus","concentrated bovine late colostrum","early stages of infection","smaller dosages","earlier recovery","immunocompromised hosts","protective effects","administration frequency-dependent manner","normal unimmunized cows","fractions","children","parturition","present study","elderly"],"language":"en"},

Of the three major ORFs identified, two were found to encode the major and minor coronavirus membrane proteins M and sM. A potentially single ORF, designated ORF3 according to the pattern of the viral subgenomic mRNAs, could be identified between the S and sM genes. A striking variability, essentially generated by short deletions clustered in a few loci, was observed in the ORF3 of both isolates. The largest predicted polypeptide of 223 amino acids showed homology with polypeptides potentially encoded by other members of the same genetic subset, including two shorter polypeptides of human respiratory virus HCV 229E and one of transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV. This homology suggests that the two HCV ORFs may have originated from a single precursor.

Many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world. Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible; therefore, lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur. This chapter presents a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease. It suggests that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farver, Carol F.; Zander, Dani S.","journal":"Molecular Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d543040173e1afb394ef1d0dae78786769f9dc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158196.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744197000184; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744197000184","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung tissues","review of lung pathology","impairment of lung function","body","Publisher Summary Pulmonary pathology","outside world","noxious agents","defense mechanisms","form of infectious agents","non-neoplastic diseases","large spectrum","inorganic particles","current state of knowledge","widespread effects","development of new therapies","preventive measures","pathogenesis","human takes","role","changes","unusual relationship","clear understanding","morphology","survival","chapter","lungs","result","breath","organs","insults","types","organism","Damage","oxygen"],"language":"en"},

Vitamins A, D, and E, and antimicrobial peptide LL-37 may have immunomodulatory effects. We studied how their serum levels were associated with allergy status, intratonsillar/nasopharyngeal virus detection and intratonsillar expression of T cell- and innate immune response-specific cytokines, transcription factors and type I/II/III interferons in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. METHODS: 110 elective tonsillectomy patients participated. Serum levels of vitamins A, 25(OH)D, and E, LL-37 and allergen-specific IgE as well as nasopharyngeal/intratonsillar respiratory viruses were analyzed. The mRNA expression of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-\u03B2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet in tonsils were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 16 years (range 3\u201360), 28% of subjects had atopy, and 57% carried \u22651 respiratory virus in nasopharynx. Detection of viruses decreased by age. Higher vitamin A levels showed borderline significance with less viral detection (P = 0.056). Higher 25(OH)D was associated with less allergic rhinitis and atopy (P \u003C 0.05) and higher vitamin E with less self-reported allergy (P \u003C 0.05). In gene expression analyses, 25(OH)D was associated with higher IL-37, vitamin A with higher IFN-\u03B3 and vitamin E with less IL-28 (P \u003C 0.05). LL-37 was associated with less FOXP3, RORC2 and IL-17 in tonsils (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and E levels were associated with less allergic disorders. Vitamin A was linked to antiviral and vitamin D with anti-inflammatory activity.

We have shown previously that spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors induces strong antihyperalgesic effect during inflammatory pain. In this study we observed low level of DPP4 mRNA in the rat spinal dorsal horn in physiological conditions, which did not change significantly either in carrageenan-induced inflammatory or partial nerve ligation-generated neuropathic states. In na\u00EFve animals, microglia and astrocytes expressed DPP4 protein with one and two orders of magnitude higher than neurons, respectively. DPP4 significantly increased in astrocytes during inflammation and in microglia in neuropathy. Intrathecal application of two DPP4 inhibitors tripeptide isoleucin-prolin-isoleucin (IPI) and the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin resulted in robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect during inflammation, and milder but significant opioid-independent antihyperalgesic action in the neuropathic model. The opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI was exclusively related to mu-opioid receptors, while vildagliptin affected mainly delta-receptor activity, although mu- and kappa-receptors were also involved. None of the inhibitors influenced allodynia. Our results suggest pathology and glia-type specific changes of DPP4 activity in the spinal cord, which contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and interact with endogenous opioid systems.","publish_time":"2018-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kir\u00E1ly, Korn\u00E9l; Kozsurek, M\u00E1rk; Luk\u00E1csi, Erika; Barta, Benjamin; Alp\u00E1r, Al\u00E1n; Bal\u00E1zsa, Tam\u00E1s; Fekete, Csaba; Szabon, Judit; Helyes, Zsuzsanna; B\u00F6lcskei, Kata; T\u00E9kus, Val\u00E9ria; T\u00F3th, Zsuzsanna E.; Pap, K\u00E1roly; Gerber, G\u00E1bor; Pusk\u00E1r, Zita","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88d9d333b7b85d34405f27fc2e469cad48a1f8c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5823904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29472575/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21799-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DPP4 protein","opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI","mu-opioid receptors","robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect","strong antihyperalgesic effect","DPP4 inhibitors tripeptide isoleucin-prolin","inflammatory pain","significant opioid-independent antihyperalgesic action","endogenous opioid systems","low level of DPP4 mRNA","glia-type specific changes of DPP4 activity","inflammation","spinal cord","neuropathic states","microglia","allodynia","astrocytes","spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase","Altered pain sensations","characteristic features of various pain states","rat spinal dorsal horn","maintenance of hyperalgesia","Intrathecal application","neuropathic model","kappa-receptors","antidiabetic drug vildagliptin","delta-receptor activity","partial nerve ligation","pathology","physiological conditions","orders of magnitude higher","na\u00EFve animals","neurons","results","development","carrageenan","study","neuropathy"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the implemented organization to identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide knowledge essential for further improvement of preparedness. METHOD: According to the Protocol for Reports from Major accidents and Disasters (PRMD) and along with our five scenarios for activation, we analyzed all the data from evaluation reports of all our deployments since the MIH was founded in 1991. RESULTS: The MIH was able to provide group-wise emergency care to military (29 admissions) as well as civilian victims of major incidents and disasters, both national (260) and international (226). Group-wise treatment was advantageous for quarantine, logistics, registration, emotional support and (pre)arrangements for family, media and security. Strong points are preparedness and availability of a dedicated facility, including ICU, X-ray and OR facilities, irrespective of MRSA status and prearranged cooperation, e.g., with a trauma centre, poison centre and the military. Evaluation, research and training resulted in a barcode registration system and continuous adaptations to improve preparedness. Shortage of resources did not occur; use of the MIH\u2019s available resources for national incidents though, could be further optimized. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for the future are: improvement of imbedding in regional and national procedures, continued dedicated time and staff for training, research and development, improvement of nuclear/biological/chemical decontamination facilities and preparedness, implementation of standardized scoring systems and expansion of registration systems to the prehospital setting.

We studied the health status and factors associated with the growth of beef calves in six cow-calf herds during the first month of the calves\u2019 lives and at weaning age (200 days). The six herds were visited three times, when calves were approximately 3 days, 16 days and 30 days of age. On each visit calves (n=37) were clinically examined, weighed or measured, blood samples were collected, faecal samples obtained and deep nasopharyngeal swabs were taken. Each blood sample was analysed for acute phase proteins (haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, fibrinogen), total proteins and albumin, the faecal sample for intestinal tract pathogens (rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella, oocysts of Eimeria coccidia and Cryptosporidium, and nematode eggs), and the nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory tract pathogens (bovine coronavirus (BCV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bacteria and mycoplasma). Clinical diagnosis of respiratory tract disease, diarrhoea or umbilical disease was set at 15.0% for all the three consecutive examinations combined (n=107), but only few pathogens were detected from the samples. The increased levels of acute phase proteins were neither associated with any of the diseases nor with the pathogens. Random intercept linear models were used to explore factors affecting early (3\u201330 days) and long-term (3\u2013200 days) growth, showing that calves with elevated serum amyloid-A concentrations at the age of 16 days had lower long-term growth. Increased albumin concentration at 30 days of age and higher parity of the dam increased early-term growth. The lack of association between a disease and the acute phase protein may stem from the low disease prevalence in the beef calves examined. The measurement of acute phase proteins of a young calf can help identify animals with possible future growth deficiencies, although the mechanisms through which the association between acute phase proteins and growth has yet to be explained.","publish_time":"2016-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sepp\u00E4-Lassila, Leena; Eerola, Ulla; Orro, Toomas; H\u00E4rtel, Heidi; Simojoki, Heli; Autio, Tiina; Pelkonen, Sinikka; Soveri, Timo","journal":"Livest Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6ca85085e4c4b6aaf67d19d9386f43fb48366f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102780.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187114131630275X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288871/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187114131630275X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2016.12.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days of age","growth of beef calves","measurement of acute phase proteins","increased levels of acute phase proteins","thriving calves","visit calves","respiratory tract pathogens","total proteins","early-term growth","lower long-term growth","intestinal tract pathogens","umbilical disease","faecal samples","weaning age","blood samples","Clinical diagnosis of respiratory tract disease","beef calf production","possible future growth deficiencies","bovine coronavirus","young calf","low disease prevalence","cow-calf herds","factors","Increased albumin concentration","respiratory syncytial virus","elevated serum amyloid","lack of association","deep nasopharyngeal swabs","rotavirus","Salmonella","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","BCV","oocysts of Eimeria coccidia","animals","dam","diarrhoea","Cryptosporidium","nematode eggs","RSV","fibrinogen","mechanisms","higher parity","concentrations","haptoglobin","bacteria","calves\u2019 lives","month","Random intercept linear models","health status","mycoplasma","consecutive examinations","times","diseases"],"language":"en"},

Our study represents the first survey of the nasopharynx during a known, controlled viral challenge. We aimed to gain a better understanding of the composition and dynamics of the nasopharyngeal microbiome during viral infection. METHODS: Rhinovirus illnesses were induced by self-inoculation using the finger to nose or eye natural transmission route in ten otherwise healthy young adults. Nasal lavage fluid samples (NLF) samples were collected at specific time points before, during, and following experimental rhinovirus inoculation. Bacterial DNA from each sample (N = 97 from 10 subjects) was subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing by amplifying the V1-V2 hypervariable region followed by sequencing using the 454-FLX platform. RESULTS: This survey of the nasopharyngeal microbiota revealed a highly complex microbial ecosystem. Taxonomic composition varied widely between subjects and between time points of the same subject. We also observed significantly higher diversity in not infected individuals compared to infected individuals. Two genera \u2013 Neisseria and Propionibacterium \u2013 differed significantly between infected and not infected individuals. Certain phyla, including Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, were detected in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the complex and diverse nature of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in both healthy and viral-challenged adults. Although some phyla were common to all samples, differences in levels of diversity and selected phyla were detected between infected and uninfected participants. Deeper, species-level metagenomic sequencing in a larger sample is warranted.","publish_time":"2014-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allen, E Kaitlynn; Koeppel, Alex F; Hendley, J Owen; Turner, Stephen D; Winther, Birgit; Sale, Mich\u00E8le M","journal":"Microbiome","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/758c439d59499b43b598efd59f27574db3595e3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4098959.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028608/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-2618-2-22","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected individuals","nasopharyngeal microbiota","nasopharyngeal microbiome","nasopharynx","selected phyla","viral infection","Certain phyla","viral challenge","subjects","RESULTS","survey","Nasal lavage fluid samples","S rRNA sequencing","healthy young adults","specific time points","experimental rhinovirus inoculation","species-level metagenomic sequencing","levels of diversity","larger sample","higher diversity","Rhinovirus illnesses","self-inoculation","bacterial communities","Bacterial DNA","Taxonomic composition","complex microbial ecosystem","important role","upper respiratory tract infections","NLF","dynamics","eye natural transmission route","finger","differences","diverse nature","V1-V2 hypervariable region","URTIs","Firmicutes","Actinobacteria","better understanding","Proteobacteria","Propionibacterium","uninfected participants","genera","Neisseria","METHODS","BACKGROUND","FLX platform","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

Excluding viruses, M1 aminopeptidases are distributed throughout all phyla, and have been implicated in a wide range of functions including cell maintenance, growth and development, and defense. The structure and catalytic mechanism of M1 aminopeptidases are well understood, and make them ideal candidates for the design of small\u2010molecule inhibitors. As a result, many research groups have assessed their utility as therapeutic targets for both infectious and chronic diseases of humans, and many inhibitors with a range of target specificities and potential therapeutic applications have been developed. Herein, we have aimed to address these studies, to determine whether the family of M1 aminopeptidases does in fact present a universal target for the treatment of a diverse range of human diseases. Our analysis indicates that early validation of M1 aminopeptidases as therapeutic targets is often overlooked, which prevents the enzymes from being confirmed as drug targets. This validation cannot be neglected, and needs to include a thorough characterization of enzymes\u2019 specific roles within complex physiological pathways. Furthermore, any chemical probes used in target validation must be carefully designed to ensure that specificity over the closely related enzymes has been achieved.

The number of confirmed cases and the timing of these outbreaks from May 13 to July 22, 2009 were obtained and subjected to a novel mathematical model to simulate the infection profile (time vs number). The model was predicated upon the grey prediction theory which allows assignment of future trends using limited numbers of data points. During the period of our analysis, the number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Mainland China increased from 1 to 1772. The efficiency of our model to simulate these data points was evaluated using Sum of squares of error (SSE), Relative standard error (RSE), Mean absolute deviation (MAD) and Average relative error (ARE). Results from these analyses were compared to similar calculations based upon the grey prediction algorithm. Using our equation, defined herein as equation D\u2013R, results showed that SSE=6742.00, RSE=10.69, MAD=7.07, ARE=2.47% were all consistent with the D\u2013R algorithm performing well in the estimation of future trends of H1N1 cases in Mainland China. Calculations using the grey theory had no predictive value [ARE for GM(1,1)=\u2212104.63%].

The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees\u2019 perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from China\u2019s multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). METHODS: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers\u2019 knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers\u2019 statutory duties. RESULTS: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. CONCLUSIONS: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers\u2019 knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker\u2019s knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies. Management should also encourage workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance to be more involved in PHE preparedness and response issues.","publish_time":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Mingli; Ning, Ning; Wu, Qunhong; Peters, David H.; Hao, Yanhua; Li, Ye; Wei, Xingang; Kang, Zheng","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/555559ac51210f5ee896ad5d45a6790d52a3e4d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4546225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26293247/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-015-1003-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHE","Health Inspection Institution","HII"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PHE response experience","bottlenecks of PHE response","PHE preparedness","response probability","response issues","emergency response plans","line of emergency response preparedness","overall response rate","perceptions of responsibilities","local public health employees\u2019 perceptions of emergency response responsibilities","correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities","HII workers\u2019 knowledge","backbone of public health emergency","Local health departments","worker\u2019s knowledge","lowest knowledge","indicator of preparedness","school health surveillance","Health Inspection Institution","workers\u2019 statutory duties","CDC","factors","work experience","Role perceptions of individual staff members","departments of food hygiene","Disease Control","given organization","China\u2019s multiple Centers","separation","Heilongjiang","stratified randomized sample survey","Prevention","PHEs","facilities","regulations","province","item combined question","organizational change","study","respondents","challenges","people","law","northeastern China","performance","support","competencies","BACKGROUND","efforts","RESULTS","administered surveys","METHODS","training","aim","quarter","Management","CONCLUSIONS","Data","deficiencies"],"language":"en"},

The causes can be subdivided into three forms on the basis of the neuroanatomical diagnosis: cerebellar, vestibular and sensory (spinal or general proprioceptive) ataxia. The type of ataxia will determine the diagnostic procedures and select the differential diagnoses, and an accurate neuroanatomical diagnosis is therefore essential. The differential diagnosis list can then be further tailored on the basis of patient signalment, clinical presentation and progression. Global importance Irrespective of the world region, most of the causes of generalised ataxia in the cat are similar and many have been identified for a number of years (cerebellar hypoplasia has been recognised since the late 19th century). However, it is the advent of new technology, in particular veterinary access to magnetic resonance imaging, which has resulted in particularly rapid advances in our understanding, investigation and management of these different forms of ataxia. Audience This article introduces the classification of patients with ataxia on the basis of their clinical presentation, discusses the common differential diagnoses associated with each form, and briefly reviews the more important diseases from a clinical perspective.

Recently published data from the Center for Disease Control\u0027s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System indicates that although maternal mortality from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthesia has declined in the United States, the proportion of maternal deaths due to infections has increased. During 1991\u20137 infection accounted for 13.2% of pregnancy-related deaths overall and 36.3% of abortion-related deaths. The greatest infection risk is found in blacks, older women, women without prenatal care, and women with multiple pregnancy. In the United States pregnancy rates are stable or increasing in these groups. Infection is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the fetus and newborn. Many perinatal infections are associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and low birthweight, or cause fetal and neonatal brain injury. Infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, can result in preterm delivery of live-born infants (delivery before 37 weeks gestation), or stillbirth. A multitude of immunologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, physiologic, and anatomic changes influence the likelihood and course of many infections during pregnancy. Some of these changes are intrinsic, and occur in all normal pregnancies, while others occur to varying degrees in normal and abnormal pregnancies.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Polsky, Bruce","journal":"Principles of Gender-Specific Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f83f4d99a6f16380d33bf4dd8d8952d859397ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149697.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742711000472; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742711000472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Disease Control\u0027s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["pregnancy-related deaths","maternal mortality","multiple pregnancy","perinatal infections","United States pregnancy rates","maternal morbidity","Disease Control\u0027s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System","proportion of maternal deaths","older women","abortion-related deaths","major cause of morbidity","greatest infection risk","peripartum care","prenatal care","anatomic changes","abnormal pregnancies","preterm delivery of live","Center","low birthweight","intra-uterine growth retardation","infants","advances","blacks","chorioamnionitis","course","endocrinologic","weeks gestation","Publisher Summary","anesthesia","likelihood","hemorrhage","embolism","multitude of immunologic","published data","neonatal brain injury","degrees","bacterial vaginosis","fetus","stillbirth","newborn","developed countries","groups"],"language":"en"},

The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes, however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography (TEG) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events. Methods Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 diagnoses that had TEG analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure. Results Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted VTE with an AUROC of .742 (p=0.021). A D-Dimer cutoff of 2600 ng/ml predicted need for dialysis with an AUROC of .779 (p=0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004). Conclusions Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wright, Franklin L.; Vogler, Thomas O.; Moore, Ernest E.; Moore, Hunter B.; Wohlauer, Max V.; Urban, Shane; Nydam, Trevor L.; Moore, Peter K.; McIntyre, Robert C.","journal":"J.

A major limitation in the comparability of the data available is attributed to the differences in diagnostic techniques employed and cat populations sampled. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. infantum infection in owned cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and the identification of potential risk factors. Blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum, by an immunofluorescence antibody test and for the parasites\u2019 DNA, by real-time PCR. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. An overall cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and/or qPCR (0.8%), with a higher rate (10.5%) in southern Italy. The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was significantly associated to the geographical areas (South vs North and Centre; p\u003C0.0001), age class (from 19 months to 6 years old vs \u226418 months old, p = 0.0003), neutering status (not neutered vs neutered, p = 0.0028) and FIV infection (p = 0.0051).Though the role of cats in the epidemiology of L. infantum is still debated, our findings indicate that cats are exposed to and/or infected by this protozoan, mainly in endemic regions of Italy. Hence, a standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats and for screening cat population is crucial for a better understanding of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis, and of the potential role of cats in the transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iatta, Roberta; Furlanello, Tommaso; Colella, Vito; Tarallo, Viviana Domenica; Latrofa, Maria Stefania; Brianti, Emanuele; Trerotoli, Paolo; Decaro, Nicola; Lorusso, Eleonora; Schunack, Bettina; Mir\u00F2, Guadalupe; Dantas-Torres, Filipe; Otranto, Domenico","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c4f848837c2e8eaf750682d4195cc9076d0cef5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6667148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306417/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North"],"keyphrases":["infantum prevalence","owned cats","Leishmania infantum infection","potential role of cats","FIV infection","prevalence of","southern Italy","epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis","neutered vs","prevalence data","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","years old vs","months old","risk of","endemic regions of Italy","South vs North","clinical cases of leishmaniasis","cat populations","identification of potential risk factors","data available","Blood samples","transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis","screening cat population","better understanding","molecular tests","FeLV","parasites\u2019 DNA","prompt diagnosis of","differences","large variability","geographical areas","Centre","immunofluorescence antibody test","Mediterranean basin","proviral DNAs","comparability","diagnostic techniques","neutering status","real-time PCR","standardization of procedures","age class","major limitation","protozoan","countries","study","antibodies","findings","higher rate","aim","serology","qPCR"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, yield losses due to fungal infection, like Uromyces appendiculatus (bean rust), have strong consequences. Several resistant genes were identified that confer resistance to bean rust infection. However, the downstream genes and mechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized. RESULTS: A subtractive bean cDNA library composed of 10,581 unisequences was constructed and enriched in sequences regulated by either bean rust race 41, a virulent strain, or race 49, an avirulent strain on cultivar Early Gallatin carrying the resistance gene Ur-4. The construction of this library allowed the identification of 6,202 new bean ESTs, significantly adding to the available sequences for this plant. Regulation of selected bean genes in response to bean rust infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Plant gene expression was similar for both race 41 and 49 during the first 48 hours of the infection process but varied significantly at the later time points (72\u201396 hours after inoculation) mainly due to the presence of the Avr4 gene in the race 49 leading to a hypersensitive response in the bean plants. A biphasic pattern of gene expression was observed for several genes regulated in response to fungal infection. CONCLUSION: The enrichment of the public database with over 6,000 bean ESTs significantly adds to the genomic resources available for this important crop plant. The analysis of these genes in response to bean rust infection provides a foundation for further studies of the mechanism of fungal disease resistance. The expression pattern of 90 bean genes upon rust infection shares several features with other legumes infected by biotrophic fungi. This finding suggests that the P. vulgaris-U. appendiculatus pathosystem could serve as a model to explore legume-rust interaction.","publish_time":"2009-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thibivilliers, Sandra; Joshi, Trupti; Campbell, Kimberly B; Scheffler, Brian; Xu, Dong; Cooper, Bret; Nguyen, Henry T; Stacey, Gary","journal":"BMC Plant Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8013bbf01944aa3f25d0faf16386ea51c7586066.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2684537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19397807/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-9-46","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phaseolus","P. vulgaris-U"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bean rust infection","bean resistance","bean rust race","common bean","bean plants","fungal infection","new bean ESTs","Regulation of selected bean genes","infection process","subtractive bean cDNA library","downstream genes","resistant genes","legume-rust interaction","Plant gene expression","resistance gene Ur","hypersensitive response","Avr4 gene","biphasic pattern of gene expression","expression pattern","important crop plant","mechanism of fungal disease resistance","important legume crop","available sequences","vulgaris-","hours","avirulent strain","Uromyces appendiculatus","appendiculatus pathosystem","Phaseolus vulgaris","genomic resources available","cultivar Early Gallatin","studies","model","identification","features","foundation","mechanisms","public database","legumes","world","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","unisequences","enrichment","later time points","presence","soybean","qRT-PCR","strong consequences","biotrophic fungi","CONCLUSION","inoculation","construction","losses","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Calculation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases during the course of an epidemic tends to result in a biased CFR. The present study develops a simple method to obtain an unbiased estimate of confirmed CFR (cCFR), using only the confirmed cases as the denominator, at an early stage of epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. We first examine the approach by analyzing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) with known unbiased cCFR estimate, and then investigate published epidemiological datasets of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the USA and Canada (2009). Because observation of a few deaths alone does not permit estimating the distribution of the time from onset to death, the uncertainty is addressed by means of sensitivity analysis. The maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased cCFR for influenza may lie in the range of 0.16\u20134.48% within the assumed parameter space for a factor of underestimation. The estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. Even when there have been no deaths, our model permits estimating a conservative upper bound of the cCFR. CONCLUSIONS: Although one has to keep in mind that the cCFR for an entire population is vulnerable to its variations among sub-populations and underdiagnosis, our method is useful for assessing virulence at the early stage of an epidemic and for informing policy makers and the public.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Klinkenberg, Don; Roberts, Mick; Heesterbeek, Johan A.

A six-month ethnographic study was undertaken in 2012 in the Techiman Municipality of the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, aimed at documenting the trajectories of febrile illness cases of unknown origin occurring within four rural communities. Particular attention was paid to where these trajectories involved the use of formal healthcare facilities and the diagnostic practices that occurred there. Seventy-six participants were enrolled in the study, and 24 complete episodes of illness were documented. While participants routinely used hospital treatment when confronted with enduring or severe illness, the diagnostic process within clinical settings meant that an unusual diagnosis, such as an EID, was unlikely to be considered. Facility-based surveillance is unlikely to be effective in detecting EIDs due to a combination of clinical care practices and the time constraints associated with individual episodes of illness, particularly in the resource-limited settings of rural West Africa, where febrile illness due to malaria is common and specific diagnostic assays are largely unavailable. The success of the \u2018One Health\u0027 approach to EIDs in West Africa is predicated on characterization of accurately diagnosed disease burdens. To this end, we must address inefficiencies in the dominant approaches to EID surveillance and the weaknesses of health systems in the region generally.

It is believed MRSA clones are generated from S. aureus through insertion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and outbreaks occur as they spread. Several worldwide and regional clones have been identified, and their epidemiological, clinical, and genetic characteristics have been described. CA-MRSA is likely able to survive in the community because of suitable SCCmec types (type IV or V), a clone-specific colonization/infection nature, toxin profiles (including Pantone-Valentine leucocidin, PVL), and narrow drug resistance patterns. CA-MRSA infections are generally seen in healthy children or young athletes, with unexpected cases of diseases, and also in elderly inpatients, occasionally surprising clinicians used to HA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA spreads within families and close-contact groups or even through public transport, demonstrating transmission cores. Re-infection (including multifocal infection) frequently occurs, if the cores are not sought out and properly eradicated. Recently, attention has been given to CA-MRSA (USA300), which originated in the US, and is growing as HA-MRSA and also as a worldwide clone. CA-MRSA infection in influenza season has increasingly been noted as well. MRSA is also found in farm and companion animals, and has occasionally transferred to humans. As such, the epidemiological, clinical, and genetic behavior of CA-MRSA, a growing threat, is focused on in this study.","publish_time":"2010-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamamoto, Tatsuo; Nishiyama, Akihito; Takano, Tomomi; Yabe, Shizuka; Higuchi, Wataru; Razvina, Olga; Shi, Da","journal":"J Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee715aa6e08aff0d312956f8668d5c22d1366223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088255.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRSA clones","CA-MRSA infections","CA-MRSA spreads","HA-MRSA infections","genetic behavior of CA","community","infection nature","Re-infection","multifocal infection","worldwide clone","high level of antimicrobial agent use","low level of antimicrobial agent use","genetic characteristics","transmission cores","regional clones","growing threat","suitable SCCmec types","clone-specific colonization","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","toxin profiles","PVL","families","staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec","young athletes","Pantone-Valentine leucocidin","close-contact groups","surprising clinicians","public transport","insertion","healthy children","unexpected cases of diseases","narrow drug resistance patterns","elderly inpatients","influenza season","hospitals","farm","companion animals","outbreaks","USA300","attention","humans","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a subtracted floral cDNA library from floral buds of A. caudigerum was constructed and cDNA arrays by suppression subtractive hybridization were generated. cDNAs of floral buds at different stages before flower opening and of leaves at the seedling stage were used. The macroarray analyses of expression profiles of isolated floral genes showed that 157 genes out of the 612 unique ESTs tested revealed higher transcript abundance in the floral buds and uppermost leaves. Among them, 78 genes were determined to be differentially expressed in the perianth, 62 in the stamens, and 100 genes in the carpels.

Remarkably, APETALA3 (AP3) B-class genes isolated from A. caudigerum were upregulated in the perianth, stamens and carpels, implying that the expression domain of B-class genes in this basal angiosperm was broader than those in their eudicot counterparts.

RESULTS: Decision-making with regard to vaccine policy implementation has been and is still most often driven by fear: fear of disease (when perceived as rampant and/or dangerous), but also fear of vaccine-associated adverse events (when the disease is less or no longer \u201Cvisible\u201D). However, methodology for introducing evidence-based immunisation policies exists and can be used by public health authorities, while vaccination information systems (such as the Swiss InfoVac) have proven their usefulness in providing trustworthy, peer-based knowledge to health-care workers.

We analysed two OAS1 regions encompassing alternatively spliced exons. While the region carrying the splice-site variant is neutrally evolving, a signature of long-standing balancing selection was observed across an alternative exon 7. Analysis of variants in this exon identified an insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs11352835, A/\u2212) that originates predicted products with distinct C termini. This variant is located along the major branch of the haplotype genealogy, suggesting that it may represent the selection target. A case/control study for MS indicated that rs11352835 is associated with disease susceptibility (for an allelic model with the deleted allele predisposing to MS, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.072\u20131.513, p = 0.010). No association was found between rs10774671 and MS. As the two SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium in Europeans, the previously reported association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility might be driven by rs11352835, possibly explaining the contrasting results previously observed for the splice-site polymorphism. Thus, we describe a novel susceptibility variant for MS in OAS1 and show that population genetic analyses can be instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits.

Although vaccines have been used as the principal means of controlling the disease, CD has been reported in vaccinated animals. The hemoagglutinin (H) protein is one of the most important antigens for inducing protective immunity against CD, and antigenic variation of recent CDV strains may explain vaccination failure. In this study, a new CDV isolate (TM-CC) was obtained from a Tibetan Mastiff that died of distemper, and its genome was characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the H gene revealed that the CDV-TM-CC strain is unique among 20 other CDV strains and can be classified into the Asia-1 group with the Chinese strains, Hebei and HLJ1-06, and the Japanese strain, CYN07-hV. The H gene of CDV-TM-CC shows low identity (90.4 % nt and 88.9 % aa) with the H gene of the classical Onderstepoort vaccine strain, which may explain the inability of the Tibetan Mastiff to mount a protective immune response. We also performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the N, P, and F protein sequences, as well as potential N-glycosylation sites and cysteine residues. This analysis shows that an N-glycosylation site at aa 108-110 within the F protein of CDV-TM-CC is specific for the wild-type strains (5804P, A75/17, and 164071) and the Asia-1 group strains, and may be another important factor for the poor immune response. These results provide important information for the design of CD vaccines in the China region and elsewhere.","publish_time":"2014-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Weike; Li, Tiansong; Liu, Yuxiu; Gao, Yuwei; Yang, Songtao; Feng, Na; Sun, Heting; Wang, Shengle; Wang, Lei; Bu, Zhigao; Xia, Xianzhu","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b83b7a705bdd5012b017cfe1c070da3e130e872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089258.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CDV-TM","H gene of CDV","TM-CC","F protein of CDV","CC strain","group strains","antigenic variation of recent CDV strains","new CDV isolate","Chinese strains","design of CD vaccines","wild-type strains","important information","Japanese strain","important factor","important antigens","F protein sequences","protective immune response","Tibetan Mastiff","comprehensive phylogenetic analysis","canine distemper virus","Asia","potential N-glycosylation sites","poor immune response","protective immunity","classical Onderstepoort vaccine strain","incurable disease","multisystemic","cysteine residues","low identity","dogs","carnivores","HLJ1","Hebei","vaccination failure","China region","CYN07-hV","results","principal means","study","A75","inability","vaccinated animals","hemoagglutinin","genome"],"language":"en"},

An actual hospitalization room was the investigate case study. Transient simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM) were performed to investigate the efficiency of the existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) plant with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system. Solid modelling of the room, taking into account thermo-physical properties of building materials, architectural features (e.g., window and wall orientation) and furnishing (e.g., beds, tables and lamps) arrangement of the room, inlet turbulence high induction air diffuser, the return air diffusers and two patients lying on two parallel beds was carried out. Multiphysics modelling was used: a thermo-fluidynamic model (convection-conduction and incompressible Navier-Stokes) was combined with a convection-diffusion model. Three 3D models were elaborated considering different conditions/events of the patients (i.e., the first was considered coughing and/or the second breathing). A particle tracing and diffusion model, connected to cough events, was developed to simulate the dispersal of bacteria-carrying droplets in the isolation room equipped with the existing ventilation system. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of bacteria diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was performed. The analysis of transient simulation results concerning particle path and distance, and then particle tracing combined with their concentration, provided evidence of the formation of zones that should be checked by microclimatic and contaminant control. The present study highlights the fact that the CFD-FEM application is useful for understanding the efficiency, adequacy and reliability of the ventilation system, but also provides important suggestions for controlling air quality, patients\u2019 comfort and energy consumption in a hospital.","publish_time":"2011-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balocco, Carla","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5dd082423cb4059dbc83ca0862918022e4a9f9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation room","air quality","primary air system","existing ventilation system","convection-diffusion model","particle tracing","variable air volume","return air diffusers","thermo-fluidynamic model","actual hospitalization room","thermo-hygrometric conditions","particle path","dispersal of bacteria","efficiency","events","dilution time of bacteria diffusion of coughed gas","inlet turbulence high induction air diffuser","CFD-FEM application","different conditions","convection-conduction","important suggestions","Transient simulations","analysis of transient simulation results","existing heating","case study","present study","parallel beds","Multiphysics modelling","Solid modelling","anaesthetic gas removal","account thermo-physical properties of building materials","airborne bacterial contamination","architectural features","patients\u2019 comfort","arrangement","HVAC","plant","distance","healthcare rooms","VAV","energy consumption","region of droplet fallout","computational fluid dynamics","air-conditioning","fact","adequacy","incompressible Navier-Stokes","window","concentration","lamps","reliability","droplets","finite element method","formation of zones","evidence","tables","D models","wall orientation","contaminant control","Airflow","breathing"],"language":"en"},

The detection of pathogenic RNA viruses is based on modern molecular methods, of which the most widely used methods are the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All steps of RT-PCR and qRT-PCR should be strictly controlled to ensure the validity of obtained results. False-negative results may be caused not only by inhibition of RT or/and PCR steps but also by failure of the nucleic acid extraction step, particularly in the case of viral RNA extraction. The control of nucleic acid extraction generally involves the utilization of a non-pathogenic virus (process control virus) of similar structural properties to those of the target virus. Although in clinical samples the use of such process control virus is only recommended, in other kinds of settings such as food matrices its use is necessary. Currently, several different process control viruses are used for these purposes. Process control viruses can also be constructed artificially using technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles, which have many advantages in comparison with other used controls and are especially suited for controlling the detection and quantification of certain types of RNA viruses. The technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles is theoretically well established, uses the knowledge gained from the study of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 and utilizes many different approaches for the construction of the various process control viruses. Nevertheless, the practical use of MS2 phage-like particles in routine diagnostics is relatively uncommon. The current situation with regard to the use of MS2 phage-like particles as process control viruses in detection of RNA viruses and different methods of their construction, purification and use are summarized and discussed in this review.","publish_time":"2015-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mikel, P.; Vasickova, P.; Kralik, P.","journal":"Food Environ Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d5f57e0e483df4969d44d66699e7ade97cd560d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different process control viruses","various process control viruses","detection of RNA viruses","detection of pathogenic RNA viruses","particles","practical use of MS2 phage","production of MS2 phage","qRT-PCR","control of nucleic acid extraction","PCR steps","quantification of certain types of RNA viruses","different methods","non-pathogenic virus","case of viral RNA extraction","target virus","steps of RT","familiar bacteriophage MS2","construction","different approaches","nucleic acid extraction step","inhibition of RT","technology","used controls","real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","modern molecular methods","pathogenic agents","validity of obtained results","False-negative results","serious infectious diseases","failure","utilization","similar structural properties","food matrices","regard","routine diagnostics","humans","animals","study","advantages","purification","kinds of settings","clinical samples","comparison","current situation","knowledge","purposes","review"],"language":"en"},

Their 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins for viral replication, is a potential target for anti-coronaviral infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we profiled the substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from human CoV NL63 (group 1), human CoV OC43 (group 2a), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (group 2b) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (group 3), by measuring their activity against a substrate library of 19\u00D78 of variants with single substitutions at P5 to P3\u0027 positions. The results were correlated with structural properties like side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensities of substituting residues. All 3CL(pro) prefer Gln at P1 position, Leu at P2 position, basic residues at P3 position, small hydrophobic residues at P4 position, and small residues at P1\u0027 and P2\u0027 positions. Despite 3CL(pro) from different groups of CoVs share many similarities in substrate specificities, differences in substrate specificities were observed at P4 positions, with IBV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Val. By combining the most favorable residues at P3 to P5 positions, we identified super-active substrate sequences \u2018VARLQ\u2193SGF\u2019 that can be cleaved efficiently by all 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 1.7 to 3.2, and \u2018VPRLQ\u2193SGF\u2019 that can be cleaved specifically by IBV 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 4.3. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The comprehensive substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from each of the group 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 CoVs have been profiled in this study, which may provide insights into a rational design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the proteases.","publish_time":"2011-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuck, Chi-Pang; Chow, Hak-Fun; Wan, David Chi-Cheong; Wong, Kam-Bo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc33658b1e2bfebb81adf4b6befe9cb37f6f6f16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3206940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22073294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P4-Pro","P4 positions","comprehensive substrate specificities","P3 position","small residues","substrate library","P2 position","P1 position","basic residues","favorable residues","SARS-CoV","P5 positions","IBV","small hydrophobic residues","super-active substrate sequences","relative activity","human CoV NL63","human CoV OC43","SGF","different groups of CoVs","protein sequences","Leu","potential target","hydrophobicity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","similarities","viral replication","chain volume","rational design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors","infectious bronchitis virus","secondary structure propensities","VARLQ","differences","structural properties","single substitutions","polyproteins","insights","anti-coronaviral infection","variants","SIGNIFICANCE","Gln","proteolytic processing","proteases","CONCLUSIONS","diversity","alphacoronavirus","betacoronavirus","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","results","BACKGROUND","Coronaviruses","study","gammacoronavirus","VPRLQ"],"language":"en"},

Pathogen invasion tipically triggers an inflammatory response where acute phase proteins (APP) have a key role. Pentraxins (PTX) are a family of highly conserved APP that play a part in the host defense against infection. The larger proteins of the family are simply named pentraxins, while c-reactive proteins (CRP) and serum amyloid proteins (SAA, SAP) are known as short pentraxins. Although high APP levels have been broadly associated with bacterial infections, there is a growing body of evidence revealing increased PTX, CRP and SAP expression upon viral infection. Furthermore, CRP, PTX and SAP have shown their potential as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease outcome. Likewise, the measurement of APP levels can be valuable to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines. From the practical point of view, the ability of APP to reduce viral infectivity has been observed in several virus-host models. This has prompted investigation efforts to assess the role of acute phase response proteins as immunoregulatory molecules and their potential as therapeutic reagents.

Aerosol samples were collected, before Deepawali period (BDP, n = 5), during Deepawali period (DDP, n = 5) and after Deepawali period (ADP, n = 5). Bimodal size-distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. Bimodal distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K during DDP. The bimodal size distribution of K was found common for other events because of biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP indicated mixed sources from biomass burning and fireworks. During DDP, K and Ca were well correlated (r(2) = 0.93) together. Strong metal-metal correlations were found between the following pairs, Zn\u2013Fe, Cu\u2013Fe and Cu\u2013Ca, which indicated the similar firecrackers burning source. The atmospheric aging of aerosols was also found significantly high during fireworks days. Aging of aerosols were higher because of heterogeneous reactions of SO(2) and NO(x) on aerosols directly emitted from fireworks. The observed high values of inhalation dose of elemental carbon during DDP period imposed higher risk of respiratory diseases. This study has provided carbonaceous fractions composition data as a tool to detect the aging processes of fireworks in ultra-fine, fine and coarse mode particles during the extreme firework days. Inhalation doses were calculated to establish potential influence on human health.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahilang, Mithlesh; Deb, Manas Kanti; Nirmalkar, Jayant; Pervez, Shamsh","journal":"Atmos Pollut Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99e596b047c0d66f25751941d1d80eb139a55ff4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172683.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1309104220300945; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220300945?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DDP"],"locations":["Raipur","India"],"keyphrases":["DDP period","fireworks days","Deepawali period","influence of fireworks","atmospheric aerosols","intense fine mode peak","fine mode intense peak","atmospheric aging of aerosols","aging processes of fireworks","high intense peak","size-distributed aerosols","Bimodal size-distribution","bimodal size distribution","Bimodal distribution","fireworks tracer metals","Deepawali festival","extreme firework days","Cu","biomass","study","coarse mode particles","carbonaceous species","Inhalation doses","potential influence","human health","Strong metal-metal correlations","observed high values of inhalation dose of elemental carbon","carbonaceous fractions composition data","higher risk of respiratory diseases","lower troposphere","mixed sources","Raipur","tool","effect","eastern central India","following pairs","Zn","emissions","heterogeneous reactions","similar firecrackers","events","BDP","ADP","Aerosol samples"],"language":"en"},

However, even early treatment might fail to prevent complications in some patients, particularly those infected with novel viruses such as the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, avian influenza A H5N1 virus subtype, or the avian influenza A H7N9 virus subtype. Furthermore, treatment with one antiviral drug might promote the development of antiviral resistance, especially in immunocompromised hosts and critically ill patients. An obvious strategy to optimise antiviral therapy is to combine drugs with different modes of action. Because host immune responses to infection might also contribute to illness pathogenesis, improved outcomes might be gained from the combination of antiviral therapy with drugs that modulate the immune response in an infected individual. We review available data from preclinical and clinical studies of combination antiviral therapy and of combined antiviral-immunomodulator therapy for influenza. Early-stage data draw attention to several promising antiviral combinations with therapeutic potential in severe infections, but there remains a need to substantiate clinical benefit.

Routine screening for common infections are an established part of the pretransplant evaluation of donors and recipients. Likewise, strategies exist for prophylaxis and surveillance for common donorassociated infections including hepatitis B, CMV and EBV. However, despite advances in diagnostic testing to evaluate the infectious risk of donors, unanticipated transmission of pathogens occurs, particularly when donors are asymptomatic or have subtle or unusual manifestations of a transmissible Infection. Infectious diseases (ID) providers play an integral role in donor and recipient risk assessment and can advise transplant centers on organ utilization and guide evaluation and management of the SOT recipient. Consideration of the donor cause of death and preceding clinical syndromes are important for characterizing the potential risk for recipient infection. This allows a more accurate analysis of the risk: benefit of accepting a life-saving organ and risk of infection. ID providers and transplant teams should work closely with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to solicit additional donor information when a donor-derived infection is suspected so that reporting can be facilitated to ensure communication with the care-teams of other organ recipients from the same donors.

The circulating species and their clinical impact were not described in Argentina. OBJECTIVES: To describe the molecular epidemiology of HRV in children and to determine the association of HRV species with outcome and severity. Study design: Hospitalized and outpatients children \u003C6 years old with ARI without comorbidities (n = 620) were enrolled (2008\u20132010). Demographic, clinical data and outcome were analyzed. HRV were identified by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis and demographic reconstruction for HRV were performed in selected samples. RESULTS: HRV were detected in 252/620 (40.6%) of children; 8.5% in viral coinfection. Bronchiolitis (55%) and pneumonia (13%) were the most frequent clinical diagnosis. Of 202 inpatients with HRV: 72% required oxygen supplementation, 11% intensive care unit and 3% mechanical ventilation. HRV were identified as a risk factor for hospitalization (OR: 2.47). All three HRV species were detected being HRV-A (55%) and HRV-C (43%) the most frequent; HRV-B was infrequent (2%). Of 44 sequenced HRV, 30 genotypes were detected. Seven of them were the most prevalent and circulated during limited periods of time. The demographic reconstruction revealed a constant population size and a high turnover rate of genotypes. Demographic and clinical outcome were similar for HRV-A and HRV-C infections. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the clinical impact of HRV in children without comorbidities as a cause of lower ARI and hospitalization. The high frequency of HRV infections may be associated with the simultaneous circulation of genotypes and their high turnover rate.","publish_time":"2014-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcone, D\u00E9bora Natalia; Culasso, Andr\u00E9s; Carballal, Guadalupe; Campos, Rodolfo; Echavarr\u00EDa, Marcela","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/921ff2d3db71f7a43641eec083a25d87517625eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185656.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321400376X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453332/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321400376X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","ARI"],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["HRV-B","sequenced HRV","clinical impact of HRV","HRV-C infections","association of HRV species","molecular epidemiology of HRV","high frequency of HRV infections","clinical outcome","demographic reconstruction","clinical data","frequent clinical diagnosis","outpatients children","high turnover rate of genotypes","cause of lower ARI","comorbidities","circulating species","hospitalization","lower acute respiratory infections","simultaneous circulation of genotypes","cause of upper","Study design","constant population size","intensive care unit","years old","oxygen supplementation","Phylogenetic analysis","mechanical ventilation","BACKGROUND","Human rhinoviruses","risk factor","severity","limited periods of time","selected samples","OBJECTIVES","viral coinfection","RT-PCR","CONCLUSION","Argentina","Bronchiolitis","pneumonia","RESULTS","inpatients"],"language":"en"},

Significant inflammation and lesions are often observed in lungs of infected cattle. During acute inflammatory responses, histones contribute to mortality in rodents and humans and serum proteins can protect against histone-induced cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that cattle experiencing chronic or fatal cases of BRDC have reduced ability to protect against cytotoxic effects of histones. Serum samples were collected from 66 bull calves at the time of normal feedlot processing procedures. Animals were retrospectively assigned to groups consisting of calves never treated for BRDC (control [CONT]; n = 10), calves treated with antimicrobials once for BRDC (1T; n = 16), calves treated twice for BRDC (2T; n = 13), calves treated 3 times for BRDC (3T; n = 14), or calves treated 4 times for BRDC (4T; n = 13). Samples were also collected each time animals received antimicrobial treatment; animals within a group were further sorted by calves that recovered and calves that died to test histone cytotoxicity. Bovine kidney cells were cultured in duplicate in 96-well plates and exposed to 0 or 50 \u03BCg/mL of total histones for 18 h with 1% serum from each animal. Cell viability was assessed by the addition of resazurin for 6 h followed by fluorescent quantification. Fluorescent values from serum alone were subtracted from values obtained for histone treatment for each animal. Serum from CONT, 1T, and 2T at initial processing all exhibited a similar (P \u003E 0.10) response to histone treatment with fluorescent values of \u2013312 \u00B1 557, \u20131,059 \u00B1 441, and \u2013975 \u00B1 489, respectively. However, 3T and 4T demonstrated an impaired capacity (P \u003C 0.05) to protect against histones (\u20132,778 \u00B1 471 and \u20133,026 \u00B1 489) at initial processing when compared to the other groups. When sorted by mortality within group, calves that were treated twice and recovered (\u2013847 \u00B1 331) demonstrated a greater (P \u003C 0.05) protective capacity than calves that were treated twice and died (\u20132,264 \u00B1 412), indicating that calves that contract BRDC and ultimately die might have reduced protective capacity against histone cytotoxicity. Results suggest that calves that require multiple treatments for BRDC have reduced ability to protect against cytotoxicity of histones. Understanding the primary mechanism responsible for protecting against histone cytotoxicity could lead to improved identification of animals susceptible to severe cases of BRDC, improved focus and use of available resources, or better treatments for severe cases of BRDC.","publish_time":"2015-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matera, J.

Beneficial gut microorganisms not only play a role in maintaining an intestinal barrier and metabolizing nutrients, but importantly, these microbes help regulate local and systemic immune function. Although FMT has been described for several centuries, only recently has it been utilized as a mainstream therapy in humans and significantly considered for applications in other species. In humans and animals, gastrointestinal diseases are by far the most widely accepted FMT-treatable conditions; however, recent research has shown exceptional promise for FMT being used to treat or prevent other conditions, including those outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, FMT is likely an underutilized, widely-available, and inexpensive tool for improving the health and response to disease in animals.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate demographical, clinical, and microbiological factors which could favor the presence of influenza viral RNA in the stools of patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza infection. METHODS: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) patients were enrolled by general practitioners (GP) during two winter seasons (2014\u20102016). Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens, and clinical data were collected. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory pathogen groups (nasopharyngeal and stool specimens) and for 12 enteric pathogens (stool specimens). RESULTS: Among the 331 patients with ARI enrolled by GP, 114 (34.4%) presented influenza infection. Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 21% (24/114) of the 114 stool specimens analyzed. Hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI)) [1.7\u201033.7], P = .02), age between 45 and 64 years (aOR = 4.8 [1.7\u201014.5], P = .01), consumption of raw shellfish and/or mollusks (aOR = 16.7 [3.6\u201090.9], P = .00), and use of antibiotics (aOR = 6.4 [2.1\u201019.8], P = .006) or antiviral treatment (aOR = 7.4 [1.9\u201029], P = .01) were significantly associated with an increased odds of the detection of influenza RNA in stools.

In Hong Kong (HK), nine new towns have been built in New Territories since 1970s, providing 172.6 km2 built-up land and large amount of residences for 3.4 million people. However, due to land scarcity, development restriction, and social opposition, New Development Area (NDA), as the small-scale extension of New Town (NT), was designated as one of the main approaches for HK medium and long term land supply. To demonstrate the characteristics of urban fringe land use transitions in Hong Kong, literature review and case study were used in this research. The history of new town development and the scheme of new development areas were introduced firstly. Afterwards, the land use features of NT and NDA were compared and the case of Hung Shui Kiu NDA was illustrated. It is concluded that while housing, infrastructure and facility were the main elements in NTs, employment, vibrancy and environment were suggested to be the new compulsory elements in NDAs integrated to the traditional planning concepts. As for the development approach, lease modification was adopted in NDA to allow private landowners directly develop their land, in addition to the traditional development approach of land resumption in NT. It is suggested to ensure the development of NDA, the proposed development plan should be persuasive to provide the optimal land use distribution as a trade-off among the profits of developers, the interests of local villager, government concern and the provision of land for future residents. Also, community engagement will play a more important role in NDA planning process. Referring to the analysis of urban fringe land use transitions and strategies for planning and development, the study would also be helpful to others growing cities.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, A.

An effective vaccination regime against RV can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virus-like particles formed by RV VP2 and VP6 (VLP2/6), as well as that of recombinant adenovirus expressing RV VP6 (rAd), in eliciting protective immunities against RV. However, the efficacy of such prime-boost strategy, which incorporates VLP and rAd in inducing protective immunities against RV, has not been addressed. We assessed the immune effects of different regimens in mice, including rAd prime-VLP2/6 boost (rAd\u002BVLP), VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost (VLP\u002BrAd), rAd alone, and VLP alone. RESULTS: Mice immunized with the VLP\u002BrAd regimen elicit stronger humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses than those immunized with other regimens. RV challenging experiments showed that the highest reduction (92.9%) in viral shedding was achieved in the VLP\u002BrAd group when compared with rAd\u002BVLP (25%), VLP alone (75%), or rAd alone (40%) treatment groups. The reduction in RV shedding in mice correlated with fecal IgG (r = 0.95773, P = 0.04227) and IgA (r = 0.96137, P = 0.038663). CONCLUSIONS: A VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost regimen is effective in conferring immunoprotection against RV challenge in mice. This finding may lay the groundwork for an alternative strategy in novel RV vaccine development.","publish_time":"2011-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Hongli; Guo, Li; Wang, Min; Qu, Jianguo; Zhao, Zhendong; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/820f3633db1b3b98889e6a0d257d10d385be85c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3024956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205330/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RV","VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rAd regimen","rAd prime-VLP2","rAd group","prime-rAd boost regimen","RV VP6","RV shedding","RV challenge","RV VP2","mice","RV challenging experiments","prime-boost strategy","novel RV vaccine development","eliciting protective immunities","alternative strategy","efficacy of virus","immune effects of different regimens","highest reduction","viral shedding","effective vaccination regime","cellular immune responses","conferring immunoprotection","particles","fecal IgG","main cause of severe gastroenteritis","children","groundwork","recombinant adenovirus","morbidity","Rotavirus","IgA","Previous studies","mortality","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","treatment groups","finding"],"language":"en"},

The dissection of complex protein dynamics is typically performed using relaxation rates determined at high and ultra-high field.

The field-cycling approach enables site-specific measurements of R (1) at low fields with the sensitivity and resolution of a high-field magnet. These data, together with high-field relaxation and heteronuclear NOE, provide evidence for correlated rigid-body motions of the entire \u03B2-hairpin, and corresponding motions of adjacent loops with a time constant of 0.8 ns (mesodynamics).

Summary The conventionnal tools used for virological diagnosis include direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IFA) or an immunoenzymatic test (EIA), and viral isolation technique (VIT). In most cases, IFA and EIA have a slightly lower sensitivity than VIT but are also able to detect some VIT-negative samples. Results of several teams using RT-PCR technologies show that the molecular methods detect more positive cases than the conventional tools. Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by multiplex RT-PCR and to determine wether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections. In conclusion, according to requirements of speed, low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of IFA and multiplex RT-PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Perrot, S.; Nimal, D.; Bach, N.; Outteryck, A.; Trippey, V.; Freymuth, F.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6744bc52b1b29d2ab28cbaeef8942eebece5175b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X07787067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X07787067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Les","Les r\u00E9sultats de"],"organizations":["EIA","IFA","VIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex RT-PCR","RT-PCR technologies","RT-PCR multiplex et d\u00E9couvrir","En conclusion","et l\u2019isolement en culture","RT-PCR multiplex semble ce jour","en cause dans","virus respiratoires","respiratory viruses","co\u00FBts et","l\u2019IF et","travail est en cours","d\u00E9tecter \u00E9galement une fraction d\u2019\u00E9chantillons faussement n\u00E9gatifs en culture","nouveaux virus","virus identifi\u00E9s","atteintes respiratoires","maladies respiratoires","discovered viruses","diagnosis of respiratory illnesses","number of viruses","l\u2019enfant","techniques d\u2019IF ou EIA ont une sensibilit\u00E9 en g\u00E9n\u00E9ral l\u00E9g\u00E8rement inf\u00E9rieure \u00E0 celle","d\u2019\u00E9chantillons positifs que","ou test immunoenzymatique","combined use of IFA","VIT-negative samples","burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections","progresser dans","montrent que","virological diagnosis","m\u00E9thodes traditionnelles","molecular methods","immunoenzymatic test","conventionnal tools","best way","positive cases","lower sensitivity","conventional tools","recherche antig\u00E9nique directe par immunofluorescence","diagnostic virologique comprennent","m\u00E9thodes mol\u00E9culaires d\u00E9tectent","direct antigen detection","highest rate of detection","meilleure fa\u00E7on","mais elles permettent","d\u00E9tection","tels","m\u00E9tapneumovirus humain","contr\u00F4le","\u00E9largir","fort taux","concilier rapidit\u00E9","nombre","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","l\u2019utilisation combin\u00E9e","utilisant","outils traditionnels","afin","plusieurs \u00E9quipes","requirements of speed","human metapneumovirus","viral isolation technique","low cost","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","teams","wether","r\u00E9sultats","Summary","children","Results","Work"],"language":"en"},

While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays. As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts. COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread. Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test; molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients. Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity. Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions. Key MessagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulia, Michael S; O\u0027Brien, Terrence P; Hou, Peter C; Schuman, Andrew; Sambursky, Robert","journal":"Annals of medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370561/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1763449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["IgG testing","widespread testing","testing capacity","multi-tiered testing strategy","care host immune response testing","molecular confirmatory testing","disease spread","national pandemic response","response time","diagnostic strategy","Coronavirus disease","Key MessagesDelayed testing deployment","rapid host immune response assay","existing strategy","proposed strategy","host immune point","point of care","risk of disease","Triaging patients","early mitigation strategy","overall disease burden","community spread","care tests","potential COVID","future pandemic planning","ongoing global pandemic","appropriate treatment of COVID","rapid IgM","public health containment","uncertainty","tiered diagnostic approach","Early screening","hampering containment efforts","quarantine","ability","triage","pathogen specific confirmatory tests","public health actions","screening test","critical component","assay accuracy","urgent need","significant infections","delaying treatment","bacterial infections","current outbreak","healthcare system preparation efforts","deployment of organism identification assays","novel enveloped single stranded RNA coronavirus","development","herd immunity","experienced delays","viral isolation","invasive swab","therapeutic decisions","SARS-CoV","hours","information","days","fingerstick","guidance of medical","emergencies","reliance","population exposure","months","minutes","benefit","hospitals","outset","weeks","progression","countries","sufficient quantities"],"language":"en"},

However, summaries on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to induce the coronavirus disease 2019 are rare at present. This review aims to summarize data on the persistence of different coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces. The literature was systematically searched on Medline without language restrictions. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration persistence of coronaviruses on any type of surface were included. Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses, influenza, SARS-CoV, or rhinovirus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Persistence time on inanimate surfaces varied from minutes to up to one month, depending on the environmental conditions. SARS-CoV-2 can be sustained in air in closed unventilated buses for at least 30 min without losing infectivity. The most common coronaviruses may well survive or persist on surfaces for up to one month. Viruses in respiratory or fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish a positive-control protocol for an effective brain safety test to enhance rapid vaccine development.

In this study, test conditions are established so that the degree of brain penetration or brain destruction of newly developed vaccines can be quantitatively identified. The most effective conditions were suggested by measuring time-dependent expressions of tight junction biomarkers (zonula occludens-1 [ZO-1] and occludin) in two types of mice (C57BL/6 and ICR) following exposure to two types of LPS (Salmonella and Escherichia).

To safeguard this process in the face of environmental threats and internal stressors, cells mount an evolutionarily conserved response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Invading pathogens induce cellular stress that impacts protein folding, thus the UPR is well situated to sense danger and contribute to immune responses. Cytokines (inflammatory cytokines and interferons) critically mediate host defense against pathogens, but when aberrantly produced, may also drive pathologic inflammation. The UPR influences cytokine production on multiple levels, from stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, to modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, and the regulation of cytokine transcription factors. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying cytokine regulation by the UPR, and the repercussions of this relationship for infection and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. Interrogation of viral and bacterial infections has revealed increasing numbers of examples where pathogens induce or modulate the UPR and implicated UPR-modulated cytokines in host response. The flip side of this coin, the UPR/ER stress responses have been increasingly recognized in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Examples include monogenic disorders of ER function, diseases linked to misfolding protein (HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis), diseases directly implicating UPR and autophagy genes (inflammatory bowel disease), and autoimmune diseases targeting highly secretory cells (e.g., diabetes). Given the burgeoning interest in pharmacologically targeting the UPR, greater discernment is needed regarding how the UPR regulates cytokine production during specific infections and autoimmune processes, and the relative place of this interaction in pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Judith A.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cbc073d7288259db8f24cd19ee27052c1eece02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5844972.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","UPR/ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoimmune diseases","UPR influences cytokine production","implicated UPR-modulated cytokines","inflammatory cytokines","autoinflammatory diseases","cytokine regulation","pathogens","unfolded protein response","autoimmune processes","misfolding protein","modulation of inflammatory","variety of autoimmune","host response","ER stress responses","impacts protein folding","inflammatory bowel disease","conserved response","regulation of cytokine transcription factors","monogenic disorders of ER function","specific infections","bacterial infections","secretory cells","cellular stress","immune responses","mediate host defense","increasing numbers of examples","essential cell function","multiple levels","interferons","stimulation of pattern recognition receptors","autophagy genes","face of environmental threats","internal stressors","relative place","HLA-B27","spondyloarthritis","relationship","sense danger","pathways","coin","mechanisms","Interrogation of viral","endoplasmic reticulum","interaction","pathogenesis","repercussions","greater discernment","diabetes","pathologic inflammation","flip","review"],"language":"en"},

Even if non-transplant critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) have serious CA-RVI, comparison between these groups remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and mortality of CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. METHODS: We collected 37,777 CA-RVs multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals aged \u226518 years from November 2012 to November 2017. The CA-RVs tests included adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. RESULTS: We found 286 CA-RVI cases, including 85 solid organ transplantation recipients (G1), 61 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (G2), and 140 non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (G3), excluding those with repeated isolation within 30 days. Adenovirus positive rate and infection cases were most prominent in G2 (p \u003C 0.001). The median time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was 30 and 20 months in G1 and G2, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 or G2 (51.4% vs. 28.2% or 39.3%, p = 0.002, respectively). The mechanical ventilation (MV) was the independent risk factor associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality in all three groups (hazard ratio, 3.37, 95% confidence interval, 2.04\u20135.56, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of CA-RVs diagnosis in transplant recipients even in long-term posttransplant period, and in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU with MV.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Kyoung Hwa; Yoo, Seul Gi; Cho, Yonggeun; Kwon, Da Eun; La, Yeonju; Han, Sang Hoon; Kim, Myoung Soo; Choi, Jin Sub; Kim, Soon Il; Kim, Yu Seun; Min, Yoo Hong; Cheong, June-Won; Kim, Jin Seok; Song, Yong Goo","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2936ff9a150d9141065466a8aafd46aace8d739d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0ada158e5af242ffafe0c15d5af9d3c5f141e709.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102620.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2019.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262511/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118218302330; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118218302330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","G1","MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Transplant recipients","mortality of CA","non-transplant","CA-RVI cases","importance of CA","serious CA-RVI","CA-RVs tests","ill patients","ICU","G2","G1","solid organ transplantation recipients","RVs diagnosis","hospital mortality","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients","infection cases","All-cause","G3","MV","groups","respiratory syncytial virus","human bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","respiratory viruses","parainfluenza virus","confidence interval","Adenovirus positive rate","median time interval","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals","OC43","intensive care unit","life-threatening community","NL63","coronavirus","long-term posttransplant period","seasonal influenza","independent risk factor","rhinovirus","comparison","hazard ratio","PURPOSE","clinical characteristics","study","BACKGROUND","months","repeated isolation","mechanical ventilation","days","CONCLUSIONS","years","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Antibody detection is reported in relation to immune disorder diagnostics. Subsequently, nucleic acid targets are considered for revealing genetic diseases (e.g., point mutation and single nucleotides polymorphism, SNPs) as well as new emerging clinical markers (microRNA) and for pathogen detection.

However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays. The results show that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus support viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ACE2. Further, the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency, as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ACE2 molecules. These data suggest that M. daubentoni and R. sinicus are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV and may be candidates as the natural host of the SARS-CoV progenitor viruses. Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses. This calls for continuation and expansion of field surveillance studies among different bat populations to eventually identify the true natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.

R 0 provides a threshold for elimination and determines when a disease can spread or when a disease will die out. Classically, R 0 is calculated assuming an infinite population of identical hosts. Previous work has shown that heterogeneity in the host mixing rate increases R 0 in an infinite population. However, it has been suggested that in a finite population, heterogeneity in the mixing rate may actually decrease the finite-population reproductive numbers. Here, we outline a framework for discussing different types of heterogeneity in disease parameters, and how these affect disease spread and control. We calculate \u201Cfinite-population reproductive numbers\u201D with different types of heterogeneity, and show that in a finite population, heterogeneity has complicated effects on the reproductive number. We find that simple heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive number, whereas heterogeneity in the intrinsic mixing rate (which affects both infectiousness and susceptibility) increases the finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is small relative to the size of the population and decreases the finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population. Although heterogeneity has complicated effects on the finite-population reproductive numbers, its implications for control are straightforward: when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population, heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive numbers, making disease control or elimination easier than predicted by R 0 .","publish_time":"2016-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keegan, Lindsay T.; Dushoff, Jonathan","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f499390688341ddde3b37c63966ef576abb0df8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094132.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316000552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891919/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519316000552; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["finite-population reproductive numbers","basic reproductive number","simple heterogeneity","infinite population of identical hosts","different types of heterogeneity","disease control","disease parameters","affect disease","size","intrinsic mixing rate","host mixing rate","complicated effects","elimination easier","implications","infectiousness","framework","susceptibility","important epidemiological quantities","Previous work","threshold"],"language":"en"},

PEDV non-structural accessory protein ORF3 is an ion channel related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Our previous study showed that PEDV ORF3 has expression characteristic of aggregation in cytoplasm, but its biological function remains elusive. Thus in this study, we initiated the construction of various vectors to express ORF3, and found ORF3 localized in the cytoplasm in the aggregation manner. Subsequently, confocal microscopy analysis showed that the aggregated ORF3 localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to trigger ER stress response via up-regulation of GRP78 protein expression and activation of PERK-eIF2\u03B1 signaling pathway. In addition, our results showed that PEDV ORF3 could induce the autophagy through inducing conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, but couldn\u2019t influence the apoptosis. In contrast, conversion of LC3-I/LC3-II could be significantly inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, indicating that ORF3-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response. This work not only provides some new findings for the biological function of the PEDV ORF3 protein, but also help us for the further understanding the molecular interaction between PEDV ORF3 protein and cells.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Dehua; Xu, Jiaxin; Duan, Xulai; Xu, Xin; Li, Pengfei; Cheng, Lixin; Zheng, Liang; Li, Xingzhi; Zhang, Yating; Wang, Xianhe; Wu, Xuening; Shen, Yujiang; Yao, Xiangyu; Wei, Jiaqi; Yao, Lili; Li, Liyang; Song, Baifen; Ma, Jinzhu; Liu, Xinyang; Wu, Zhijun; Zhang, Hua; Cao, Hongwei","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f6a1f1e663c8206b81c17f30327e4c31e462f3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117398.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519305280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383304/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519305280; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.07.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV ORF3 protein","aggregated ORF3","express ORF3","PEDV non-structural accessory protein ORF3","ORF3-induced autophagy","ER stress response","ER stress inhibitor","inducing conversion of LC3","regulation of GRP78 protein expression","biological function","cytoplasm","expression characteristic of aggregation","aggregation manner","previous study","positive-stranded RNA virus","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","genus Alphacoronavirus","ion channel","activation of PERK","family Coronaviridae","order Nidovirales","endoplasmic reticulum","construction of various vectors","molecular interaction","viral infectivity","eIF2\u03B1","causative agent of PED","new findings","cells","confocal microscopy analysis","pathogenicity","pathway","PBA","results","work","addition","contrast","apoptosis"],"language":"en"},

By pulse-chase labeling experiments in the presence of drugs which inhibit N-linked oligosaccharide addition and processing we demonstrate that addition of high mannose precursor oligosaccharides is necessary for transport and cleavage of the viral GP-C glycoprotein. Moreover, in the presence of tunicamycin which inhibits en bloc addition of these mannose-rich side chains, virus budding was substantially decreased and infectious virions were reduced by more than 1000-fold in the supernatant medium. Incubation in the presence of castantospermine, which permits addition of oligomannosyl-rich chains but blocks further processing, restored transport and cleavage of GP-C and maturation of virions. Finally, by temperature block experiments we have determined that maturation of GP-C oligosaccharides to an endoglycosidase H resistant form precedes cleavage to GP-1 and GP-2.

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.","publish_time":"1988-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Moore, Steven","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4e399086421d7a4ee583df68104d16113c12412.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268228890503X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268228890503X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","viral spread","viral replicates","specific RNA","white matter tracts","uninfected mice","antisense RNA probe","brainstem","group","subcortical white matter","well-defined tracts","demyelinating encephalomyelitis","MHV-JHM spreads","localization of virus","fatal acute encephalomyelitis","Abstract Suckling C57BU6 mice","cerebral grey matter","late onset demyelinating disease","film autoradiography","infected organs","distribution","mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM","macroscopic movements of virus","well-defined neuronal pathways","clinical disease","serial sections of brains","close physical proximity","central nervous system","basal ganglia","extracellular route","hippocampus","mesencephalon","hypothalamus","limited number of areas","optic chiasm","situ hybridization","parts","spinal cords","technique","contiguous structures","results","different patterns","immunized dams"],"language":"en"},

Pigs can be infected by both avian and mammalian influenza viruses and are sources of generation of reassortant influenza viruses capable of causing pandemics in humans. Current commercial vaccines provide satisfactory immunity against homologous viruses; however, protection against heterologous viruses is not adequate. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of an intranasal Poly I:C adjuvanted UV inactivated bivalent swine influenza vaccine consisting of Swine/OH/24366/07 H1N1 and Swine/CO/99 H3N2, referred as PAV, in maternal antibody positive pigs against an antigenic variant and a heterologous swine influenza virus challenge. Groups of three-week-old commercial-grade pigs were immunized intranasally with PAV or a commercial vaccine (CV) twice at 2 weeks intervals. Three weeks after the second immunization, pigs were challenged with the antigenic variant Swine/MN/08 H1N1 (MN08) and the heterologous Swine/NC/10 H1N2 (NC10) influenza virus. Antibodies in serum and respiratory tract, lung lesions, virus shedding in nasal secretions and virus load in lungs were assessed. Intranasal administration of PAV induced challenge viruses specific-hemagglutination inhibition- and IgG antibodies in the serum and IgA and IgG antibodies in the respiratory tract. Importantly, intranasal administration of PAV provided protection against the antigenic variant MN08 and the heterologous NC10 swine influenza viruses as evidenced by significant reductions in lung virus load, gross lung lesions and significantly reduced shedding of challenge viruses in nasal secretions. These results indicate that Poly I:C or its homologues may be effective as vaccine adjuvants capable of generating cross-protective immunity against antigenic variants/heterologous swine influenza viruses in pigs.","publish_time":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Milton; Wang, Zhao; Sreenivasan, Chithra C.; Hause, Ben M.; Gourapura J.

At the day of TGEV-challenge, the in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of group 3 pigs with inactivated TGEV resulted in an increase in double positive (CD4\u002BCD8\u002B), natural killer (CD2\u002BCD4\u2212CD8\u002Bdim) and cytotoxic (CD2\u002BCD4\u2212CD8\u002Bbright) T-cell phenotypes, accompanied by increased expression of interleukin-2 receptor and a decrease of the null (CD2\u2212CD4\u2212CD8\u2212/SW6\u002B) cell phenotype.","publish_time":"1999-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sestak, K.; Meister, R.K.; Hayes, J.R.; Kim, L.; Lewis, P.A.; Myers, G.; Saif, L.J.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc4689e9a0f8c2d5711673eda0dc66be1a820fe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119614.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242799000744; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242799000744","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia"],"organizations":["TGEV","IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV proteins","TGEV-challenge","inactivated TGEV","TGEV-antigens","day of TGEV","TGEV-seronegative pigs","TGEV-recombinant proteins","TGEV-specific mucosal","dose of TGEV S-protein","virulent TGEV Miller-strain","challenge of pigs","CD8","inoculated pigs","CD4","mesenteric lymph nodes of group","CD2","intraperitoneal inoculation of pigs","stimulation of mononuclear cells","mesenteric lymph node immune responses","LT-R192G","IFA","structural proteins","T-cell phenotypes","baculovirus","recombinant protein vaccine","systemic immune responses","Induction of active immunity","major T-cell subset distribution","virus-neutralizing","IgA-antibodies","commercial vaccine","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","thermolabile Escherichia coli mutant toxin","conjunction","gut","partial protection","receptor","null","dim","natural killer","increased expression of interleukin","incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant","high titers of serum IgG","decrease","lymphoid tissues","sham","efficacy","SW6","suckling","comparison","attempt","days of age","GALT","week-old","groups"],"language":"en"},

ELISA results were evaluated both with \u201Csuspect\u201D results interpreted as positive and then as negative. All commercial kits showed excellent diagnostic specificity (99 to 100%) when testing samples from pigs inoculated with virus-free culture medium. However, analyses revealed differences between the kits in diagnostic sensitivity (percent TGEV- or PRCV-seropositive pigs), and all kits showed significant (P \u003C 0.05) cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV serum antibodies, particularly during early stages of the infections. Serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV seemed to be TGEV strain dependent, with a higher percentage of PRCV-false-positive results for pigs inoculated with TGEV Purdue than for TGEV Miller. Moreover, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive, regardless of the ELISA kit evaluated. IMPORTANCE Current measures to prevent TGEV from entering a naive herd include quarantine and testing for TGEV-seronegative animals. However, TGEV serology is complicated due to the cross-reactivity with PRCV, which circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. Conventional serological tests cannot distinguish between TGEV and PRCV antibodies; however, blocking ELISAs using antigen containing a large deletion in the amino terminus of the PRCV S protein permit differentiation of PRCV and TGEV antibodies. Several commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs are available, but performance comparisons have not been reported in recent research. This study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV affects the accuracy of commercial blocking ELISAs. Individual test results must be interpreted with caution, particularly in the event of suspect results. Therefore, commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs should only be applied on a herd basis.","publish_time":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magtoto, Ronaldo; Poonsuk, Korakrit; Baum, David; Zhang, Jianqiang; Chen, Qi; Ji, Ju; Pi\u00F1eyro, Pablo; Zimmerman, Jeffrey; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis G.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ac9aac4ecdf40363f1377cc08484db3dc4abf93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6416363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00017-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Miller"],"organizations":["TGEV","PRCV","TGEV Purdue","PRCV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["commercial TGEV","TGEV antibodies","TGEV Purdue","TGEV Miller","percent TGEV","TGEV serology","PRCV antibodies","TGEV strain Purdue","TGEV strain Miller","TGEV strain dependent","TGEV-seronegative animals","PRCV-seropositive pigs","PRCV serum antibodies","higher percentage of PRCV","PRCV S protein permit differentiation of PRCV","commercial kits","accuracy of commercial blocking ELISAs","ELISA results","false-positive results","Serologic cross-reactivity","event of suspect results","Individual test results","commercial transmissible gastroenteritis virus","virus-free culture medium","serum samples","testing","study","diagnostic sensitivity","naive herd","herd basis","ELISA kit","excellent diagnostic specificity","overall proportion of false positives","porcine respiratory coronavirus","amino terminus","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","large deletion","performances","quarantine","early stages","differences","day observation period","performance comparisons","Conventional serological tests","antigen","caution","IMPORTANCE Current measures","infections","analyses","recent research","swine herds"],"language":"en"},

International Journal for Parasitology 24: 255\u2013258. Sera from 60 horses held in breeding herd in Brazil were examined monthly by ELISA, immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blot. All foals had maternal antibodies detectable by ELISA and IFAT, and seroconversion took place between the 2nd and 5th month of age. The 48 and 50 kDa antigens were recognized first in the course of infection.

There was limited differentiation among regions, evidence that this is a generally panmictic population. Measures of genetic variation were similar among all regions and were comparable with Eastern African cheetah populations. Parentage analyses confirmed several observations based on field studies, including 21 of 23 previously hypothesized family groups, 40 probable parent/offspring pairs, and 8 sibling groups. These results also verified the successful integration and reproduction of several cheetahs following natural dispersal or translocation. Animals within social groups (family groups, male coalitions, or sibling groups) were generally related. Within the main study area, radio-collared female cheetahs were more closely interrelated than similarly compared males, a pattern consistent with greater male dispersal.

It was found that the recognition between the enzyme and its substrates involved many positions in the substrate, at least including residues from P4 to P2\u2032. The deletion of either P4 or P2\u2032 residue in the substrate would decrease its cleavage efficiency dramatically. In contrast to the previous suggestion that only small residues in substrate could be accommodated to the S1\u2032 subsite, we have found that bulky residues such as Tyr and Trp were also acceptable. In addition, based on both peptide-based assay and autocleavage assay, Ile at the P1\u2032 position could not be hydrolyzed, but the mutant L27A could hydrolyze the Ile peptide fragment. It suggested that there was a stereo hindrance between the S1\u2032 subsite and the side chain of Ile in the substrate.

We sought to determine whether infections with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 are associated with pneumonia and to define the epidemiology of HCoV infection in rural Thailand. Methods. We developed a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay panel for the recognized HCoV types and compared HCoV infections in patients hospitalized with pneumonia, outpatients with influenza-like illness, and asymptomatic control patients between September 2003 and August 2005. Results. During study year 1, 43 (5.9%) of 734 patients with pneumonia had HCoV infections; 72.1% of the infections were with OC43. During study year 2, when control patients were available, 21 (1.8%) of 1156 patients with pneumonia, 12 (2.3%) of 513 outpatients, and 6 (2.1%) of 281 control patients had HCoV infections. Compared with infection in control patients, infection with any HCoV type or with all types combined was not associated with pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio for all HCoV types, 0.67 [95% confidence interval, 0.26\u20131.75]; P= .40 ). HCoV infections were detected throughout both study years; 93.6% of OC43 infections in the first year occurred from January through March. Conclusions. HCoV infections were infrequently detected in rural Thailand by use of sensitive real-time RTPCR assays. We found no association between HCoV infection and illness.

Although Mediterranean fruit fly adult and third-instar larvae can usually be identified and distinguished from other species by morphological keys, it is often difficult or impossible to identify or distinguish this species from other tephritids by using material from other stages of development. In such situations, use of a molecular technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) would be valuable as a rapid and robust alternative species diagnostic tool. This method uses isothermal conditions and requires only relatively inexpensive equipment. In this study we have developed a simple and rapid procedure that combines a Chelex-based DNA extraction procedure with LAMP to rapidly detect the presence of Mediterranean fruit fly DNA and discriminate it from other species, by using material from different stages of development.

To address the possibility that the RNA cleavage represents a regulatory mechanism for maintaining persistent infection, the interactions between Leishmania cytoplasmic proteins and in vitro synthesized viral transcripts were studied. In gel mobility shift experiments, three specific RNA/protein complexes were formed between cellular proteins and the cleaved viral transcript, and three major proteins were labeled by UV cross-linking. No protein binding activity was observed for either the short (320 nt) or full-length RNA transcripts. However, the two cleavage reaction products were able to form stable RNA/RNA complexes.

Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a system that not only identifies high binding T-cell antigenic epitopes, but also class I T-cell antigenic clusters termed immunological hot spots. Methods: MULTIPRED, a computational system for promiscuous prediction of HLA class I binders, uses artificial neural networks (ANN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) as predictive engines. The models were rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally identified HLA class I T-cell epitopes from human melanoma related proteins and human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7. We have developed a scoring scheme for identification of immunological hot spots for HLA class I molecules, which is the sum of the highest four predictions within a window of 30 amino acids. Results: Our predictions against experimental data from four melanoma-related proteins showed that MULTIPRED ANN and HMM models could predict T-cell epitopes with high accuracy. The analysis of proteins E6 and E7 showed that ANN models appear to be more accurate for prediction of HLA-A3 hot spots and HMM models for HLA-A2 predictions. For illustration of its utility we applied MULTIPRED for prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes in all four SARS coronavirus structural proteins.

We evaluated a novel, efficient polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition assay and examined correlations with reductions in infectivity. Methods. Contaminated plasma was treated with 150 \u03BCmol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A light and then tested for DNA modification using conventional PCR inhibition and a novel preamplification approach. The novel assay subjected the samples to preamplification cycles using long\u2010template PCR, followed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) inhibition detection. Both approaches were tested for correlations with reductions in viral infectivity by comparing ELISpot assay results of identical samples. Results. The B19 preamplification inhibition assay showed detection ranges of 2\u20132.5 log and demonstrated quantitative correlation with up to a 5.8\u2010log reduction in viral infectivity in ELISpot results.

The epicenter of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19. As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health. This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients. It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic. Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassan, Syed Adeel; Sheikh, Fahad N; Jamal, Somia; Ezeh, Jude K; Akhtar, Ali","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d9d79fd824d74dc2fd482f8db2b8d1cf8a5a4e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170025.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","form of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus","general overview of coronavirus","cluster of patients","counseling of patients","treatment of COVID","rapid pandemic of COVID","review","humans","clinical features","current pandemic","recent outbreak","up-to-date clinical information","enveloped RNA virus","seafood","secondary healthcare providers","effective management","endemic outbreaks","exotic animal wholesale markets","awareness","prevention","pneumonia of unknown etiology","viruses","threat","city","evaluation","new strain","public health","past","decades","Wuhan","China","hepatic systems","epicenter of infection","species","means","disease","number of cases","total","wildlife","emergence"],"language":"en"},

Social contact networks, which describe the contact relationships among individuals, always exhibit overlapping qualities of communities, hierarchical structure and spatial-correlated. We find that traditional global targeted immunization strategy would lose its superiority in controlling the epidemic propagation in the social contact networks with modular and hierarchical structure. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical targeted immunization strategy to settle this problem. In this novel strategy, importance of the hierarchical structure is considered. Transmission control experiments of influenza H1N1 are carried out based on a modular and hierarchical network model. Results obtained indicate that hierarchical structure of the network is more critical than the degrees of the immunized targets and the modular network layer is the most important for the epidemic propagation control. Finally, the efficacy and stability of this novel immunization strategy have been validated as well.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Zhichao; Ge, Yuanzheng; Luo, Lei; Duan, Hong; Qiu, Xiaogang","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/547b2d49997e2fb0095b675cf6882351449dba62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126276.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437115006445; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115006445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288094/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.07.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hierarchical structure","hierarchical targeted immunization strategy","hierarchical network model","Social contact networks","novel immunization strategy","novel strategy","Abstract Social contact","contact relationships","modular network layer","epidemic propagation control","traditional global targeted immunization strategy","individuals","airborne epidemic transmission","Transmission control experiments of influenza H1N1","chief factor","immunized targets","overlapping qualities of communities","superiority","degrees","stability","importance","efficacy","crowd","problem","Results"],"language":"en"},

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 cases (33.0%) were severe and two patients (2.2%) died. The severe disease group tended to be older (50.5 vs. 42.0 years; p = 0.049) and have more chronic disease (40% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.009) relative to mild disease group. Only 73.6% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomography images were obtained for each patient. The most common complaints were cough (n = 75; 82.4%), fever (n = 59; 64.8%), fatigue (n = 35; 38.5%), and diarrhea (n = 14; 15.4%). Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests. Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan. Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems. Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xin-Ying; Xu, Xuan-Xuan; Yin, Hai-Sen; Hu, Qin-Ming; Xiong, Tao; Tang, Yuan-Yan; Yang, Ai-Ying; Yu, Bao-Ping; Huang, Zhi-Ping","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08b8071e86c9e39314fad083588214ce40b33ee7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188494.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05010-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345226/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Jingzhou Central Hospital"],"keyphrases":["mild patients","ill patients","accuracy of COVID","clinical characteristics of COVID","mortality rate of patients","cases","Non-respiratory injury","mild disease group","severe disease group","coronavirus disease","chronic disease","respiratory problems","typical chest computed tomography images","non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province","laboratory tests","Jingzhou Central Hospital","qPCR analysis of throat swab samples","digestive tract","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","heart injuries","elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase","treatment progress","people","kidney","China","liver","common complaints","cough","date","worldwide outbreak","tens of thousands","CONCLUSIONS","years","diagnosis","creatine kinase","METHODS","fever","fatigue","diarrhea","creatinine","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The Mediterranean diet is mentioned to be rich in fruits and vegetables, monounsaturated fatty acids and olive oil and the diet has a negative association with incidence of metabolic syndrome that contributes to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Mediterranean plants are believed to prevent or cure a wide range of ailments based on their bioactive components that can exert anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic or anti-diabetic activities. A table is presented that gives a list of Mediterranean plants and their health benefits as well as brief accounts of the medicinal use of the plants and includes rosemary, licorice, chamomile and olive oil among others. The consumption of olive oil has a strong correlation with reduced hypertension, cancers of the prostate, breast and colon.

Gene amplification, a common adaptive mechanism in prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes, has also contributed to viral evolution, especially of large DNA viruses. In experimental systems, gene amplification is one mechanism for rapidly overcoming selective pressures. Because the amplification generally incurs a fitness cost, emergence of adaptive point mutations within the amplified locus or elsewhere in the genome can enable collapse of the locus back to a single copy. Evidence of gene amplification followed by subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the copies is apparent by the presence of families of paralogous genes in many DNA viruses. These observations suggest that copy number variation has contributed broadly to virus evolution.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayer, Avraham; Brennan, Greg; Geballe, Adam P","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25bcbdad676f3b5ba735b5baab8efe5776958007.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6289852.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2018.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015083/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625718300282; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625718300282","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Evidence of gene amplification","large DNA viruses","common adaptive mechanism","amplified locus","viral evolution","virus evolution","single copy","copy number variation","emergence of adaptive point mutations","fitness cost","presence of families","prokaryotes","archaea","paralogous genes","subfunctionalization","neofunctionalization","host defenses","copies","genome","experimental systems","new niches","eukaryotes","observations","response","selective pressures","collapse"],"language":"en"},

However, new control strategies are still needed since FMDV outbreaks still occur in some disease\u2010free countries. Currently, interferon (IFN)\u2010based strategies have been demonstrated to be an efficient biotherapeutic option against FMDV; however, interferon omega (IFN\u2010\u03C9) has not yet been assessed in this capacity. Thus, this study evaluated the antiviral activity of porcine IFN omega 7 (PoIFN\u2010\u03C97) against FMDV. After the PoIFN\u2010\u03C97 was expressed and purified, cell proliferation assays and quantitative real\u2010time reverse transciption\u2010polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate the effective anti\u2010cytopathic concentration of PoIFN\u2010\u03C97 and its effectiveness pre\u2010 and post\u2010infection with FMDV in swine kidney cells (IBRS\u20102). Results showed the rHis\u2010PoIFN\u2010\u03C97 fusion protein was considerably expressed using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain, and the recombinant protein exhibited significant in vitro protection against FMDV, including two strains belonging to type O and A FMDV, respectively. In addition, PoIFN\u2010\u03C97 upregulated the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, OAS1, and PKR genes. These findings indicated that IFN\u2010\u03C9 has the potential for serving as a useful therapeutic agent to prevent FMDV or other viral outbreaks in pigs.","publish_time":"2018-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shi\u2010Fang; Zhao, Fu\u2010Rong; Gong, Mei\u2010Jiao; Shao, Jun\u2010Jun; Xie, Yin\u2010Li; Chang, Hui\u2010Yun; Zhang, Yong\u2010Guang","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0a5f9574edcebef31eff455a8c87da227800556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039874/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FMDV outbreaks","\u03C97 fusion protein","interferon omega","viral outbreaks","effective anti\u2010cytopathic concentration of PoIFN","antiviral activity of porcine IFN omega","recombinant protein","mouth disease","based strategies","new control strategies","quantitative real\u2010time reverse transciption","post\u2010infection","polymerase chain reaction","cell proliferation assays","effectiveness pre\u2010","swine kidney cells","ISG15","OAS1","DE3","Escherichia coli BL21","protection","rHis","transcription of Mx1","important role","vaccines","strains","useful therapeutic agent","IBRS","potential","economic importance","efficient biotherapeutic option","PKR genes","study","type O","pigs","disease\u2010free countries","Foot","Results","findings","addition","capacity"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluates uses a survey of 2168 individuals across the U.S. Ordered logit regressions are used to model risk perception and generalized ordered logit regressions are used to model risk mitigation travel-related decisions. Models are estimated for three influenza outbreak scenarios, specifically an individual\u0027s travel-related: 1) risk perceptions, 2) risk mitigation decisions when infected and the individual wants to prevent spreading it, and may want treatment, and 3) risk mitigation decisions when not infected and the individual wants to reduce exposure. Risk perception results show that a recent personal experience with influenza-like symptoms and being female significantly increased risk perception at mandatory and medical trip locations. Risk mitigation model results show that males are less likely to alter their travel patterns in response to the possible spreading of the virus or increasing exposure. Knowing the difference between influenza and the stomach flu is more influential in reducing travel than a recent influenza experience in one\u0027s household. Individuals proactive with their health (i.e., receive the vaccine, have health insurance) are also proactive in seeking medical attention and reducing influenza spread. Lastly, aligned with the Protection Motivation Theory, individuals reduce travel to locations in which they perceived medium or high risk. However, increased risk perceived at one\u0027s work location did not significantly reduce travel. The findings provide insight into the risk perception and mitigation behavior of the American public during the COVID-19 pandemic and after restrictions are lifted.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hotle, Susan; Murray-Tuite, Pamela; Singh, Kunal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e35e6af9ad77b78dea460a9c97bef7ae688a913e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220300385; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220300385","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["risk mitigation decisions","risk perceptions","high risk","Risk perception results","increased risk perception","risk mitigation travel-related decisions","Risk mitigation model results","travel patterns","Abstract Influenza","influenza spread","recent influenza experience","mitigation behavior","individual\u0027s travel-related","influenza outbreak scenarios","Individuals proactive","ordered logit regressions","health insurance","exposure","recent personal experience","medical trip locations","medical attention","contagious virus","possible spreading","symptoms","American public","males","stomach flu","Protection Motivation Theory","COVID","response","work location","insight","pandemic","difference","vaccine","household","findings","economic productivity","restrictions","survey","Models","treatment","study"],"language":"en"},

Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive. Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2. Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice. So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time. Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination. This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Ruoshi; Cui, Bomiao; Duan, Xiaobo; Zhang, Ping; Zhou, Xuedong; Yuan, Quan","journal":"Int J Oral Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4df0d07fa844db504fc166858a64387ec08d4ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32300101/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-020-0080-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV dissemination","acquisition of saliva droplets","nCoV epidemic control","formation of infectious saliva droplets","short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets","long-distance saliva aerosol transmission","diagnostic value of saliva","nCoV nucleic acid positive","close contact transmission","indoor air","salivary glands","oral tissues","indoor space","air flow","oral cavity","direct invasion","direct evidence","environment dependent","procedures","primary mode","long time","tongue","lungs","review","hosts","biofluid","dental practice","global outbreak of COVID","expression of ACE2"],"language":"en"},

We developed and optimized a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) multiplex PCR assay for detecting influenza viruses including seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, influenza B and H5N1. METHODS: The optimized multiplex DPO PCR was used to detect 233 clinical human samples. The results were compared to those obtained with RT-qPCR, conventional PCR and immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: Specificity analysis revealed that the DPO PCR assay amplified each target virus without any cross-amplification. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the multiplex DPO-PCR sensitivity was higher than for the immunochromatographic assay and lower than for qPCR, while no significant difference was observed compared with conventional PCR, when detecting influenza A and B. Additional experiments using the same sample panel indicated no significant differences between the number of positive samples detected by multiplex DPO PCR and RT-qPCR when applying a Cq with a value lower than 30. CONCLUSIONS: The five-targeted simultaneous multiplex DPO PCR assay could be easily adopted into routine practice. This approach is cost effective with a short running time, low technical requirements for the detection of influenza virus and early diagnosis in clinical laboratories.","publish_time":"2015-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Xuezheng; Xu, Huanzhou; Shi, Lei; Yang, Pengfei; Zhang, Liping; Sun, Xiaohong; Zhen, Wei; Hu, Kongxin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b305688d964809c3cd62063d7fa6ecf30ebbc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4344991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25886516/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0818-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPO PCR","B.

The intracellular proteins cathepsin B and L, two-pore channel 1 and 2, and bona fide receptor Niemann\u2013Pick Disease C1 (NPC1) are essential for the endosomal phase of cell entry. However, earlier steps of filoviral infection remain poorly characterized. Numerous plasma membrane proteins have been implicated in attachment but it is still unclear which ones are sufficient for productive entry. To define a minimal set of host factors required for filoviral glycoprotein-driven cell entry, we screened twelve cell lines and identified the nonlymphocytic cell line SH-SY5Y to be specifically resistant to filovirus infection. Heterokaryons of SH-SY5Y cells fused to susceptible cells were susceptible to filoviruses, indicating that SH-SY5Y cells do not express a restriction factor but lack an enabling factor critical for filovirus entry. However, all tested cell lines expressed functional intracellular factors. Global gene expression profiling of known cell surface entry factors and protein expression levels of analyzed attachment factors did not reveal any correlation between susceptibility and expression of a specific host factor. Using binding assays with recombinant filovirus glycoprotein, we identified cell attachment as the step impaired in filovirus entry in SH-SY5Y cells. Individual overexpression of attachment factors T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1), Axl, Mer, or dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) rendered SH-SY5Y cells susceptible to filovirus glycoprotein-driven transduction. Our study reveals that a lack of attachment factors limits filovirus entry and provides direct experimental support for a model of filoviral cell attachment where host factor usage at the cell surface is highly promiscuous.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zapatero-Belinch\u00F3n, Francisco J.; Dietzel, Erik; Dolnik, Olga; D\u00F6hner, Katinka; Costa, Rui; Hertel, Barbara; Veselkova, Barbora; Kirui, Jared; Klintworth, Anneke; Manns, Michael P.; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Pietschmann, Thomas; Krey, Thomas; Ciesek, Sandra; Gerold, Gisa; Sodeik, Beate; Becker, Stephan; von Hahn, Thomas","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/040c9714be80e4a337f6737d17e94171c25cc076.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Niemann\u2013Pick Disease C1"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filovirus entry","model of filoviral cell attachment","filoviral glycoprotein-driven cell entry","endosomal phase of cell entry","tested cell lines","nonlymphocytic cell line SH-SY5Y","lack of attachment factors","SH-SY5Y cells susceptible","Individual overexpression of attachment factors T-cell immunoglobulin","susceptible cells","productive entry","filovirus infection","Global gene expression profiling of known cell surface entry factors","wide range of cell types","recombinant filovirus glycoprotein","dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","functional intracellular factors","filovirus glycoprotein-driven transduction","specific host factor","Heterokaryons of SH","minimal set of host factors","host factor usage","restriction factor","enabling factor critical","Filoviruses","earlier steps of filoviral infection","protein expression levels","intracellular proteins cathepsin B","Numerous plasma membrane proteins","direct experimental support","mucin domain","Disease C1","NPC1","DC-SIGN","non-integrin","TIM","ones","Axl","binding assays","susceptibility","correlation","receptor Niemann","exception of lymphocytes","study","pore channel"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The expression of fourteen common used reference genes of Oryza sativa L. were evaluated by RT-qPCR in RSV and RBSDV infected rice plants. Suitable normalization reference gene(s) were identified by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: UBQ 10 \u002B GAPDH and UBC \u002B Actin1 were identified as suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization under RSV and RBSDV infection, respectively. When using multiple reference genes, the expression patterns of OsPRIb and OsWRKY, two virus resistance genes, were approximately similar with that reported previously. Comparatively, by using single reference gene (TIP41-Like), a weaker inducible response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that the combination of two reference genes could obtain more accurate and reliable normalization of RT-qPCR results in RSV- and RBSDV-infected plants. This work therefore sheds light on establishing a standardized RT-qPCR procedure in RSV- and RBSDV-infected rice plants, and might serve as an important point for discovering complex regulatory networks and identifying genes relevant to biological processes or implicated in virus.

The initial outbreak of this novel virus in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, first described in December 2019, has since moved on to being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The classic description of COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that manifests with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. However, gastrointestinal (GI) complication of COVID-19 is emerging as well. This was observed with similar viral respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012. In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms. Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness. New studies are expanding our understanding of the possible fecal transmission of COVID-19. Assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided evidence of the virus in the stool and the oropharynx outside the nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Virus in the stool may be evident on presentation and last throughout the course of illness resolution for up to 12 days after the respiratory virus evidence is gone. In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by \u2265 24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19. The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered. Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cipriano, Massimiliano; Ruberti, Enzo; Giacalone, Andrea","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be88b8b8468923d21b61a791fd12381e3e148b7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186097.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351807/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7422","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CDC"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["respiratory virus evidence","respiratory tract","respiratory samples","negative respiratory tests","confirmed COVID","complication of COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome","subsequent development of respiratory symptoms","similar viral respiratory illnesses","fecal-oral transmission of COVID","possible fecal transmission of COVID","novel virus","GI symptoms","SARS-CoV","stool","classic description of COVID","consecutive hospitalized patients","nonspecific GI illness","subtle symptoms","course of illness resolution","rRT-PCR","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","common symptom","New studies","worldwide pandemic","recent studies","transmissibility infection risk","testing","Wuhan","single-center case series","diarrhea","nausea","authors","understanding","fever","oropharynx","days","dry cough","abdominal pain","Disease Control","Prevention","dyspnea","CDC","Hubei province of China","Assessment","nasopharynx","MERS","initial outbreak","Centers","exertion","World Health Organization","presentation","lessons","potential","needs","hours","cases","investigators","feces","news","fact"],"language":"en"},

As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual\u0027s right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation.

However, imported malaria cases from Africa and Southeast Asia still occur in China due to overseas laborers. Diagnosis by microscopy is the gold standard for malaria and is used in most hospitals in China. However, the current capacity of microscopists to manage malaria cases in hospitals and public health facilities to meet the surveillance needs to eliminate and prevent the reintroduction of malaria is unknown. METHODS: Malaria diagnoses were assessed by comparing the percentage of first visit and confirmed malaria diagnoses at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and hospitals. The basic personnel information for public health departments and hospitals at different levels was investigated. The skills of microscopists for blood smear preparation and slide interpretation were also examined at the county and township levels. RESULTS: Inaccurate rate with 13.49% and 7.32%, respectively, in 2013 and 2014, from 341 and 355 reported cases from sub-provincial levels in Jiangsu province. Most of the 523 malaria cases reported in Nantong Prefecture from 2000 to 2014 involved patients who first visited county CDCs seeking treatment, however, none of these cases received confirmed diagnosis of malaria in townships or villages.The staff at county CDCs and hospitals with a higher education background performed better at making and interpreting blood smears than staff from townships. CONCLUSIONS: The network for malaria elimination in an entire province has been well established. However, an insufficient capacity for malaria diagnosis was observed, especially the preparing and reading the blood smears at the township and village levels, which is a challenge to achieving and maintaining malaria elimination.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Guisheng; Zhu, Guoding; Cao, Caiqun; Miao, Ping; Cao, Yuanyuan; Wang, Weiming; Gu, Yaping; Xu, Sui; Wang, Shengqiang; Zhou, Huayun; Cao, Jun","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9cabdd892daccdddc682fef1749e2475a7e5fa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5898017.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5307-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29650008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Malaria Elimination Action","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["China","Africa","Southeast Asia","Jiangsu"],"keyphrases":["malaria cases","malaria diagnosis","reintroduction of malaria","confirmed diagnosis of malaria","confirmed malaria diagnoses","hospitals","Local malaria transmission","National Malaria Elimination Action Plan","reported cases","county CDCs","township levels","China","village levels","different levels","interpreting blood smears","sub-provincial levels","staff","townships","public health departments","public health facilities","blood smear preparation","current capacity of microscopists","skills of microscopists","Jiangsu province","entire province","insufficient capacity","higher education background","Centers","Disease Control","villages","basic personnel information","slide interpretation","Prevention","visit","Southeast Asia","involved patients","Nantong Prefecture","microscopy","gold standard","network","percentage","Africa","challenge","surveillance","preparing","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Inaccurate rate","overseas laborers","treatment","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males \u003C females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone/low prenatal estrogen). Aim To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. Study design: COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). Subjects 103,482 men and 83,366 women. Outcome measures Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. Results Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. Conclusions At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone/high prenatal estrogen) is associated with high CFRs and percent male mortality. At the individual level, high 2D:4D may be a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 in males. We speculate that male 2D:4D is a negative correlate for expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2).","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manning, John T.; Fink, Bernhard","journal":"Early human development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d383d8107a61b5842e3b23c9aeaff3c23a1080f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419720/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220302929; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220302929?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BBC","CFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high CFRs","national level","national male death rates","high mean","high prenatal estrogen","high prenatal testosterone","national values of COVID","percent of male deaths","percent male mortality","percentage of male deaths","low prenatal estrogen","low prenatal testosterone","Outcome measures Relationships of mean national","sex-specific relationships","positive relationships","positive association of male right","sex bias","severity of COVID","reported national case fatality rates","countries","females","left hand","proxy of fetal sex steroids","individual level","Study design","BBC Internet Study","large online survey","expression","Abstract Background","fingers","SARS-CoV2 receptor","negative correlate","coronavirus disease","digit ratio","index","risk factor","ring","influence of female","ACE2","Conclusions","relative lengths","Subjects","women"],"language":"en"},

However, few studies have been conducted on the infection of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) associated with pediatric community\u2010acquired pneumonia in China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between July 2008 and June 2010 from 1,028 children, aged \u226416.5 years, who were diagnosed with community\u2010acquired pneumonia in Beijing, China. Reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to screen the samples for hMPV and common respiratory viruses. hMPV was detected in 6.3% of the patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia. This detection rate is the third highest for a respiratory virus in children with community\u2010acquired pneumonia, after that of rhinovirus (30.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (30.7%).

Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [(35)S]GTP\u03B3S assays). The human H(1)R was co-expressed with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 or GAIP, which unmasked a productive interaction between hH(1)R and insect cell G\u03B1(q). By contrast, functional expression of the hH(2)R required the generation of an hH(2)R-Gs\u03B1 fusion protein to ensure close proximity of G protein and receptor. Fusion of hH(2)R to the long (Gs\u03B1(L)) or short (Gs\u03B1(S)) splice variant of G\u03B1(s) resulted in comparable constitutive hH(2)R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH(1)R/hH(2)R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH(1)R/gpH(2)R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH(3)R with G\u03B1(i1), G\u03B1(i2), G\u03B1(i3), and G\u03B1(i/o) in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li(\u002B), Na(\u002B), K(\u002B)) and anions (Cl(\u2212), Br(\u2212), I(\u2212)) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH(3)R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH(3)R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH(3)R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH(3)R, the hH(4)R preferentially couples to co-expressed G\u03B1(i2) in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTP\u03B3S. The hH(4)R shows structural instability and adopts a G protein-independent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH(4)R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH(4)R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of H(x)R pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schneider, Erich H.; Seifert, Roland","journal":"Histamine and Histamine Receptors in Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eef81233541c4504a9dc542873a5a8dca4a313e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120522.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R protein","R activity","R state","R antagonists","R mutants","Fusion of hH","inactive hH","specific hH","series of hH","R-Gs\u03B1 fusion protein","comparable constitutive hH","Sf9 cells","G protein variants","regulators of G protein","G protein isoforms","insect cell G\u03B1","co-expressed G\u03B1","high constitutive activity","close proximity of G protein","G protein-independent high-affinity state","Sf9 cell system","human histamine receptor subtypes","activity relationships","splice variant of G\u03B1","Sf9 insect cell expression system","Co-expression","functional expression","GTP\u03B3S assays","large problem of histamine receptor research","receptor activation event","molecular modeling approaches","radioligand binding assays","Medicinal chemistry studies","inverse agonists","i2","steady-state GTPase assays","molecular pharmacology of GPCRs","pathways of mammalian cells","contrast","anions","use of different species orthologues","comparable interaction efficiency","profound species differences","Various experimental approaches","comparison of various cations","productive interaction","mutational studies","guinea pig orthologues gpH","data heterogeneity","large radii","results of pharmacological","published results","functional readouts proximal","different GDP affinities","deeper understanding of H","detailed characterization of affinity","Potential sodium binding sites","structure","complex","conclusions","couples","significant implications","GAIP","NaCl","structural instability","combination","RGS4","summary","i1","i3","chapter","causes","generation","Br"],"language":"en"},

They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable. Alternatively, the scientific community could step up efforts to generate a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses that provides broadly cross-reactive protection through the induction of antibodies or T cells to conserved regions of the virus.","publish_time":"2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiMenna, Lauren J.; Ertl, Hildegund C.

The so-called \u201Cpassive vaccination\u201D, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe\u2019s life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.","publish_time":"2009-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giefing, Carmen; Nagy, Eszter; von Gabain, Alexander","journal":"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee8bdbed9a9bf20bb1e4922c70f85680d6f00f71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific antibodies","identification of specific antigens","specific protein antigens","treatment of specific cancers","specific site","treatment of bacterial infections","neutralizing antibodies","foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies","monoclonal antibody technology","identification of suitable target antigens","resort treatment","therapy of infectious diseases","management of infections","prevention","growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens","variety of devastating diseases","suitable targets","antibody species","passive vaccination","development of novel subunit vaccines","successful treatments","biotechnology","possible applications","perspective","unlimited quantities","cancerous cells","high affinity","various technologies","antibiotics","proven record","hallmark","robust platform","important role","microbe\u2019s life cycle","immune system","decontamination","human counterparts","reasonable costs","entire genome sequence of pathogens","potential","options","medical arena","function","proteins","order","protective immunity","availability","dual mode","overview of current efforts","given antigen","hand","Progress","single immunogen","following chapter","New strategies","cell growth","years"],"language":"en"},

The TCR repertoire and relative proportions of various T cell subsets are established in the thymus, and continue to be shaped and regulated in the periphery. As the thymic function declines, peripheral homeostatic mechanisms assume increasing importance. Indeed, loss of thymic function does not lead to progressive decline of T cell numbers because peripheral mechanisms ensure that the size of the T cell population is maintained due to proliferation of residual cells. However, our current understanding of the basic mechanisms of \u2018homeostatic\u2019 or lymphopenia-induced proliferation suggests that this drive to maintain population size may be accompanied by loss of TCR diversity and emergence of auto-reactive effector T cells. This prediction is supported by experimental and clinical evidence. This consideration is important because lymphopenia is seen commonly in clinical practice as a consequence of viral infections, or medical treatment of cancer, autoimmunity, and graft rejection. Lymphopenia may be a simple link between viral infections and autoimmunity, and may be one reason for common failure of very potent, but non-specific, immunosuppressive drugs in current clinical use.","publish_time":"2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khoruts, Alexander; Fraser, Joanne M.","journal":"Immunol Lett","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126288.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzgyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mature T cell population","peripheral homeostatic mechanisms","peripheral mechanisms","population size","progressive decline of T cell numbers","reactive effector T cells","relative proportions of various T cell subsets","basic mechanisms","autoimmunity","clinical practice","current clinical use","loss of thymic function","lymphopenia-induced proliferation","clinical evidence","strict homeostatic control","consequence of viral infections","thymic function declines","loss of TCR diversity","proliferation of residual cells","TCR repertoire","current understanding","emergence of auto","immunosuppressive drugs","medical treatment of cancer","simple link","composition","increasing importance","reason","drive","common failure","graft rejection","consideration","prediction","thymus","periphery"],"language":"en"},

We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly\u2013Asp\u2013Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.","publish_time":"2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Pengwei; Xie, Jian; Yi, Guanghui; Zhang, Chuyu; Zhou, Rong","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","GDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA replication","novo initiation of RNA synthesis","mechanism of viral RNA synthesis","polymerase inactive","rGTP","polymerase active site","promotion of polymerase efficiency","CSFV","Asp","mutation","NS5B protein","novo mechanism","GAA","virus RdRps","residues","anti-virus therapy","non-structural protein","GDD motif","Classical swine fever virus","characteristic fingers","fingers domain","three-dimensional model","conformational changes","Gly","N-terminal region","important role","potential target","metal ions","key enzyme","palm","thumb domains","homology modeling","alignment","primer","interaction","Escherichia coli"],"language":"en"},

Placental extract was orally administered once daily until the behavioral analysis was carried out. Chronic treatment with both doses of placental extract improved the OVX/stress-induced fear memory impairment and Nissl-positive cell loss of the hippocampal CA3 region, although it did not affect the loss of bone mineral density and increase in body weight after OVX.

This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier\u0027s (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.","publish_time":"2003-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poser, Charles M.","journal":"J Neurol Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzIyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS","BBB","enlargement of MS lesions","actual target of MS","viral infection","viral protein","result","clinical manifestations","immune system","role of mild","asymptomatic condition","recognized fact","bystander demyelination","process of lesion formation","central nervous system","initiating","development","blood-brain barrier\u0027s","unanswered questions","particular of T lymphocytes","experimental evidence","antigenic challenge","concussional trauma","individuals","state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness","forming cell","facilitator","increased permeability","oligodendrocyte","trigger","impermeability","commonest causes of progression","edema","disease","change","trait","mechanisms","onset","Multiple sclerosis","order","vaccination","alteration","inflammation"],"language":"en"},

Five of six prepubertal colts inoculated intranasally remained infected in the reproductive tract from post-challenge day 28 to 93 and two of six from post-challenge day 120 to 180. No virus was detected in five of these animals killed on post-challenge day 210. Each of two peripubertal colts remained infected in the reproductive tract at post-challenge day 60 and one of nine was found to be persistently infected with EAV 15 months after challenge. These findings confirm that the virus can replicate in the reproductive tract of a significant proportion of colts for a variable period of time after clinical recovery in the absence of circulating concentrations of testosterone equivalent to those found in sexually mature stallions. Long-term persistent infection with EAV does not appear to occur in colts exposed to the virus before the onset of peripubertal development.

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-\u03B2-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.","publish_time":"1995-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meulenberg, Janneke J.M.; Petersen-Den Besten, Annelien; De Kluyver, Eric P.; Moormann, Rob J.M.; Schaaper, Wim M.M.; Wensvoort, Gert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antisera"],"organizations":["LV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein","nucleocapsid protein","protein composition","LV virions","unglycosylated membrane protein","virus particles","N-glycans","porcine anti-LV serum","kDa","equine arteritis virus","genome of Lelystad virus","translation products of ORFs","positive-strand RNA virus","N-acetyl","antipeptide sera","simian hemorrhagic fever virus","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","amino acid sequences of ORFs","LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages","complex glycans","structural proteins","yielded proteins","high-mannose glycans","putative viral proteins","amino acids","translation of transcripts","Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter","immunoperoxidase monolayer assay","endo-\u03B2","open reading frames","length","d-glucosaminidase","plasmids","Golgi compartment","corresponding genes","antibodies","ORF6","ORF7","Synthetic polypeptides","Antisera","rabbits","ORF5"],"language":"en"},

The Escherichia coli that cause the disease possess special attributes of virulence that allow them to colonize the small intestine and produce an enterotoxin that causes hypersecretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen. These enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are shed into the environment by infected animals in the herd and are ingested by newborn calves soon after birth. There is some natural immunity to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, however, it often fails to protect calves born and raised under modern husbandry conditions. Hence, methods have been developed to stimulate protective immunity by vaccination of the dam.

It would take volumes to adequately discuss respiratory infections in all their complexity, and by the time any manuscript gets into print, it is likely to be outdated because of the rapid advances in the area of virology and antimicrobial agents. This review in no way claims completeness for any one subject, but an attempt has been made to bring into focus and with some sort of organization the vast amount of information in the literature, recent and old, relative to acute respiratory infections. Perhaps the most encouraging aspects of acute respiratory infections are the mildness and short duration of the vast majority of these diseases, aspects which have been well expressed by A. A.

Pronounced differences have been observed in the interactions between the virus and cell surfaces, suggesting that influenza C virus attaches to the receptors different from those recognized by other myxoviruses. While influenza A and B viruses agglutinate erythrocytes from many species, including humans, the spectrum of erythrocytes agglutinated by influenza C virus is much more restricted. Erythrocytes from rats, mice, and adult chickens are suitable for hemagglutination and hemadsorption tests; cells from other species, however, react not at all or only poorly with influenza C virus. Differences are also observed so far as hemagglutination inhibitors are concerned. A variety of glycoproteins have been shown to prevent influenza A and B viruses from agglutinating erythrocytes. In the case of influenza C virus, rat serum was for a long time the only known hemagglutination inhibitor. A difference in the receptors for influenza C virus and other myxo-viruses was also suggested by studies on the receptor-destroying enzyme. The ability of influenza C virus to inactivate its own receptors was reported soon after the first isolation of this virus from a patient. However, the influenza C enzyme did not affect the receptors of other myxoviruses and, conversely, the receptor-destroying enzyme of either of the latter viruses was unable to inactivate the receptors for influenza C virus on erythrocytes. While the enzyme of influenza A and B virus was characterized as a neuraminidase in the 1950s, even with refined methodology no such activity was detectable with influenza C virus. It is now known that both the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities, as well as the fusion activity of influenza C virus are mediated by the only glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle. The structure and functions of this protein, which is designated as HEF, are reviewed in this chapter.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrler, Georg; Klenk, Hans-Dieter","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of influenza C virus","ability of influenza C virus","influenza C enzyme","enzyme of influenza","fusion activity of influenza C virus","virus particle","B viruses","spectrum of erythrocytes","agglutinating erythrocytes","receptors different","myxoviruses","myxo-viruses","receptor-binding","species","known hemagglutination inhibitor","hemagglutination inhibitors","patient","isolation","differences","rat serum","long time","adult chickens","hemadsorption tests","cell surfaces","mice","refined methodology","rats","cells","interactions","humans","activities","glycoprotein present","neuraminidase","studies","HEF","structure","functions","variety of glycoproteins","chapter","aspects"],"language":"en"},

Because of the strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles, the chapter restricts the description of the genetic associations to only the most recent data, mainly generated by molecular means, and because they supercede in precision and accuracy the previous data obtained by serological methods. Because the HLA system displays the unusual feature of strong linkage disequilibrium between loci and alleles, the genetic traits found to be associated with disease do not emerge at random. The pattern of genetic associations follow an almost constant trend. The associations gain strength each time an additional locus centromeric to the precedent is individualized. The advances made in this respect almost parallel the introduction of progressively more refined typing procedures, which allow the division of former genetic entities (loci and alleles) into additional subtypes. Among the HLA-associated diseases, or at least for those diseases in which an autoimmune process is suspected to be directly relevant to the pathogenesis, the associations are with genes and molecules of the HLA-D region (HLA class II genes and products).

In this survey we draw attention to the many infective agents which have to be considered in the investigation of cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The examination of faecal samples in the microbiology laboratory is becoming increasingly complex requiring as it does the use of additional new techniques for previously unrecognised bacterial, viral and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis including, in the last two decades, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, Norwalk virus and Cryptosporidium. These investigations are however expensive and in the face of increasing pressure to economise, it is of paramount importance that the best use should be made of the resources available. To this end we make recommendations about the information that should accompany faecal and other samples submitted to the laboratory from outbreaks of gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2005-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, G.C.; Anderson, R.

During this chronic disease process, characteristic measles virus inclusions are present in the cells of the central nervous system (CNS). During SSPE, infectious virus is not present either in the CNS or other tissues, but it has proved possible, in some cases, to rescue a measles-like virus by cocultivation techniques. These viruses may differ from measles virus, and from each other, but no single, stable property differentiates them. Differences between various strains of measles virus are of a similar magnitude to those observed between SSPE and measles viruses. This chapter discusses experiments to differentiate these agents using monoclonal antibodies raised against purified measles virus Edmonston. In no case is an isolate of measles virus available from the acute phase of infection preceding the develoment of SSPE by the same patient. This event is modeled in vitro by using a tissue culture of Vero cells persistently infected with an SSPE virus \u201CLec,\u201D and this system is compared to other carrier cultures. These in vitro persistent infections differ from any in vivo persistence, because they are maintained in the absence of an immune response and may provide an insight into the importance of that phenomenon in the development of SSPE.","publish_time":"2008-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carter, Michael J.; Meulen, V.

In this work, a metapopulation model, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows, which overcomes the assumption of homogeneous mixing between different regions was constructed. The TB model was combined to a simple demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries).

Moreover, the impact of increasing migration rate between patches on the TB spread was quantified using numerical implementation of the model.

Under in vitro conditions, partial proteolytic peptide mapping identified differences between the two outer capsid proteins of these virus and no difference in inner capsid protein was observed. Since it has been observed by us and others that the gene coding for VP4 protein plays a significant role in determining virulence, the variability observed in the present study between the 84 k proteins (VP4) provided a basis for further investigations in order to locate a potential virulence determinant. A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts. Like their parents, BRV and MRV isolates, reassortants obtained by replacement of gene 4 in BRV with MRV gene 4 indicated that the dose of the virus isolate used and the clinical outcome in vivo was determined by gene segment 4.

It briefly mentions clinical diseases and syndromes such as influenza, respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, and arbovirus infections resulting from virus infections. Viruses causing respiratory diseases, as well as many other diseases in humans are also discussed in the chapter. It describes the vaccines that are used to check the attack of different viruses as well as their cost-effectiveness. There is a list of some viruses that have been ranked according to different variables in an attempt to select a good candidate for an antiviral drug. The incidence of the viral disease is naturally an important factor, as is the severity of the disease. The incidence can be obtained for diseases being reported in accordance with local regulations, but in many cases viral diseases are not reported and the incidence has to be calculated from different surveys. Also, a grading of the severity is not easy and an example is when herpesvirus infections are handled as a group, which includes both herpes encephalitis and cold sores. The greatest challenges and probably the most difficult and medically important areas for prophylaxis and therapy of viral diseases are the viruses that are rapidly changing in antigenic composition and/or viruses with animal reservoirs (influenza and arboviruses) and those forming latent infections (herpesviruses).","publish_time":"2008-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzcyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory diseases","therapy of viral diseases","cases viral diseases","clinical diseases","arbovirus infections","herpesvirus infections","latent infections","attack of different viruses","incidence","respiratory tract infections","influenza","prophylaxis","severity","different variables","different surveys","chapter","important areas","important factor","hepatitis","arboviruses","syndromes","chemotherapy","animal reservoirs","good candidate","herpes encephalitis","attempt","group","local regulations","example","need","antiviral drug","cold sores","accordance","antigenic composition","greatest challenges","grading","herpesviruses","humans","cost-effectiveness","list","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

While early studies suggested demyelination is due to direct cytolytic effects of virus on oligodendrocytes, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the mechanism of demyelination. In this study we have asked whether demyelination can occur in the absence of functional MHC class I expression and CD8(\u002B) T cells. We infected transgenic mice lacking expression of \u03B2(2) microglobulin (\u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) mice) with MHV-A59. In \u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) mice, virus was much more lethal than in either of the parental strains used to produce the mice; furthermore, while clearance from the CNS did occur in \u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) mice, it was slower than in C57BL/6 mice. This is consistent with the importance of CD8(\u002B) cells in viral clearance. Because of the increased sensitivity of the \u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) mice to infection, only low levels of virus could be used to evaluate chronic disease. Even at these low levels, demyelination did occur in some animals. To compare infection in \u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) and C57BL/6 mice we used a higher dose of an attenuated variant of MHV-A59, C12. The attenuated variant induced less demyelination in C57BL/6 mice compared to wild type A59, but the levels observed were not significantly different from those seen in \u03B2(2)M(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Thus, MHV-induced demyelination can occur in some animals in the absence of MHC class I and CD8(\u002B) cells.","publish_time":"2004-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gombold, James L.; Sutherland, Robyn M.; Lavi, Ehud; Paterson, Yvonne; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transgenic mice","expression of \u03B2","C57BL","MHV-induced demyelination","mechanism of demyelination","low levels of virus","MHV-A59","attenuated variant of MHV","absence of MHC class","importance of CD8","Mouse hepatitis virus","chronic disease","animals","T cells","infection","absence of functional MHC class","direct cytolytic effects of virus","chronic demyelinating disease","wild type A59","viral clearance","oligodendrocytes","immune system","higher dose","involvement","evidence","C12","microglobulin","early studies","parental strains","increased sensitivity","CNS","study"],"language":"en"},

Four out of the five biopsy specimens on extended culture incubation at 33\u00B0C yielded a coronavirus virus (EBNV) which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and Vero cells. In cells inoculated with EBNV, cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was found using antisera for human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E as well as the porcine transmissible gastroenteric virus and avian (chicken) bronchitis virus. In neutralization tests, EBNV failed to react with antisera to these viruses. Using hyperimmune serum raised with EBNV, positive cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was seen with cells infected with OC43, 229E, TGV and significantly with the kidney tissue of the biopsy specimens from the EBN patients. A screen for neutralizing antibody using the EBN virus revealed that 87.2% of EBN patients on dialysis were positive, also 74% of people from an endemic area were also positive, while only 13.5% from outside were positive.

The aim was to identify new predictors for ARDS patient prognosis, including those with clinical, pathophysiological, and atypical immunodeficiency. METHODS: ARDS patients were retrospectively included. The patients were grouped and analysed according to different oxygenation index grades and prognosis, and factors influencing prognosis and survival were examined. Adolescent patients, patients with typical immunodeficiency and patients who died within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS were excluded. The predictive value for mortality was determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: In total, 201 patients who fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS were included. The severity of critical illness on the day of enrolment, as measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (P = 0.016), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P = 0.027), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P = 0.000), worsened from mild to severe ARDS cases. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older and had higher APACHE II and SOFA scores. Moreover, significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios and leukocyte counts were found among non-survivors than survivors (P = 0.008, P = 0.012). A moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/neutrophil and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (P = 0.023) was observed. In predicting 100-day survival in patients with ARDS, the area under the curve (AUC) for the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was significantly higher than those for the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio alone, body mass index (BMI) alone, and the lymphocyte count alone (P = 0.0062, 0.0001, and 0.0154). Age (per log(10) years), BMI \u003C 24, SOFA score, leukocyte count, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in ARDS patients. Additionally, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio \u003C 0.0537 had increased 28-day mortality rates (P = 0.0283). Old age affected both 28-day and 100-day mortality rates (P = 0.0064,0.0057). CONCLUSIONS: Age (per log(10) years), BMI \u003C 24, SOFA score, lymphocytes, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 100-day mortality in patients with ARDS. The lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may represent a potential molecular marker to evaluate atypical immunosuppression or impairment in patients with ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Min; Liu, Yijie; Lu, Zhiwen; Luo, Hong; Peng, Hong; Chen, Ping","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0d763ec922163714b323b9fd359ff8910c2ef11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PaO"],"organizations":["ARDS","Acute Physiology","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","BMI"],"locations":["Berlin"],"keyphrases":["ARDS patients","Adolescent patients","ARDS patient prognosis","day mortality rates","lower lymphocyte","neutrophil ratios","day survival","severe ARDS cases","Berlin definition of ARDS","day of enrolment","non-survivors","BMI","FiO","PaO","independent predictors","SOFA scores","new predictors","higher APACHE","atypical immunodeficiency","years","Old age","prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome","Acute Physiology","leukocyte counts","atypical immunosuppression","Risk factors","body mass index","different oxygenation index grades","potential molecular marker","Chronic Health Evaluation","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","impairment","Cox proportional hazard analysis","AUC","curve","area","lymphocytes","severity of critical illness","moderate positive correlation","BACKGROUND","adults","predictive value","aim","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Genomic mutations of known viruses (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus) can also be at the origin of variants susceptible to escaping detection by diagnostic tests. New technologies that would allow the simultaneous detection of several blood\u2010transmissible agents are now needed for the development and improvement of screening strategies. DNA microarrays have been developed for use in immunohematology laboratories for blood group genotyping. Their application in the detection of infectious agents, however, has been hindered by additional technological hurdles. For instance, the variability among and within genomes of interest complicate target amplification and multiplex analysis. Advances in biosensor technologies based on alternative detection strategies have offered new perspectives on pathogen detection; however, whether they are adaptable to diagnostic applications testing biologic fluids is under debate. Elsewhere, current nanotechnologies now offer new tools to improve the sample preparation, target capture, and detection steps.

A rare case of immature gastric teratoma causing fetal hydrops and subsequent ACS is presented. The related pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and the importance of timely recognition and appropriate interventions are highlighted. CASE PRESENTATION: The male patient was born preterm, weighing 3.9 kg., by Cesarean section. Prior prenatal ultrasounds were normal, but a scan done just before delivery had findings indicating polyhydramnios, fetal ascites, and meconium peritonitis. Upon delivery, the patient had respiratory distress, anasarca and a massively distended abdomen. Resuscitation measures, including ventilatory support, were instituted. Imaging studies showed ascites as well as a large, complex intra-abdominal lesion with calcifications. In the succeeding hours, anuria persisted, anasarca worsened, the abdomen became more distended, and inotrope requirements increased. The occurrence of ACS, from what was presumed to be a retroperitoneal teratoma, was therefore considered. Laparotomy was done on the 28th hour of life, with en bloc excision of a massive tumor and attached section of the greater curvature of the stomach. Passage of urine occurred intra-operatively, and the patient was soon after weaned off inotropes and ventilator support. The histopathologic result was immature gastric teratoma. No chemotherapy was given, and the patient\u2019s serum AFP is at normal levels 15 months following surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of a massive intra-abdominal lesion can result in the pathophysiologic continuum of hydrops fetalis and neonatal ACS. The early recognition of such an association can enable appropriate expectant management of similarly affected neonates, including emergent decompression laparotomy.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caballes, Alvin B.; Dungca, Leona Bettina P.; Uy, Maria Esterlita V.; Torralba, Maria Geraldine C.; Embuscado, Cristina Marie G.","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d982f8ee04ea562692ba512d28a8aeff42e41927.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","AFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fetal hydrops","massive intra-abdominal lesion","neonatal ACS","subsequent ACS","occurrence of ACS","complex intra-abdominal lesion","fetal ascites","pathophysiologic continuum of hydrops fetalis","rare case of immature gastric teratoma","anasarca","delivery","male patient","retroperitoneal teratoma","distended abdomen","abdominal compartment syndrome","massive tumor","normal levels","appropriate interventions","attached section","CASE PRESENTATION","ventilatory support","early recognition","histopathologic result","ventilator support","Cesarean section","appropriate expectant management","importance of timely recognition","related pathophysiologic mechanisms","emergent decompression laparotomy","en bloc excision","neonates","conditions","association","findings","polyhydramnios","presence","patient\u2019s serum AFP","greater curvature","respiratory distress","hour of life","months","scan","calcifications","meconium peritonitis","Prior prenatal ultrasounds","Resuscitation measures","succeeding hours","anuria","surgery","inotropes","high mortality rates","inotrope requirements","stomach","Imaging studies","CONCLUSION","Passage of urine","BACKGROUND","chemotherapy"],"language":"en"},

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clauw, Daniel J.","journal":"PM R","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b7bf82cb2c185080cb15545f5b26a65560c2f65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185768/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["postexertional fatigue","Chronic fatigue syndrome","profound fatigue","presence of fatigue","CFS shares features","abnormalities of neurotransmitters","abnormalities of homeostasis","joint pain","biological components","behavioral components","irritable bowel syndrome","temporomandibular joint dysfunction","somatic symptoms","somatic syndromes","overlap of mood","Disease Control","autonomic dysfunction","Diagnostic criteria","following criteria","strong biological underpinnings","cognition","unrefreshing sleep","impaired memory","low levels of serotonin","nerve growth factors","tender glands","stiff muscles","fibromyalgia","sore throat","sensory processing","diminution of functional activity","infection","norepinephrine","Centers","stress system","illness","inflammation","definite etiology","phenotype","causes","specific diagnosis","Prevention","headaches","months","researchers","Correlations","relative contributions"],"language":"en"},

This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as \u03B1, \u03B4, \u03F5 and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae. On the contrary, the sequence fragments similar to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily including DNA polymerase \u03B2 are not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting their other lineage of polymerization motifs.","publish_time":"1999-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otsuka, Jinya; Kikuchi, Norihiro; Kojima, Shinji","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71f1a9afc05640752c9b1e7259211269352cf7f6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA dependent RNA polymerases","families of polymerization motifs","B of DNA polymerases","sequence motifs similar","sequence motifs of families","monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases","lineage of polymerization motifs","family B DNA polymerases","polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases","polymerization activity of DNA polymerase","variation range of polymerization motifs","DNA polymerase \u03B2","motifs of eubacterial primase","polymerization activities of primases","family C","sequence fragments similar","polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase","archaebacterial primases","nucleotidyltransferase superfamily","phages","physicochemical properties of amino acid residues","telomerase","similarity","category","close evolutionary relation","principal component analysis","reconfirmation","groups","proteins","identification","Leviviridae"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this transposon, named IS5_Av, is related to the ISL2 group of the IS5 family of bacterial IS elements. Despite the apparent intactness of the single open reading frame coding for a DDE transposase and the perfect identity of its 213-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the element is present in only one copy per diploid genome. It does not exhibit any detectable levels of transcription, so that its transposase gene appears to be silent in the bdelloid host. Although horizontal transfers of TEs between kingdoms are not known to happen in nature, it appears likely that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga genome relatively recently, but was not successful in adapting to the new host and failed to increase in copy number.

Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lange, Alexander","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/688b6bfb82a32d710ec56564f7051a1af82bc52f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189636.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact of hosts","contact rate","evolution of pathogens","reproductive success of viral pathogens","host-contact network","broad spectrum of viral pathogens","direct physical contact","viral load","new hosts","mode of transmission","immunity of susceptible hosts","transmitted infections","chronic infections","various transmission routes","models intra-","structural aspects","degrees of infectiousness","inter-host dynamics","aspects of pathogenic lifestyles","simulated fitness landscapes","virulence","agent-based simulation","integral equations","unified fashion","antigenic variation","immune escape","author","basic work","childhood diseases","local maxima","functioning","size","explicit connection","networks","parameters","certain likelihood","earlier results","well-defined ways of life","answer","structure","probability","mathematical framework","influenza","biological question","paper","measles","HCV","weeks","days","vectors","grounds"],"language":"en"},

A special characteristic that distinguishes viral fusion proteins from most cellular proteins is the extensive conformational change they undergo during fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Many viral proteins fold in conjunction with and dependent on a viral partner protein, sometimes even synthesized from the same mRNA. Relevant for folding is that viral glycoproteins from the same or related virus families may consist of overlapping sets of domain modules.

However, such information is not usually found in medical records, making studies in the area difficult. Therefore, it is common to use composite indices that characterize a region socioeconomically, such as the Human Development Index (HDI). The main advantage of the HDI is its understanding and adoption on a global scale. However, its applicability is limited for health studies since its longevity dimension presents mathematical redundancy in regression models. Here we introduce the GeoSES, a composite index that summarizes the main dimensions of the Brazilian socioeconomic context for research purposes. We created the index from the 2010 Brazilian Census, whose variables selection was guided by theoretical references for health studies. The proposed index incorporates seven socioeconomic dimensions: education, mobility, poverty, wealth, income, segregation, and deprivation of resources and services. We developed the GeoSES using Principal Component Analysis and evaluated its construct, content, and applicability. GeoSES is defined at three scales: national (GeoSES-BR), Federative Unit (GeoSES-FU), and intra-municipal (GeoSES-IM). GeoSES-BR dimensions showed a good association with HDI-M (correlation above 0.85). The model with the poverty dimension best explained the relative risk of avoidable cause mortality in Brazil. In the intra-municipal scale, the model with GeoSES-IM was the one that best explained the relative risk of mortality from circulatory system diseases. By applying spatial regressions, we demonstrated that GeoSES shows significant explanatory potential in the studied scales, being a compelling complement for future researches in public health.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrozo, Ligia Vizeu; Fornaciali, Michel; de Andr\u00E9, Carmen Diva Saldiva; Morais, Guilherme Augusto Zimeo; Mansur, Giselle; Cabral-Miranda, William; de Miranda, Marina Jorge; Sato, Jo\u00E3o Ricardo; Amaro J\u00FAnior, Edson","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d46cdfb97473119e0d3775df2045c8da7db82cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HDI","Principal Component Analysis"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["GeoSES-IM","GeoSES-FU","GeoSES-BR dimensions","health studies","socioeconomic dimensions","HDI","composite index","main dimensions","public health","proposed index","relative risk of mortality","poverty dimension","Brazilian socioeconomic context","intra-municipal scale","Human Development Index","applicability","individual\u2019s socioeconomic conditions","relative risk of avoidable cause mortality","longevity dimension","studied scales","Brazilian Census","main advantage","global scale","composite indices","compelling complement","mobility","education","mathematical redundancy","construct","segregation","income","variables selection","wealth","future researches","understanding","theoretical references","significant explanatory potential","good association","Federative Unit","circulatory system diseases","regression models","Principal Component Analysis","adoption","research purposes","deprivation of resources","region","content","medical records","area difficult","services","correlation","quality","spatial regressions","information"],"language":"en"},

In addition we question the allocation of racialised meaning from above implied by the concept of racialisation. Internet discussion forums can act as witnesses to social inequalities and through sharing experiences of racism and marginalisation, an oppositional social perspective may develop. The online exchanges have had offline consequences: social gatherings, charitable donations and campaigns against adverse media representations.

It is an endemic most commonly found at South Asia and has first emerged in Malaysia in 1998. Bats are found to be the main reservoir for this virus, causing disease in both humans and animals. The last outbreak has occurred in May 2018 in Kerala. It is characterized by high pathogenicity and fatality rates which varies from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the disease and on the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Clinical presentations for this virus range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at predicting an effective epitope-based vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus, using immunoinformatics approaches. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Glycoprotein G of the Nipah virus sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the epitopes, namely, BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B Cell Epitope Predictor for B cell and T cell MHC classes II and I. Then, the proposed peptides were docked using Autodock 4.0 software program. Results and Conclusions. The two peptides TVYHCSAVY and FLIDRINWI have showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC class I and MHC class II alleles. Furthermore, considering the conservancy, the affinity, and the population coverage, the peptide FLIDRINWIT is highly suitable to be utilized to formulate a new vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus. An in vivo study for the proposed peptides is also highly recommended.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammed, Arwa A.; Shantier, Shaza W.; Mustafa, Mujahed I.; Osman, Hind K.; Elmansi, Hashim E.; Osman, Isam-Aldin A.; Mohammed, Rawan A.; Abdelrhman, Fatima A.; Elnnewery, Mihad E.; Yousif, Einas M.; Mustafa, Marwa M.; Elfadol, Nafisa M.; Abdalla, Alaa I.; Mahmoud, Eiman; Yagaub, Ahmed A.; Ahmed, Yassir A.; Hassan, Mohamed A.","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e19d178256d9a36d3f224767dddf42294e808700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nipah","Glycoprotein G"],"organizations":["NCBI","Autodock","MHC"],"locations":["South Asia","Malaysia","Kerala"],"keyphrases":["glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus","Nipah virus sequence","proposed peptides","T cell MHC classes","virus range","genus Henipavirus","NiV disease","peptides TVYHCSAVY","study","Sequential B Cell Epitope Predictor","effective epitope-based vaccine","new vaccine","strong binding affinity","asymptomatic infection","fatal encephalitis","antiviral drugs available","peptide FLIDRINWIT","population coverage","treatment","Autodock","BepiPred","MATERIALS","availability of adequate healthcare facilities","Clinical presentations","immunoinformatics approaches","high pathogenicity","fatality rates","Paramyxoviridae family","main reservoir","humans","METHODS","NCBI","alleles","South Asia","software program","Different prediction tools","endemic","epitopes","animals","BACKGROUND","Results","Conclusions","Malaysia","Bats","OBJECTIVE","conservancy","severity","outbreak","Kerala"],"language":"en"},

A growth curve, based on cytopathic effect (CPE), immunofluorescence (IF), hemadsorption (Hads) and hemagglutination (HA), showed that SPTh and PPK cells were most susceptible for cultivation and quantitation of the virus.

ChAT and CGRP mRNAs were studied by in situ hybridization in the lumbar spinal cord and a computerized grain counting procedure was used for quantification. No differences in ChAT mRNA level were found between control and CFA\u2010injected rats. ChAT mRNA level was strongly reduced in EAE 14 days after immunization and then recovered (29 days after immunization). CGRP mRNA increased 14 days after immunization, and then recovered to control level. Extensive long\u2010lasting gliosis developed in the spinal cord and around motoneurones and a transient expression of p75(LNGFR) in motoneurones was also found.

Polarized apical and basolateral protein secretions are a feature of airway epithelium homeostasis. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major human pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory epithelium. However, the consequences of hRSV infection on epithelium secretome polarity and content remain poorly understood. To investigate the hRSV-associated apical and basolateral secretomes, a proteomics approach was combined with an ex vivo pediatric human airway epithelial (HAE) model of hRSV infection (data are available via ProteomeXchange and can be accessed at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ with identifier PXD013661). Following infection, a skewing of apical/basolateral abundance ratios was identified for several individual proteins. Novel modulators of neutrophil and lymphocyte activation (CXCL6, CSF3, SECTM1 or CXCL16), and antiviral proteins (BST2 or CEACAM1) were detected in infected, but not in uninfected cultures. Importantly, CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3 were also detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hRSV-infected infants but not healthy controls. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against RSV was confirmed in vitro using BEAS-2B cells. hRSV infection disrupted the polarity of the pediatric respiratory epithelial secretome and was associated with immune modulating proteins (CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3) never linked with this virus before. In addition, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against hRSV had also never been previously characterized. This study, therefore, provides novel insights into RSV pathogenesis and endogenous antiviral responses in pediatric airway epithelium.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Touzelet, Olivier; Broadbent, Lindsay; Armstrong, Stuart D.; Aljabr, Waleed; Cloutman-Green, Elaine; Power, Ultan F.; Hiscox, Julian A.","journal":"Mol Cell Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c04aef60b135a7b2fa8397ee78668c18c69073c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory epithelium","model of hRSV infection","pediatric airway epithelium","consequences of hRSV infection","antiviral proteins","hRSV-infected infants","pediatric human airway epithelial","epithelium secretome polarity","CXCL6","CSF3","antiviral activity of CEACAM1","CXCL16","pediatric respiratory epithelial secretome","feature of airway epithelium homeostasis","airway tissues","Human respiratory syncytial virus","endogenous antiviral responses","basolateral secretomes","skewing of apical","individual proteins","polarized cells","basolateral abundance ratios","basolateral protein secretions","major human pathogen","immune modulating proteins","RSV pathogenesis","novel insights","B cells","Novel modulators of neutrophil","HAE","lymphocyte activation","interface","NPA","data","SECTM1","proteomics approach","environment","nasopharyngeal aspirates","content","healthy controls","ProteomeXchange","BEAS","addition","BST2","uninfected cultures","study","identifier PXD013661"],"language":"en"},

This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).

The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for decontamination and reuse of FFRs.","publish_time":"2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salter, W.B.; Kinney, K.; Wallace, W.H.; Lumley, A.E.; Heimbuch, B.K.; Wander, J.D.","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a60821b4fca4b0137aab1d5de7b08d001e52a6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decontamination treatment","reuse of FFRs","shortage of N95 FFRs","models of FFRs","FFR shortage","ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps","end user post treatment","simple decontamination technologies","Measured amounts of decontaminants","permissible exposure limit","N95 filtering facepiece respirator","toxicity","pressure","filtration performance","evolution of effective strategies","efforts","biocidal efficacy","severe pandemic","wearers","Health care experts","chemical disinfectants","respiratory protection","suspected toxins","residual chemicals","parameters","encouragement","PEL","research effort","individuals","infectious aerosols","strategy","results","option","Toxic by-products","effectiveness","devices"],"language":"en"},

The hepatotoxicity of phenobarbital and the impact of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activity were investigated prospectively in 12 normal dogs. Phenobarbital was administered for 29 weeks at 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (range, 4.8\u2014 6.6 mg/kg) PO q12h, resulting in therapeutic serum phenobarbital concentrations (20\u201340 \u03BCg/mL).

To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process. Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the \u2018TKF91\u2019 model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm\u0027s close similarity to the Baum\u2013Welch algorithm for training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an \u2018unsupervised\u2019 fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates.

Close contact with symptomatic patients appears to be the main route of transmission, whereas blood transfusion trans\u2010 mission could not be ruled out. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) detection kit developed by C. Drosten (Bernhard Nocht Institute, BNI) was used to amplify SARS\u2010CoV sequences from blood donor samples. We tested 31,151 blood donor samples in minipools of up to 96 samples. To validate the sensitivity of the assay, routine donor minipools (88 \u00B1 8 samples per pool) were spiked with plasma of an imported case of SARS or of a subsequently infected contact person, respectively. Gamma\u2010irradiated cell culture supernatants of Vero E6 cells, infected with SARS\u2010CoV, were used as positive controls. RESULTS: None of 31,151 blood donors were positive for the presence of SARS. Two 96\u2010member plasma pools that were each spiked with 100 \u00B5L of plasma of the German index patient or his wife, respectively, were positive. Overall, 0.85 percent of test results had to be considered invalid owing to negative internal controls. CONCLUSION: A real\u2010time CoV PCR test is able to detect SARS\u2010CoV in viremic blood donor samples even in the beginning of the disease when patients present minor clinical symptoms. Thus the assay could potentially help to prevent transfusion\u2010associated SARS\u2010CoV transmissions.","publish_time":"2004-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmidt, Michael; Brixner, Veronika; Ruster, Brigitte; Hourfar, Michael K.; Drosten, Christian; Preiser, Wolfgang; Seifried, Erhard; Roth, W.

Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal\u2010BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal\u2010BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but are discrete lineages.","publish_time":"2006-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"TOMITAKA, YASUHIRO; OHSHIMA, KAZUSATO","journal":"Mol Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87634587c3e88e58b6833a638bdf4de5d55ae03e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["East Asia","Japan","China"],"keyphrases":["Japanese TuMV isolates","Brassica plants","BR population","lineage of nonrecombinant isolates","BR lineage","Japanese populations","population genetic approach","China","genetic structure of populations","discrete lineages","individual geographical lineages","positions of recombination sites","gene sequence comparisons","results of phylogenetic analysis","recombination type pattern","analysis of mismatch distribution","Turnip mosaic virus","neutral equilibrium model","overall lack of nucleotide diversity","host range","East Asia","deviations","regions","calculations","Raphanus","sudden expansion","Analyses","Kyushu","genomes","study","island"],"language":"en"},

As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one\u2010off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse\u2010textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse\u2010textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non\u2010clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable. These data support observations in the literature concerning the distribution of sapling banks in moist and dry tropical forests.","publish_time":"2009-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeremy, Russell\u2010Smith","journal":"J Veg Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ec3c90c8f59883a1dac01b57eb98e34d71f4cb3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["Sapling distributions","dry sites","saplings of tree species","distribution of sapling banks","common tree species","sapling recruitment","dry soils","Sapling densities","sapling regeneration banks of different forest types","canopy tree species","different rain forest types","rain forest margins","dry season census of saplings","distributions of saplings","dry tropical forests","range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation","majority of saplings","comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles","influence of clonal reproduction","moist soils","undisturbed sites","regeneration pathways","contributions of different life forms","environmental variables","environmental correlates","Canopy cover","floristic quadrat groups","data support observations","northern Australia","respect","seed bank","literature","mortality","processes of seedling","proximity","wider study","cautious interpretation","strength","vicinity of conspecific adults","TWINSPAN classification","impact","exploration of relationships","potential","shrubs","trees","Subsequent analyses"],"language":"en"},

Because it is not directly observable, demonstrating evidence of learners\u2019 cognitive integration remains a challenge. In addition, little is known about preclinical medical students\u2019 approach to diagnostic reasoning despite widespread implementation of clinical reasoning curricula for these early learners. The objectives of this study were to characterize how first-year medical students integrated knowledge to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic and to characterize students\u2019 diagnostic reasoning approach to this clinical scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Student teams analyzed clinical data to formulate hypotheses for the pandemic\u2019s source and submitted reports justifying their hypotheses and treatment recommendations. A content analysis on students\u2019 reports identified codes and themes characterizing the learning content integrated and students\u2019 approaches to diagnostic reasoning tasks. RESULTS: Sixteen problem-solving codes were identified, demonstrating integration of new and previously encountered content from multiple disciplines. A compare-contrast analytical approach was the most commonly employed diagnostic reasoning approach (100%), with a smaller subset of teams also using a causal approach (20%). DISCUSSION: Content analysis of preclinical students\u2019 diagnostic justification tasks provided insights into their approach to diagnostic reasoning, which was most consistent with the search-inference framework rather than a causal approach, likely due to limited pathophysiological knowledge at that point in training. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of cognitive integration can be made explicit through learners\u2019 narrative justification of diagnostic reasoning tasks. Preclinical students\u2019 diagnostic reasoning development has implications for curricular design and implementation for this learner group.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Jennifer M.; Skelton, Joseph A.; Peters, Timothy R.","journal":"Med Sci Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b57a4fe1e6702ccc018cdb7d31858813a585c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["students\u2019 diagnostic reasoning approach","Preclinical students\u2019 diagnostic reasoning development","preclinical medical students\u2019 approach","causal approach","students\u2019 reports","Content analysis of preclinical students\u2019 diagnostic justification tasks","learners\u2019 narrative justification of diagnostic reasoning tasks","students\u2019 approaches","widespread implementation of clinical reasoning curricula","Evidence of cognitive integration","evidence of learners\u2019 cognitive integration","clinical data","learning content","encountered content","clinical scenario","integration of new","compare-contrast analytical approach","multiple disciplines","hypotheses","problem-solving codes","Student teams","limited pathophysiological knowledge","year medical students","smaller subset of teams","implications","insights","curricular design","METHODS","themes","simulated viral pandemic","search-inference framework","pandemic\u2019s source","early learners","INTRODUCTION","DISCUSSION","learner group","MATERIALS","treatment recommendations","CONCLUSIONS","challenge","training","RESULTS","objectives","study","addition"],"language":"en"},

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT.

Using these traits, we predict global viral sharing patterns of 4196 mammal species and show that our simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal validation and an external dataset. We predict high rates of mammalian viral sharing in the tropics, particularly among rodents and bats, and within- and between-order sharing differed geographically and taxonomically.

Among them, membrane proteins constitute approximately 50% of the major drug targets. In the drug discovery pipeline, rapid methods for producing different classes of proteins in a simple manner with high quality are important for structural and functional analysis. Cell-free systems are emerging as an attractive alternative for the production of proteins due to their flexible nature without any cell membrane constraints. In a bioproduction context, open systems based on cell lysates derived from different sources, and with batch-to-batch consistency, have acted as a catalyst for cell-free synthesis of target proteins. Most importantly, proteins can be processed for downstream applications like purification and functional analysis without the necessity of transfection, selection, and expansion of clones. In the last 5 years, there has been an increased availability of new cell-free lysates derived from multiple organisms, and their use for the synthesis of a diverse range of proteins. Despite this progress, major challenges still exist in terms of scalability, cost effectiveness, protein folding, and functionality. In this review, we present an overview of different cell-free systems derived from diverse sources and their application in the production of a wide spectrum of proteins. Further, this article discusses some recent progress in cell-free systems derived from Chinese hamster ovary and Sf21 lysates containing endogenous translocationally active microsomes for the synthesis of membrane proteins. We particularly highlight the usage of internal ribosomal entry site sequences for more efficient protein production, and also the significance of site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids for labeling applications and creation of antibody drug conjugates using cell-free systems. We also discuss strategies to overcome the major challenges involved in commercializing cell-free platforms from a laboratory level for future drug development.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dondapati, Srujan Kumar; Stech, Marlitt; Zemella, Anne; Kubick, Stefan","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b68b1b7684051f7cc280595a43dc26867e7549af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211207.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell lysates","production of proteins","cell-free synthesis of target proteins","overview of different cell-free systems","synthesis of membrane proteins","commercializing cell-free platforms","cell membrane constraints","different classes of proteins","diverse range of proteins","increased availability of new cell-free lysates","wide spectrum of proteins","major drug targets","open systems","different sources","major challenges","future drug development","drug discovery pipeline","main source of drug targets","Sf21 lysates","creation of antibody drug conjugates","efficient protein production","functional analysis","diverse sources","labeling applications","downstream applications","protein folding","recent progress","batch consistency","endogenous translocationally active microsomes","significance of site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids","Chinese hamster ovary","usage of internal ribosomal entry site sequences","simple manner","rapid methods","laboratory level","high quality","cost effectiveness","terms of scalability","flexible nature","necessity of transfection","purification","multiple organisms","attractive alternative","selection","use","catalyst","bioproduction context","functionality","article","expansion of clones","strategies","therapeutic potential","years","review"],"language":"en"},

Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model. Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems\u0027 dynamics. This result is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.","publish_time":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, Paulo Cesar Ventura; Vel\u00E1squez-Rojas, F\u00E1tima; Connaughton, Colm; Vazquez, Federico; Moreno, Yamir; Rodrigues, Francisco A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a227a9ce3bd41ede3c350d1845f04e3d7d439ef7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217501.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease spreading","disease prevalence","disease control","information influence disease","spreading dynamics","diffusion of information awareness","theoretical modeling of epidemic spreading","relative timescale","development of methods","mathematical model","fundamental role","crucial role","efficient methods","individuals aware","epidemic threshold","systems\u0027 dynamics","generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model","fraction of unaware individuals","spread of diseases","new view","major issues","transmission","measures","presence","complex networks","reduction","Human behavior","velocity","network topology","infectious agent","exposure","contagion","results","burden","paper","previous models","decrease","Flexibility"],"language":"en"},

By using hydrophobic surface, ice, and droplet scavenging, a simple impaction and condensing based collection method is reported here. Human subjects were recruited to exhale toward the device for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min. The exhaled breath quickly formed into tiny droplets on the hydrophobic surface, which were subsequently scavenged into a 10 \u00B5L rolling deionized water droplet. The collected EBC was further analyzed using culturing, DNA stain, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colorimetry (VITEK 2) for bacteria and viruses. Experimental data revealed that bacteria and viruses in EBC can be rapidly collected using the method developed here, with an observed efficiency of 100 \u00B5L EBC within 1 min. Culturing, DNA stain, SEM, and qPCR methods all detected high bacterial concentrations up to 7000 CFU/m(3) in exhaled breath, including both viable and dead cells of various types. Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria variants were found dominant in EBC samples using VITEK 2 system. SEM images revealed that most bacteria in exhaled breath are detected in the size range of 0.5\u20131.0 \u00B5m, which is able to enable them to remain airborne for a longer time, thus presenting a risk for airborne transmission of potential diseases. Using qPCR, influenza A H3N2 viruses were also detected in one EBC sample. Different from other devices restricted solely to condensation, the developed method can be easily achieved both by impaction and condensation in a laboratory and could impact current practice of EBC collection. Nonetheless, the reported work is a proof-of-concept demonstration, and its performance in non-invasive disease diagnosis such as bacterimia and virus infections needs to be further validated including effects of its influencing matrix.","publish_time":"2012-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhenqiang; Shen, Fangxia; Li, Xiaoguang; Wu, Yan; Chen, Qi; Jie, Xu; Yao, Maosheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/959c580ae16696d820337df5f221ea7869b71d69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3405091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3405091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Scanning Electron Microscope","EBC","VITEK","SEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5L EBC","collected EBC","EBC samples","non-invasive method","Exhaled breath condensate","developed method","current practice of EBC collection","based collection method","culturing","non-invasive disease diagnosis","DNA stain","SEM images","VITEK","hydrophobic surface","H3N2 viruses","condensation","qPCR methods","droplet scavenging","simple impaction","reported work","deionized water droplet","airborne transmission of potential diseases","Scanning Electron Microscope","risk","polymerase chain reaction","Kocuria variants","high bacterial concentrations","colorimetry","performance","bacterimia","environmental exposure assessment","tiny droplets","dead cells of various types","proof","laboratory","Sphingomonas paucimobilis","concept demonstration","virus infections","size range","observed efficiency","\u00B5m","CFU","longer time","influenza","Experimental data","system","effects","influencing matrix","devices","Human subjects"],"language":"en"},

To classify severity, the A-DROP scale proposed by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), the CURB-65 score of the British Respiratory Society (BTS) and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are widely used in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. To evaluate how correctly these conventional prognostic guidelines for CAP reflect the severity of non-HIV PCP, we retrospectively analyzed 21 patients with non-HIV PCP. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were diagnosed by conventional staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory samples with chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings. We compared the severity of 21 patients with PCP classified by A-DROP, CURB-65, and PSI. Also, patients\u2019 characteristics, clinical pictures, laboratory results at first visit or admission and intervals from diagnosis to start of specific-PCP therapy were evaluated in both survivor and non-survivor groups. RESULTS: Based on A-DROP, 18 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 15 of these 18 (83.3%), and 7/15 (46.7%) died. Based on CURB-65, 19 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 16/19 (84.2%), and 8 of the 16 (50%) died. In contrast, PSI classified 14 as severe or extremely severe; all of the 14 (100%) developed respiratory failure and 8/14 (57.1%) died. There were no significant differences in laboratory results in these groups. The time between the initial visit and diagnosis, and the time between the initial visit and starting of specific-PCP therapy were statistically shorter in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional prognostic guidelines for CAP could underestimate the severity of non-HIV PCP, resulting in a therapeutic delay resulting in high mortality. The most important factor to improve the mortality of non-HIV PCP is early diagnosis and starting of specific-PCP therapy as soon as possible.","publish_time":"2012-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asai, Nobuhiro; Motojima, Shinji; Ohkuni, Yoshihiro; Matsunuma, Ryo; Nakasima, Kei; Iwasaki, Takuya; Nakashita, Tamao; Otsuka, Yoshihito; Kaneko, Norihiro","journal":"Multidiscip Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/618e40d95b850daa3fa1ef4b44299053869c73b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3415119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["British Respiratory Society","Infectious Diseases Society of America","CAP","PSI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of non-HIV PCP","mortality of non-HIV PCP","specific-PCP therapy","respiratory failure","non-survivor groups","Non-HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia","immunosuppressed patients","respiratory samples","British Respiratory Society","Japanese Respiratory Society","CAP","Pneumonia Severity Index","PSI","CURB","laboratory results","initial visit","conventional prognostic guidelines","early diagnosis","conventional staining","time","DROP scale","Infectious Diseases Society of America","high mortality","PCR","computed tomography","chest x-ray","polymerase chain reaction","BTS","clinical pictures","IDSA","admission","patients\u2019 characteristics","therapeutic delay","malignancy","intervals","CONCLUSIONS","score","JRS","BACKGROUND","immunosuppressive agents","significant differences","findings","community","important factor","contrast","METHODS","total"],"language":"en"},

Serum samples from patients diagnosed with falciparum malaria (FM) (n = 20), vivax malaria (VM) (n = 17) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 20) were investigated using multiple proteomic techniques and results were validated by employing immunoassay-based approaches. Specificity of the identified malaria related serum markers was evaluated by means of analysis of leptospirosis as a febrile control (FC). Compared to HC, 30 and 31 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p\u003C0.05) serum proteins were identified in FM and VM respectively, and almost half (46.2%) of these proteins were commonly modulated due to both of the plasmodial infections. 13 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in FM compared to VM. Functional pathway analysis involving the identified proteins revealed the modulation of different vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation in malaria. A panel of identified proteins consists of six candidates; serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein and apolipoprotein A-I was used to build statistical sample class prediction models. By employing PLS-DA and other classification methods the clinical phenotypic classes (FM, VM, FC and HC) were predicted with over 95% prediction accuracy. Individual performance of three classifier proteins; haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-I and retinol-binding protein in diagnosis of malaria was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The discrimination of FM, VM, FC and HC groups on the basis of differentially expressed serum proteins demonstrates the potential of this analytical approach for the detection of malaria as well as other human diseases.","publish_time":"2012-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ray, Sandipan; Renu, Durairaj; Srivastava, Rajneesh; Gollapalli, Kishore; Taur, Santosh; Jhaveri, Tulip; Dhali, Snigdha; Chennareddy, Srinivasarao; Potla, Ankit; Dikshit, Jyoti Bajpai; Srikanth, Rapole; Gogtay, Nithya; Thatte, Urmila; Patankar, Swati; Srivastava, Sanjeeva","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25bdd8095f71bd8c6be54898b437e16896ea3790.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3415403.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC","FC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum proteins","VM","falciparum malaria","vivax malaria","diagnosis of malaria","detection of malaria","identified malaria related serum markers","classifier proteins","panel of identified proteins","serum amyloid","Serum samples","FC","human serum proteome","discrimination of FM","malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum","HC groups","retinol-binding protein","haptoglobin","apolipoprotein E","identification of potential protein markers","analysis of leptospirosis","human diseases","prediction accuracy","acute phase response","host immune response","Functional pathway analysis","statistical sample class prediction models","consequence of infection","modulation of different vital physiological pathways","classification methods","clinical phenotypic classes","disease pathogenesis","mechanistic insights","hemopexin","cytokine","chemokine","receiver","cascades","candidates","patients","basis","analytical approach","results","characteristic","febrile control","alterations","healthy controls","Specificity","PLS-DA","blood coagulation","Individual performance","multiple proteomic techniques","ROC","curves","immunoassay-based approaches","plasmodial infections","study","half"],"language":"en"},

However, compliance with these strategies is linked to risk perceptions, perceived severity and perceived effectiveness of the strategies. In 2010, we undertook a study to examine the knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, practices and barriers towards influenza and infection control strategies amongst domestic and international university students. METHODS: A study using qualitative methods that incorporated 20 semi-structured interviews was undertaken with domestic and international undergraduate and postgraduate university students based at one university in Sydney, Australia. Participants were invited to discuss their perceptions of influenza (seasonal vs. pandemic) in terms of perceived severity and impact, and attitudes towards infection control measures including hand-washing and the use of social distancing, isolation or cough etiquette. RESULTS: While participants were generally knowledgeable about influenza transmission, they were unable to accurately define what \u2018pandemic influenza\u2019 meant. While avian flu or SARS were mistaken as examples of past pandemics, almost all participants were able to associate the recent \u201Cswine flu\u201D situation as an example of a pandemic event. Not surprisingly, it was uncommon for participants to identify university students as being at risk of catching pandemic influenza. Amongst those interviewed, it was felt that \u2018students\u2019 were capable of fighting off any illness. The participant\u2019s nominated hand washing as the most feasible and acceptable compared with social distancing and mask use. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high levels of interaction that occurs in a university setting, it is really important that students are informed about disease transmission and about risk of infection. It may be necessary to emphasize that pandemic influenza could pose a real threat to them, that it is important to protect oneself from infection and that infection control measures can be effective.","publish_time":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seale, Holly; Mak, Jackie PI; Razee, Husna; MacIntyre, C Raina","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca8ea6f2f3a18ebe13e7b6704e0c684b6d88de4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3447694.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","risk of infection","perceptions of influenza","infection control strategies","influenza transmission","Participants","international university students","risk perceptions","pandemic event","infection control measures","postgraduate university students","university setting","specific pandemic vaccine","attitudes","terms of perceived severity","perceived effectiveness","impact","use of social distancing","disease transmission","study","qualitative methods","swine flu","mask use","participant\u2019s nominated hand washing","avian flu","barriers","practices","antiviral treatment","semi-structured interviews","isolation","situation","SARS","examples of past pandemics","cough etiquette","availability","knowledge","community interventions","high levels of interaction","Sydney","real threat","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Australia","students\u2019","illness","BACKGROUND","compliance"],"language":"en"},

Methods. 755 healthy subjects were allocated to receive either an alcohol extract from freshly harvested E. purpurea (95% herba and 5% root) or placebo. Participants were required to record adverse events and to rate cold-related issues in a diary throughout the investigation period. Nasal secretions were sampled at acute colds and screened for viruses. Results. A total of 293 adverse events occurred with Echinacea and 306 with placebo treatment. Nine and 10% of participants experienced adverse events, which were at least possibly related to the study drug (adverse drug reactions). Thus, the safety of Echinacea was noninferior to placebo. Echinacea reduced the total number of cold episodes, cumulated episode days within the group, and pain-killer medicated episodes. Echinacea inhibited virally confirmed colds and especially prevented enveloped virus infections (P \u003C 0.05). Echinacea showed maximal effects on recurrent infections, and preventive effects increased with therapy compliance and adherence to the protocol. Conclusions. Compliant prophylactic intake of E. purpurea over a 4-month period appeared to provide a positive risk to benefit ratio.","publish_time":"2012-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jawad, M.; Schoop, R.; Suter, A.; Klein, P.; Eccles, R.","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f763d5c729b3a02773062e212f3f2632d2ebb574.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3457740.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of Echinacea","Echinacea purpurea extract","adverse events","month period","adverse drug reactions","total number of cold episodes","prevention of common cold episodes","cold-related issues","investigation period","benefit","placebo treatment","Participants","preventive effects","recurrent infections","maximal effects","pain-killer medicated episodes","acute colds","confirmed colds","study drug","alcohol extract","positive risk","enveloped virus infections","cumulated episode days","group","large population","therapy compliance","diary","efficacy","adherence","protocol","Nasal secretions","Compliant prophylactic intake of","herba","noninferior","ratio","viruses","root","healthy subjects","Objective","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

However, live virus vaccines also cause reactogenic side effects such as fever, myalgia, and injection site pain that have reduced their acceptance in the clinic. Several recent studies have linked vaccine-induced reactogenic side effects to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) in humans. Our objective was therefore to determine whether IL-1\u03B2 contributed to pathology after immunization with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors, and if so, to identify strategies by which IL-1\u03B2 mediated pathology might be reduced without compromising immunogenicity. We found that an rVSV vaccine induced local and systemic production of IL-1\u03B2 in vivo, and that accumulation of IL-1\u03B2 correlated with acute pathology after rVSV immunization. rVSV-induced pathology was reduced in mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor Type I, but the IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice were fully protected from lethal rechallenge with a high dose of VSV. This result demonstrated that IL-1 contributed to reactogenicity of the rVSV, but was dispensable for induction of protective immunity. The amount of IL-1\u03B2 detected in mice deficient in either caspase-1 or the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC after rVSV immunization was not significantly different than that produced by wild type animals, and caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice were only partially protected from rVSV-induced pathology. Those data support the idea that some of the IL-1\u03B2 expressed in vivo in response to VSV may be activated by a caspase-1 and ASC-independent mechanism. Together these results suggest that rVSV vectors engineered to suppress the induction of IL-1\u03B2, or signaling through the IL-1R would be less reactogenic in vivo, but would retain their immunogenicity and protective capacity. Such rVSV would be highly desirable as either vaccine vectors or oncolytic therapies, and would likely be better tolerated in human vaccinees.","publish_time":"2012-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Athearn, Kathleen; Sample, Christopher J.; Barefoot, Brice E.; Williams, Kristi L.; Ramsburg, Elizabeth A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6135c4bb442a034b18ef4e9b3fc5701507225f0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3466325.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV","ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of IL","rVSV vaccine","accumulation of IL","rVSV immunization","rVSV vectors","rVSV-induced pathology","\u03B2 mediated pathology","systemic production of IL","vaccine-induced reactogenic","vaccine vectors","acute pathology","caspase","mice deficient","effects","live virus vaccines","immunogenicity","induction of protective immunity","ASC-independent mechanism","inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC","receptor Type","live viruses","protective capacity","wild type animals","high dose of VSV","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin","myalgia","fever","injection site pain","oncolytic therapies","recent studies","acceptance","idea","response","results","reactogenicity","humans","strategies","multiple routes","human vaccinees","data","clinic","objective"],"language":"en"},

The third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20\u201357 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study for mAb production. The mAbs were selected from EBV transformed cultures with conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin-B containing V3C (V3C-CTB) fusion protein. We tested the mAbs for their binding with HIV-1 derived proteins and peptides by ELISA and for neutralization against HIV-1 viruses by TZM-bl assays. RESULTS: We isolated three anti-V3 mAbs, 277, 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals. The ELISA binding revealed a subtype-C and subtype-A specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mAb 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-B V3. Epitope mapping of mAbs with overlapping V3 peptides showed exclusive binding to V3 crown. The antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively. Overall, we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-V3 mAbs, despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), suggesting that the affinity of mAb might equally be crucial for neutralization, as the epitope recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anti-V3 antibodies derived from subtype-C infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses. Defining the fine epitope specificities of these mAbs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes, unique to clade C or shared with non-clade C viruses, in context of V3 region.","publish_time":"2012-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrabi, Raiees; Kumar, Rajesh; Bala, Manju; Nair, Ambili; Biswas, Ashutosh; Wig, Naveet; Kumar, Pratik; Pal, Rahul; Sinha, Subrata; Luthra, Kalpana","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5678f2e8dc1710c96b5f4e5ae8d6ddae9c5e6580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3493341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ELISA"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-V3 mAbs","anti-V3 antibodies","HIV","subtype-B V3","V3 crown","overlapping V3 peptides","context of V3 region","Epitope mapping of mAbs","non-clade C viruses","neutralizing antibodies","ELISA binding","neutralization potential","exclusive binding","identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes","identification of epitopes","representative native viruses","resistant tier","subtype-C infected Indian patients","presence of epitopes","specific binding of antibody","Analysis of human monoclonal antibodies","years","study","epitope recognition","affinity of mAb","mAb production","low neutralizing activity","fine epitope specificities","V3C-CTB","infected donors","crucial target","derived proteins","variable region","seropositive drug naive patients","conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin","CXCR4","cultures","CCR5","EBV","co-receptor","experimental manipulations","cross reactivity","involvement","females","BACKGROUND","Du156","exposure","fusion protein","TZM-bl assays","age range","gp120","JRFL","envelope glycoprotein","cells of different individuals","median","METHODS","RESULTS","resistance","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: C57BL/6 (B6) and Fas-deficient lpr mice were exposed to either intra-tracheal PBS followed by spontaneous breathing or intra-tracheal LPS followed by four hours mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 150 breaths per minute, inspired oxygen 0.21 and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm of water. RESULTS: Compared with the B6 mice, the lpr mice showed attenuation of the neutrophilic response as measured by decreased numbers of BAL neutrophils and lung myeloperoxidase activity. Interestingly, the B6 and lpr mice had similar concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL1 (KC), and similar measurements of permeability and apoptosis.

We studied the severity, outcomes, and hospital charges of patients with ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza A infection compared with ALI and ARDS from other etiologies. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted that included patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic MICU with ALI/ARDS and confirmed influenza A infection, and all patients admitted with ALI/ARDS from any other etiology from September 2009 to March 2010. An itemized list of individual hospital charges was obtained for each patient from the hospital billing office and organized by billing code into a database. Continuous data that were normally distributed are presented as the mean \u00B1 SD and were analyzed by the Student\u2019s t test. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in proportions between patient subgroups. Data that were not normally distributed were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were studied: 23 in the H1N1 group and 22 in the noninfluenza group. Mean \u00B1 SD age was similar (44 \u00B1 13 and 51 \u00B1 17 years, respectively, p = 0.15). H1N1 patients had lower APACHE III scores (66 \u00B1 20 vs. 89 \u00B1 32, p = 0.015) and had higher Pplat and PEEP on days 1, 3, and 14. Hospital and ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were comparable. SOFA scores over the first 2 weeks in the ICU indicate more severe organ failure in the noninfluenza group (p = 0.017). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the noninfluenza group (77 vs. 39%, p = 0.016). The noninfluenza group tended to have higher overall charges, including significantly higher cost of blood products in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza infection is associated with more severe respiratory compromise but has lower overall acuity and better survival rates than ALI/ARDS due to other causes. Higher absolute charges in the noninfluenza group are likely due to underlying comorbid medical conditions.","publish_time":"2012-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiesen, Jonathan; Komara, John J; Walker, Esteban; Wiedemann, Herbert P; Guzman, Jorge A","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3503790.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI","Fisher"],"organizations":["ALI/ARDS","ARDS","Cleveland Clinic MICU","APACHE III","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["noninfluenza group","hospital charges of patients","ARDS secondary","H1N1 group","H1N1 patients","higher overall charges","H1N1 influenza","Hospital mortality","Higher absolute charges","pandemic influenza infection","higher Pplat","hospital billing office","confirmed influenza","itemized list of individual hospital charges","respiratory complications","severe respiratory compromise","higher cost of blood products","ICU length","mean","acute respiratory distress syndrome","overall acuity","billing code","patient subgroups","SOFA scores","lower APACHE","SD age","high mortality","Continuous data","acute lung injury","severe organ failure","Student\u2019s t test","Wilcoxon rank-sum test","better survival rates","Cleveland Clinic MICU","differences","duration of mechanical ventilation","Critical illness","weeks","outcomes","Fisher exact tests","comorbid medical conditions","chi-square","proportions","retrospective review","PEEP","days","severity","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","database","etiologies","etiology","causes","years","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, to control for these confounding environmental variables in a system that models the levels of genetic diversity found in outbred populations such as humans, we used incipient lines of the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred (RI) panel (the pre-CC population) to study how genetic variation impacts influenza associated disease across a genetically diverse population. A wide range of variation in influenza disease related phenotypes including virus replication, virus-induced inflammation, and weight loss was observed. Many of the disease associated phenotypes were correlated, with viral replication and virus-induced inflammation being predictors of virus-induced weight loss. Despite these correlations, pre-CC mice with unique and novel disease phenotype combinations were observed. We also identified sets of transcripts (modules) that were correlated with aspects of disease. In order to identify how host genetic polymorphisms contribute to the observed variation in disease, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. We identified several QTL contributing to specific aspects of the host response including virus-induced weight loss, titer, pulmonary edema, neutrophil recruitment to the airways, and transcriptional expression. Existing whole-genome sequence data was applied to identify high priority candidate genes within QTL regions. A key host response QTL was located at the site of the known anti-influenza Mx1 gene. We sequenced the coding regions of Mx1 in the eight CC founder strains, and identified a novel Mx1 allele that showed reduced ability to inhibit viral replication, while maintaining protection from weight loss.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferris, Martin T.; Aylor, David L.; Bottomly, Daniel; Whitmore, Alan C.; Aicher, Lauri D.; Bell, Timothy A.; Bradel-Tretheway, Birgit; Bryan, Janine T.; Buus, Ryan J.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Haagmans, Bart L.; McMillan, Leonard; Miller, Darla R.; Rosenzweig, Elizabeth; Valdar, William; Wang, Jeremy; Churchill, Gary A.; Threadgill, David W.; McWeeney, Shannon K.; Katze, Michael G.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S.; Heise, Mark T.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df4824b457c47934bafd828367bb0377132a903c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3585141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3585141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","QTL","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aspects of disease","virus replication","virus-induced weight loss","virus-induced inflammation","influenza disease related phenotypes","differential disease outcomes","predictors of virus","observed variation","genetic variation impacts influenza","novel disease phenotype combinations","viral replication","host genetic polymorphisms","QTL regions","narrow windows of disease symptoms","key host response QTL","pre-CC population","host responses","pre-CC mice","known anti-influenza Mx1 gene","novel Mx1 allele","CC founder strains","wide range of variation","levels of genetic diversity","coding regions of Mx1","diverse population","viral infections","confounding environmental variables","polymorphic genes","outbred populations","environmental factors","human populations","specific aspects","diverse Collaborative Cross","high priority candidate genes","titer","pulmonary edema","study","recombinant","reduced ability","site","neutrophil recruitment","quantitative trait loci","airways","system","panel","genome sequence data","humans","mapping","correlations","protection","incipient lines","modules","order","transcriptional expression","sets of transcripts"],"language":"en"},

Real- or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes\u2013syndromic surveillance\u2013using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. METHODS: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Na\u00EFve Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. RESULTS: High performance (F(1)-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F(1-macro)), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Na\u00EFve Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F(1-micro) = 0.994 and F(1-macro) = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. CONCLUSION: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.","publish_time":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00F3rea, Fernanda C.; Muckle, C.

It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher death rates compared with developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean (PNG) community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared with those obtained from a comparable Australian model. DESIGN: A modelling study. SETTING: The towns of Madang in PNG (population \u223C35 000) and Albany (population \u223C30 000) in Australia. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios. RESULTS: The unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared with the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60\u201370% less effective in a PNG setting compared with an Australian setting. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature.","publish_time":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milne, George J; Baskaran, Pravin; Halder, Nilimesh; Karl, Stephan; Kelso, Joel","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/013d9fb8719d3d3d47738f9f0604f3b643c4df57.json; document_parses/pdf_json/44f01ea111fa2b4bd8ce34739f64b17930bb0ea8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1badb9da3cd92175be22f42538742c07f58eb5f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3612822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PNG"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","PNG setting","developed countries","novel influenza strain","pathogenic influenza strain","low-income countries","PNG-feasible interventions","past influenza pandemics","developed country","Australian setting","naive population","developed nations","modelling study","comparable Australian model","unmitigated scenario","low-income country","social distancing-based interventions strategies","intervention strategies","appropriate pandemic preparedness plans","individual-based model","Mathematical modelling studies","greater impact","spread","results","social distancing intervention scenarios","higher death rates","higher attack rate","cumulative illness attack rates","larger proportion","greater community-wide contact","larger average household size","models","Papua New Guinean","introduction","different demographics","concern","limited guidance","OUTCOME MEASURES","resource constraints","possible occurrence","development","evidence","towns of Madang","health authorities","feature","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN","Albany"],"language":"en"},

This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used \u223C2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (\u223C80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual\u2019s home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic\u2019s final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.","publish_time":"2013-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo M.; Bisanzio, Donal; Stoddard, Steven T.; Paz-Soldan, Valerie; Morrison, Amy C.; Elder, John P.; Ramirez-Paredes, Jhon; Halsey, Eric S.; Kochel, Tadeusz J.; Scott, Thomas W.; Kitron, Uriel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91781004fcf2142034de62e1212be3d885139060.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3620113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3620113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iquitos","Peru"],"keyphrases":["Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns","predictable mobility routine","local mobility kernels","infectious disease dynamics","infectious disease threats","age-specific mobility parameters","burden of disease","unstructured routines","global urban population","infectious disease mitigation strategies","resource-poor urban center","resource-poor urban environments","scale patterns of individual movement","better urban planning","fine-scale","single location","individuals","city of Iquitos","need","unstructured daily routines","understanding","careful consideration of human social interactions","dynamic co-location networks","GPS data-points","data-loggers","role of fine","dynamics of transmission","structured contacts","Iquitos neighborhood","case study","tracked participants","social network structure","Global Positioning System","Potential hourly contacts","epidemic\u2019s final size","comparison","effective reproduction number","sharp contrast","time","light of rapid growth","basic rules","residents","rise","situation","mechanistic description","urbanization","pathogen","scenarios modeling","influenza","majority","impact","neighborhoods","countries","globalization","particular relevance","workplace","Geographic space","developed world","findings","Peru","individual\u2019s home","movements"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in renal tubules and has been shown to be renoprotective in diabetes. The protease, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, is involved in the ectodomain shedding of several transmembrane proteins including ACE2. Renal ACE2 and ADAM17 were significantly increased in db/db mice compared to controls. We investigated the effect of the insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, on albuminuria, renal ADAM17 protein expression and ACE2 shedding in db/db diabetic mice. Rosiglitazone treatment of db/db mice normalized hyperglycemia, attenuated renal injury and decreased urinary ACE2 and renal ADAM17 protein expression. Urinary excreted ACE2 is enzymatically active. Western blot analysis of urinary ACE2 demonstrated two prominent immunoreactive bands at approximately 70 \u0026 90 kDa. The predominant immunoreactive band is approximately 20 kDa shorter than the one demonstrated for kidney lysate, indicating possible ectodomain shedding of active renal ACE2 in the urine. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that renoprotection of rosiglitazone could be partially mediated via downregulation of renal ADAM17 and ACE2 shedding. In addition, there was a positive correlation between blood glucose, urinary albumin, plasma glucagon, and triglyceride levels with urinary ACE2 excretion. In conclusion, urinary ACE2 could be used as a sensitive biomarker of diabetic nephropathy and for monitoring the effectiveness of renoprotective medication.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chodavarapu, Harshita; Grobe, Nadja; Somineni, Hari K.; Salem, Esam S.

METHODS: The review of the literature followed PRISMA guidelines. We included studies of hospitalized children aged 0-4 years with confirmed ALRI published between 1995 and 2011. A total of 51 studies were included in the final review, comprising 56 091 hospitalized ALRI episodes. RESULTS: IV was detected in 3.0% (2.2%-4.0%) of all hospitalized ALRI cases, PIV in 2.7% (1.9%-3.7%), and AV in 5.8% (3.4%-9.1%). CV are technically difficult to culture, and they were detected in 4.8% of all hospitalized ALRI patients in one study. When respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and less common viruses were included, at least one virus was detected in 50.4% (40.0%-60.7%) of all hospitalized severe ALRI episodes. Moreover, 21.9% (17.7%-26.4%) of these viral ALRI were mixed, including more than one viral pathogen. Among all severe ALRI with confirmed viral etiology, IV accounted for 7.0% (5.5%-8.7%), PIV for 5.8% (4.1%-7.7%), and AV for 8.8% (5.3%-13.0%).

A mechanistic understanding of transmission is essential for characterizing the risk of emerging diseases and monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics. Thus methods for inferring [Image: see text] and the degree of heterogeneity in transmission from stuttering chain data have important applications in disease surveillance and management. Previous researchers have used chain size distributions to infer [Image: see text], but estimation of the degree of individual-level variation in infectiousness (as quantified by the dispersion parameter, [Image: see text]) has typically required contact tracing data. Utilizing branching process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to chain size data to infer both [Image: see text] and the dispersion parameter that characterizes heterogeneity. While the maximum likelihood value for [Image: see text] is a simple function of the average chain size, the associated confidence intervals are dependent on the inferred degree of transmission heterogeneity. As demonstrated for monkeypox data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this impacts when a statistically significant change in [Image: see text] is detectable. In addition, by allowing for superspreading events, inference of [Image: see text] shifts the threshold above which a transmission chain should be considered anomalously large for a given value of [Image: see text] (thus reducing the probability of false alarms about pathogen adaptation). Our analysis of monkeypox also clarifies the various ways that imperfect observation can impact inference of transmission parameters, and highlights the need to quantitatively evaluate whether observation is likely to significantly bias results.","publish_time":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blumberg, Seth; Lloyd-Smith, James O.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/104905bcc37d4afad386adaeed57fbe4fc73a595.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3642075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3642075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Democratic Republic"],"keyphrases":["Image","text","chain size data","stuttering chain data","inferred degree of transmission heterogeneity","average chain size","chain size distributions","inference of transmission parameters","degree of heterogeneity","monkeypox data","mechanistic understanding of transmission","self-limited stuttering transmission chains","degree of individual","contact tracing data","maximum likelihood value","maximum likelihood estimation","dispersion parameter","risk of emerging diseases","emerging zoonoses","imperfect observation","disease surveillance","given value","analysis of monkeypox","vaccine-preventable diseases","infectious disease processes","important applications","associated confidence intervals","infections","negative binomial offspring distribution","monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics","impacts","various ways","simple function","Democratic Republic of Congo","probability of false alarms","pathogen adaptation","branching process theory","infectiousness","management","level variation","superspreading events","Previous researchers","significant change","bias results","need","inferring","threshold","addition","methods"],"language":"en"},

Participants include 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living and 61 age- and sex-matched non-caregivers. A single-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was given to all subjects by intramuscular ingestion. Blood samples were collected before vaccination, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks after vaccination. Influenza vaccine strain-specific antibody titers were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition method. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed for ratios and absolute counts, and cytokine concentration were measured by flow cytometry. Validated scales were used to assess psychological (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and caregiver strain), social (multidimensional social support scale), and lifestyle factors (physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) at baseline prior to vaccination. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were also collected. Albumin levels were measured as an indicator for nutritional status in subjects. Caregivers had statistically significant (p \u003C 0.05) lower cell-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination at 12 weeks when compared with those of the controls. No differences in humoral immune response to vaccination were observed between caregivers and controls. Hong Kong Chinese elderly who experience chronic stress have a significantly lower cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination when compared with non-caregivers.","publish_time":"2012-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Wong, Chun Kwok; Chan, Frank Wan Kin; Chan, Paul K.

Our contemporary political order is, in part, characterized by sovereign states acting either in opposition or cooperation with other sovereign states. This order is also characterized by transnational efforts to address transnational issues such as those featured so prominently in the area of global health, such as the spread of infectious disease, health worker migration and the movement of health-harming products. These two features of the current order understandably create tension for truly global initiatives. DISCUSSION: National security has become the dominant ethical frame underlying the health-based foreign policy of many states, despite the transnational nature of many contemporary health challenges. This ethical approach engages global health as a means to achieving national security objectives. Implicit in this ethical frame is the version of humanity that dichotomizes between \u201Cus\u201D and \u201Cthem\u201D. What has been left out of this discourse, for the most part, is the role that foreign policy can play in extending the responsibility of states to protect and promote health of the other, for the sake of the other. SUMMARY: The principal purpose of this paper is to review arguments for a cosmopolitan ethics of health-based foreign policy. I will argue that health-based foreign policy that is motivated by security interests is lacking both morally and practically to further global health goals. In other words, a cosmopolitan ethic is not only intrinsically superior as a moral ideal, but also has potential to contribute to utilitarian ends. This paper draws on the cosmopolitanism literature to build robust support for foreign policies that contribute to sustainable systems of global health governance.","publish_time":"2013-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lencucha, Raphael","journal":"BMC Int Health Hum Rights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8b5534e592f2bb4dd5eaa6e6adaaffd7fbfd18a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3717113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["movement of health","area of global health","global health goals","Foreign policy","cosmopolitan ethics of health","contemporary health challenges","health worker migration","sustainable systems of global health governance","foreign policies","global initiatives","global citizenship","sovereign states","responsibility of states","dominant ethical frame","transnational nature","transnational efforts","ethical approach","transnational issues","national security objectives","security interests","current order","contemporary political order","paper","great potential","means","spread of infectious disease","robust support","opposition","cosmopolitanism literature","tension","cooperation","arguments","BACKGROUND","principal purpose","version of humanity","SUMMARY","words","utilitarian ends","features","DISCUSSION","products","role","discourse","sake"],"language":"en"},

As docking ambitions grow to include new scoring function terms, and to address ever more targets, the reliability and extendability of the orientation sampling, and the throughput of the method, become pressing. Here we explore sampling techniques that eliminate stochastic behavior in DOCK3.6, allowing us to optimize the method for regularly variable sampling of orientations. This also enabled a focused effort to optimize the code for efficiency, with a three-fold increase in the speed of the program. This, in turn, facilitated extensive testing of the method on the 102 targets, 22,805 ligands and 1,411,214 decoys of the Directory of Useful Decoys - Enhanced (DUD-E) benchmarking set, at multiple levels of sampling. Encouragingly, we observe that as sampling increases from 50 to 500 to 2000 to 5000 to 20000 molecular orientations in the binding site (and so from about 1\u00D710(10) to 4\u00D710(10) to 1\u00D710(11) to 2\u00D710(11) to 5\u00D710(11) mean atoms scored per target, since multiple conformations are sampled per orientation), the enrichment of ligands over decoys monotonically increases for most DUD-E targets.

In this study, blood samples taken from 111 dogs, which were admitted to the Internal Medicine Clinic of Selcuk University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, with clinical symptoms. Seventy-seven dogs were sampled from Isparta and Burdur dog shelters by random sampling, regardless of the clinical findings. Dogs showed a systemic disease, characterized by fever, diarrhea, vomiting, oculonasal discharge, conjunctivitis, severe moist cough, signs of pulmonary disease and dehydration. Two dogs had corneal opacity and photophobia. In serological studies, 188 serum samples were investigated on the presence of CAV antibodies by ELISA. Total 103 (103/188\u201354.7%) blood samples were detected to be positive for CAV antibodies by ELISA. However, 85 (85/188\u201345.2%) blood samples were negative.

However, criteria to decide when to conduct contact tracing are not well established. We have investigated the available evidence for contact tracing with a focus on public ground transport aiming to give guidance in what situations contact tracing should be considered. METHODS: Relevant infectious diseases suitable for contact tracing in ground transport and a set of disease-specific epidemiological criteria were defined through literature search and structured multistep expert consultations. We developed continuous scales for each criterion to be rated for its relevance to contact tracing in ground transport. We used the Delphi method with an international expert panel to position the values of criteria on the respective scales. RESULTS: The study led to the development of the \u2018Contact Tracing-Risk Assessment Profile\u2019 (CT-RAP), a decision-making instrument, taking into account pathogen-specific as well as situation-specific criteria. This report describes the methodology of this instrument and presents two examples of ready-to-use CT-RAP for tuberculosis and for meningococcal disease in public ground transport. DISCUSSION: The systematic and transparent use of the CT-RAP for tuberculosis and meningococcal disease is likely to facilitate reasonable, efficient and user-friendly decisions with respect to contact tracing. New CT-RAPs for additional pathogens and different settings such as schools and kindergartens are being planned.","publish_time":"2013-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohr, Oliver; Hermes, Julia; Schink, Susanne B; Askar, Mona; Menucci, Daniel; Swaan, Corien; Goetsch, Udo; Monk, Philip; Eckmanns, Tim; Poggensee, Gabriele; Krause, G\u00E9rard","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65d508add328dceec3427a9bc54cff552b6a2271.json; document_parses/pdf_json/319017db7033f2754fd403feb01c1fa2b26f38cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3808761.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3808761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tracing persons","Contact Tracing-Risk Assessment Profile","public ground transport","specific epidemiological criteria","situation-specific criteria","meningococcal disease","values of criteria","set of disease","tuberculosis","New CT-RAPs","account pathogen-specific","Relevant infectious diseases suitable","decision-making instrument","infectious patient","transparent use","respective scales","continuous scales","international expert panel","spread of communicable diseases","structured multistep expert consultations","literature search","additional pathogens","different settings","focus","user-friendly decisions","guidance","schools","Delphi method","METHODS","relevance","available evidence","kindergartens","criterion","DISCUSSION","development","examples of ready","study","report","methodology","BACKGROUND","situations","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The re-emergence of CHIKV has resulted in numerous outbreaks in the eastern hemisphere, and threatens to expand in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available. The present study reports the use of resazurin in a cell-based high-throughput assay, and an image-based high-content assay to identify and characterize inhibitors of CHIKV-infection in vitro. CHIKV is a highly cytopathic virus that rapidly kills infected cells. Thus, cell viability of HuH-7 cells infected with CHIKV in the presence of compounds was determined by measuring metabolic reduction of resazurin to identify inhibitors of CHIKV-associated cell death. A kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 compounds was screened against CHIKV infection of HuH-7 cells using the resazurin reduction assay, and the cell toxicity was also measured in non-infected cells. Seventy-two compounds showing \u226550% inhibition property against CHIKV at 10 \u00B5M were selected as primary hits. Four compounds having a benzofuran core scaffold (CND0335, CND0364, CND0366 and CND0415), one pyrrolopyridine (CND0545) and one thiazol-carboxamide (CND3514) inhibited CHIKV-associated cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with EC(50) values between 2.2 \u00B5M and 7.1 \u00B5M. Based on image analysis, these 6 hit compounds did not inhibit CHIKV replication in the host cell. However, CHIKV-infected cells manifested less prominent apoptotic blebs typical of CHIKV cytopathic effect compared with the control infection. Moreover, treatment with these compounds reduced viral titers in the medium of CHIKV-infected cells by up to 100-fold. In conclusion, this cell-based high-throughput screening assay using resazurin, combined with the image-based high content assay approach identified compounds against CHIKV having a novel antiviral activity - inhibition of virus-induced CPE - likely by targeting kinases involved in apoptosis.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Deu John M.; Bonotto, Rafaela M.; Gomes, Rafael G.

By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy. Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation.

Here we comprehensively map variation in HNF1B with respect to epithelial ovarian cancer risk and analyse DNA methylation and expression profiles across histological subtypes. Different single-nucleotide polymorphisms associate with invasive serous (rs7405776 odds ratio (OR)=1.13, P=3.1 \u00D7 10(\u221210)) and clear cell (rs11651755 OR=0.77, P=1.6 \u00D7 10(\u22128)) epithelial ovarian cancer. Risk alleles for the serous subtype associate with higher HNF1B-promoter methylation in these tumours. Unmethylated, expressed HNF1B, primarily present in clear cell tumours, coincides with a CpG island methylator phenotype affecting numerous other promoters throughout the genome. Different variants in HNF1B associate with risk of serous and clear cell epithelial ovarian cancer; DNA methylation and expression patterns are also notably distinct between these subtypes.

Oral administration of NPM-9 in mice reduced ear thickness and specific IgE production in trimellitic anhydride- (TMA-)induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS). NPM-9 also suppressed IL-4 and IL-1\u03B2 production in splenocytes but prevented only TMA-induced IL-1\u03B2 production in inflamed ears. To characterize the mechanism of this effect, we examined NPM-9 immunosuppression on an OVA-induced Th2 allergic state. Oral administration of NPM-9 inhibited Th2-mediated serum IgE overproduction.

The combined effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Ang II on cardiomyocytes is unknown. The present study was designed to determine the effect of HGF on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured in vitro. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 \u00B5M) alone, HGF (10 ng/mL) alone, and Ang II (1 \u00B5M) plus HGF (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The amount of [(3)H]-leucine incorporation was then measured to evaluate protein synthesis. The mRNA levels of \u03B2-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor were determined by real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was also studied. Ang II (1 \u00B5M) increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Similar to Ang II, treatment with 1 \u00B5M HGF promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the combination of 1 \u00B5M Ang II and 10 ng/mL HGF clearly induced a combined pro-hypertrophy effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study demonstrates for the first time a novel, combined effect of HGF and Ang II in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","publish_time":"2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ai-Lan; Ou, Cai-Wen; He, Zhao-Chu; Liu, Qi-Cai; Dong, Qi; Chen, Min-Sheng","journal":"Braz J Med Biol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30d2d2d37c2a884db55ab21d1cbd92abcff95fa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3854218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3854218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["HGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5M Ang","\u00B5M HGF","cardiomyocyte hypertrophy","combined effect of HGF","combined pro-hypertrophy effect","combined effect of hepatocyte growth factor","Primary cardiomyocytes","cell size of cardiomyocytes","present study","atrial natriuretic factor","myosin heavy chain","mRNA levels of \u03B2","real-time PCR","presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression","treatment","novel","important role","neonatal rat hearts","leucine incorporation","combination","protein synthesis","Angiotensin","Cells"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-\u03B1 supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-\u03BAB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-\u03B1 responses.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belnoue, Elodie; Fontannaz, Paola; Rochat, Anne-Fran\u00E7oise; Tougne, Chantal; Bergthaler, Andreas; Lambert, Paul-Henri; Pinschewer, Daniel D.; Siegrist, Claire-Anne","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/871bb1d475d0dbb910cce25e16d066adf9706a4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3871569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871569/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infant pDC responses","early life viral infections","infant mice","LCMV infection","early life microenvironment","IFN responses","immediate-early IFN-\u03B1 responses","limited early type","impaired early life T cell responses","adult mice","control infection","infant animals","Infant mortality","pDC functions","coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation","viral control result","TLR7 viral sensor","acute self-limiting infection","T cells","activation capacity of infant pDCs","persistent viral replication","pDC master regulator","IFN-\u03B1 supplementation","acute infections","LCMV-specific CD8","limited T cell-mediated defense","major source of immediate","severe course","protracted course","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","major global health concern","MyD88","viruses","model ligand","critical downstream antiviral genes","NF-\u03BAB","TLR9","E2","mature hosts","expression","incentives","ssRNA polyU","novel strategies","IRF8","IRF7","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","baseline","IFNs","similar pattern","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

In two studies, we explored how lay decisionmakers varying in numeracy evaluated and used likelihood assessments and narrative evidence in forecasts. Overall, the less numerate reported higher risk and likelihood perceptions. In simple probabilistic forecasts without narrative evidence, decisionmakers at all levels of numeracy were able to use the stated likelihood information, although risk perceptions of the less numerate were more affected by likelihood format. When a forecast includes narrative evidence, decisionmakers were better able to use stated likelihood in a percentage as compared to frequency or verbal formats. The more numerate used stated likelihood more in their evaluations whereas the less numerate focused more on the narrative evidence. These results have important implications for risk analysts and forecasters who need to report the results of their analyses to decisionmakers.

Intestinal infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis, particularly of serotype III, was found to be especially prevalent in weaned calves, yearlings and young adult cattle. Clinically affected cattle had a profuse liquid diarrhoea and many were systemically ill. Haematological changes suggestive of infection were present in 38 of 49 of these cattle. At least 35 cattle died and characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 20 of 26 examined histologically. Y. pseudotuberculosis was sensitive to tetracyclines in vitro and this drug produced a rapid bacteriological cure. Yersiniosis occurred during the winter, spring and early summer. Challenge of adult cattle with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III did not result in intestinal colonisation or clinical disease. Intestinal infection was, however, established in 4 weaned calves and haematological changes and antibody production were demonstrated in them. Intestinal microabscesses were seen in three calves killed on days 8, 14 and 18 after challenge. The fourth calf eliminated infection by day 18 and no lesions were demonstrated when it was killed on day 72. There is a very high prevalence of antibodies reacting with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III in adult cattle. It is concluded that cattle are a common host for this bacterium, infection being frequent, with clinical and fatal disease occurring occasionally. The factors leading to clinical disease are unknown.","publish_time":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"SLEE, KJ; BRIGHTLING, P; SEILER, RJ","journal":"Aust Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a01ff426d36471a472458be124d10ba4e27ad6e4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gippsland"],"keyphrases":["Intestinal infection","scouring cattle","Challenge of adult cattle","young adult cattle","Intestinal microabscesses","intestinal tract","pseudotuberculosis serotype","intestinal colonisation","intestinal mucosa","clinical disease","weaned calves","Haematological changes suggestive of infection","fatal disease","characteristic microabscesses","yearlings","drug","Yersinia sp","antibody production","winter","spring","bacterium","common host","profuse liquid diarrhoea","selective medium","early summer","rapid bacteriological cure","high prevalence of antibodies","tetracyclines","Gippsland","factors","SUMMARY","Yersiniosis","days","calf","lesions"],"language":"en"},

In the present paper, early risk factors for later lung function abnormalities and for bronchial hyper\u2010responsiveness (BHR) were evaluated in 81 children, hospitalized for bronchiolitis in infancy, at the median age of 12.3 years. Methods: The basic data, including data on atopy in children and viral aetiology of bronchiolitis, had been collected on entry to the study at less than 2 years of age. Lung function was studied by flow\u2010volume spirometry (FVS), and BHR by methacholine and exercise challenge tests 11.4 years after hospitalization during infancy.

Results The overall cost to the Queensland dairy industry of the cattle tick (excluding the costs associated specifically with tick fever) and based on 1998 management practices, was $4,096,000 per annum.

One particular sialic acid called N\u2010glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is widely expressed on most mammalian tissues, but is not easily detectable on human cells. In fact, it provokes an immune response in adult humans. The human deficiency of Neu5Gc is explained by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding CMP\u2010N\u2010acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the rate\u2010limiting enzyme in generating Neu5Gc in cells of other mammals. This deficiency also results in an excess of the precursor sialic acid N\u2010acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in humans. This mutation appears universal to modern humans, occurred sometime after our last common ancestor with the great apes, and happens to be one of the first known human\u2010great ape genetic differences with an obvious biochemical readout. While the original selection mechanisms and major biological consequences of this human\u2010specific mutation remain uncertain, several interesting clues are currently being pursued. First, there is evidence that the human condition can explain differences in susceptibility or resistance to certain microbial pathogens. Second, the functions of some endogenous receptors for sialic acids in the immune system may be altered by this difference. Third, despite the lack of any obvious alternate pathway for synthesis, Neu5Gc has been reported in human tumors and possibly in human fetal tissues, and traces have even been detected in normal human tissues. One possible explanation is that this represents accumulation of Neu5Gc from dietary sources of animal origin. Finally, a markedly reduced expression of hydroxylase in the brains of other mammals raises the possibility that the human\u2010specific mutation of this enzyme could have played a role in human brain evolution.

One gap in this knowledge concerns respiratory tract pathogens transmitted from person to person by direct contact or through environmental contamination. The sit\u2010and\u2010wait hypothesis predicts that virulence should be positively correlated with durability in the external environment because high durability reduces the dependence of transmission on host mobility. Reviewing the epidemiological and medical literature, we confirm this prediction for respiratory tract pathogens of humans. Our results clearly distinguish a high\u2010virulence high\u2010survival group of variola (smallpox) virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza virus (where all pathogens have a mean percent mortality 0.01% and mean survival time \u003E10 days) from a low\u2010virulence low\u2010survival group containing ten other pathogens. The correlation between virulence and durability explains three to four times of magnitude of difference in mean percent mortality and mean survival time, using both across\u2010species and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Our findings bear on several areas of active research and public health policy: (1) many pathogens used in the biological control of insects are potential sit\u2010and\u2010wait pathogens as they combine three attributes that are advantageous for pest control: high virulence, long durability after application, and host specificity; (2) emerging pathogens such as the\u2018hospital superbug\u2019methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potential bioweapons pathogens such as smallpox virus and anthrax that are particularly dangerous can be discerned by quantifying their durability; (3) hospital settings and the AIDS pandemic may provide footholds for emerging sit\u2010and\u2010wait pathogens; and (4) studies on food\u2010borne and insect pathogens point to future research considering the potential evolutionary trade\u2010offs and genetic linkages between virulence and durability.","publish_time":"2007-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walther, Bruno A.; Ewald, Paul W.","journal":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63e08438ebd7d4435bd9fad69156663a7a6cc0c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging pathogens","insect pathogens","virulence high","high virulence","high durability","potential bioweapons pathogens","virulence low","respiratory tract pathogens of humans","long durability","mean survival time","knowledge concerns respiratory tract pathogens","mean percent mortality","potential sit","smallpox virus","emerging sit","survival group of variola","person","potential evolutionary trade\u2010offs","influenza virus","pest control","future research","hospital superbug\u2019methicillin","evolutionary explanations","hospital settings","host specificity","host mobility","Recent studies","areas of active research","biological control of insects","Corynebacterium diphtheriae","Bordetella pertussis","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","MRSA","Streptococcus pneumoniae","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","variation","prediction","difference","genetic linkages","application","AIDS pandemic","dependence of transmission","public health policy","direct contact","days","times of magnitude","external environment","human infectious diseases","gap","footholds","attributes","anthrax","environmental contamination","medical literature","species","food","controlled analyses","findings","hypothesis","results","correlation"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the effect generalizes beyond a college student sample, and preference construction differs by numeracy. Contrary to prior thinking about preference construction, however, high expertise and high ability (rather than low) consistently related to the paradoxical phenomenon. Results across studies including Study 3\u0027s experimental modifications of the task supported the hypothesized number comparison process (and not a lack of expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities or numeracy\u2010related differences in attention to numbers) as the effect\u0027s underlying cause.

In the present paper, we develop a shorter, psychometrically improved measure of numeracy\u2014the ability to understand, manipulate, and use numerical information, including probabilities. Across two large independent samples that varied widely in age and educational level, participants completed 18 items from existing numeracy measures. In Study 1, we conducted a Rasch analysis on the item pool and created an eight\u2010item numeracy scale that assesses a broader range of difficulty than previous scales. In Study 2, we replicated this eight\u2010item scale in a separate Rasch analysis using data from an independent sample. We also found that the new Rasch\u2010based numeracy scale, compared with previous measures, could predict decision\u2010making preferences obtained in past studies, supporting its predictive validity. In Study, 3, we further established the predictive validity of the Rasch\u2010based numeracy scale. Specifically, we examined the associations between numeracy and risk judgments, compared with previous scales. Overall, we found that the Rasch\u2010based scale was a better linear predictor of risk judgments than prior measures. Moreover, this study is the first to present the psychometric properties of several popular numeracy measures across a diverse sample of ages and educational level. We discuss the usefulness and the advantages of the new scale, which we feel can be used in a wide range of subject populations, allowing for a more clear understanding of how numeracy is associated with decision processes.

Two replicate experiments on rats were performed to determine if similar changes could be detected in animals exposed under a comparable regime, which was based on average, induced\u2010current densities and on the chronology of reproductive development, as dosimetrically and biologically scaled. Beginning at three months of age, female rats of the F(0) generation and their subsequent offspring were chronically exposed to a 60\u2010Hz electric field (100 kV/ m unperturbed) for 19 h/day for the duration of experimentation. After four weeks of exposure, F(0) female rats were mated to unexposed male rats during the field\u2010off period. No significant developmental effects were detected in their litters, confirming our previous results with swine and rats. The F(0) females were mated for a second time at 7.2 months of age, and the fetuses were evaluated shortly before term. In the first experiments, the incidence of intrauterine mortality was significantly less in exposed than in sham\u2010exposed litters, and there was a tendency (P = 0.12) for an increased incidence of malformed fetuses in exposed litters. Neither end point was significantly affected in the second experiment. Copulatory behavior of the female F(1) offspring, which were bred at three months of age, was not affected in either experiment. There was a statistically significant decrease in the fertility of F(1) exposed females and a significant increase in the fraction of exposed litters with malformed fetuses in the first experiment; both end points were essentially the same in the sham and exposed groups of the second experiment. That the significant effects detected in the first experiment were not seen in the second may be attributed to random or biological variation. Alternatively, the finding may indicate that the response threshold for induction of malformations lies near 100 kV/m.","publish_time":"2005-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rommereim, D. N.; Kaune, W.

The impact of SARS on colorectal surgery, particularly service provision and training, is unknown. This paper reports these changes from a single colorectal unit at the centre of the outbreak. Patients and methods Hospital databases and electronic patient records covering the 4 months duration of the SARS epidemic and an equivalent period preceding SARS were compared. Data was collected for inpatient admissions, outpatient consultations, operative surgery, colonoscopy and waiting times for appointments or surgery. Results The SARS epidemic resulted in reductions of 52% for new outpatient attendances, 59% for review attendances, 51% for admissions, 32% for surgical procedures and 48% for colonoscopies. Major emergency procedures, cancer resections and complex major procedures were unaffected. Operative procedures by trainees reduced by 48% and procedures by specialists reduced by 21%. Patients awaiting early or urgent outpatient appointments rose by 200% with waiting times for colonoscopy increased by a median 3, 5 or 9 weeks for outpatient, inpatient or non\u2010urgent cases, respectively. The waiting time for minor elective colorectal surgery was extended by 5 months. Conclusion SARS resulted in a major reduction in the colorectal surgical caseload. The consequences were evidenced by a detrimental effect on waiting times and colorectal training. However, serious pathology requiring emergency or complex surgery was still possible within these constraints.","publish_time":"2004-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradford, I. M.

It has been reported that peptides that contain asparagine\u2010glycine\u2010arginine (NGR) sequence home to APN in tumor vasculature. Increased expression of APN in tumor vascular endothelium, therefore, offers an opportunity to target NGR peptide\u2010linked therapeutic reagents to tumors. METHODS: To determine whether an additional NGR sequence could improve endothelial homing and biologic activity, human endostatin was modified genetically to introduce an NGR motif (NGR\u2010endostatin) and was expressed in yeast. In vitro biologic activity of NGR\u2010endostatin was compared with the native protein in endothelial cell proliferation and migration. NGR\u2010modified endostatin was used in tumor localization studies. Finally, the effects of endostatin and NGR\u2010endostatin on tumor growth were determined in two model systems. RESULTS: Human endostatin has an internal NGR sequence, which is not accessible to bind APN. However, the addition of an NGR\u2010sequence at the amino terminus resulted in strong binding and inhibition of endothelial cell APN. NGR\u2010endostatin showed increased binding to endothelial cells compared with the native protein. Increased binding of endostatin also coincided with improved antiangiogenic properties of endostatin. NGR modification improved tumor localization and, as a consequence, effectively inhibited ovarian carcinoma growth in athymic nude mice.

Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission\u2014that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases\u2014and are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting software package while investigating the features of each approach that contribute to good or poor performance. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay.

In this study, we have used an in vitro translation system in an attempt to characterize the molecular nature of the protein encoded by the 3\u2032 ORF of Mtv\u20108. Using various constructs encoding full\u2010length and truncated versions of the ORF product, we report that the hydrophobic region close to the amino terminus of the 36\u2010kDa protein can function as a transmembrane domain. Protease digestion experiments also demonstrate that the protein has a type\u2010II transmembrane conformation with an extra\u2010cytoplasmic carboxy terminus. Since this hydrophobic region is conserved between all known MMTV, we speculate that LTR ORF, including those proposed to encode the minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigens, are also capable of encoding type\u2010II transmembrane glycoproteins.

Recently, published literature examining wildlife response to fire and fire management has increased rapidly. However, none of this literature has been synthesized quantitatively, precluding assessment of consistent patterns of wildlife response among treatment types. Using meta\u2010analysis, we examined the scientific literature on vertebrate demographic responses to burn severity (low/moderate, high), fire surrogates (forest thinning), and fire and fire surrogate combined treatments in the most extensively studied fire\u2010prone, forested biome (forests of the United States). Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species\u2010by\u2010treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small\u2010mammal species that examined short\u2010term responses (\u22644 years) to thinning, low/moderate\u2010 and high\u2010severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale (\u003C50 ha), thinning and low/moderate\u2010severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High\u2010severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest\u2010thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate\u2010severity fire, whereas low/moderate\u2010severity fire is not a substitute for high\u2010severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire\u2010based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire\u2010sensitive taxa.

As these are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system using risk\u2010based interventions was proposed. Further studies are required on T. gondii and pathogenic VTEC. If new information confirms these hazards as a high risk to public health from meat from sheep or goats, setting targets at carcass level should be considered. Other elements of the system are risk\u2010categorisation of flocks/herds based on improved Food Chain Information (FCI), classification of abattoirs according to their capability to reduce faecal contamination, and use of improved process hygiene criteria. It is proposed to omit palpation and incision from post\u2010mortem inspection in animals subjected to routine slaughter. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin\u2010like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account FCI, which should be expanded to reflect the extensive production systems used, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control plans, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for tuberculosis and fasciolosis at animal level. Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse in small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available.

Ongoing monitoring and management of the biodiversity in those reserves is an equally important, but often neglected or poorly executed, part of the conservation process. In this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program \u2013 deciding what to monitor. We present a strategy for prioritizing species for monitoring and management in multispecies conservation plans. We use existing assessments of threatened status, and the degree and spatial and temporal extent of known threats to link the prioritization of species to the overarching goals and objectives of the conservation plan. We consider both broad and localized spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints. Spatial scales that are commensurate with available data are selected. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA. We use the prioritization to identify the most prominent risk factors and the habitats associated with the most threats to species. The protocol highlighted priorities that had not previously been identified and were not necessarily intuitive without systematic application of the criteria; many high\u2010priority species have received no monitoring attention to date, and lower\u2010priority species have. We recommend that in the absence of clear focal species, monitoring threats in highly impacted habitats may be a way to circumvent the need to monitor all the targeted species.","publish_time":"2007-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regan, Helen M.; Hierl, Lauren A.; Franklin, Janet; Deutschman, Douglas H.; Schmalbach, Heather L.; Winchell, Clark S.; Johnson, Brenda S.","journal":"Divers Distrib","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/536cc74cf664ee7a7be2785a4cae3fd03447a30f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c8f9c1b066f06fcad8d6257e136a4a27e45ae858.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["priority species","prioritization of species","prioritizing species","targeted species","monitoring attention","monitoring constraints","conservation process","monitoring program","Ongoing monitoring","multispecies conservation plans","Successful conservation plans","established multispecies conservation plan","regional conservation context","absence of clear focal species","localized spatial scales","strategy","practicalities of local management","temporal extent of known threats","systematic application","impacted habitats","important steps","designed reserves","San Diego County","criteria","animals","overarching goals","California","degree","plants","date","objectives","USA","set","biodiversity","existing assessments of threatened status","prominent risk factors","available data","way","need","utility","protocol","priorities","paper"],"language":"en"},

High levels of expression can disrupt cellular growth control and are associated with human cancers. A fraction of the cellular eIF4E is found in the nucleus where it may play a role in the transport of certain mRNAs to the cytoplasm. eIF4E undergoes regulated phosphorylation (at Ser209) by members of the Mnk group of kinases, which are activated by multiple MAP kinases (hence Mnk = MAP\u2010kinase signal integrating kinase). The functional significance of its phosphorylation has been the subject of considerable interest. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila point to a key role for phosphorylation of eIF4E in growth and viability. Initial structural data suggested that phosphorylation of Ser209 might allow formation of a salt bridge with a basic residue (Lys159) that would clamp eIF4E onto the mRNA and increase its affinity for ligand. However, more recent structural data place Ser209 too far away from Lys159 to form such an interaction, and biophysical studies indicate that phosphorylation actually decreases the affinity of eIF4E for cap or capped RNA. The implications of these studies are discussed in the light of other, in vitro and in vivo, investigations designed to address the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in mRNA translation or its control.","publish_time":"2002-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheper, Gert C.; Proud, Christopher G.","journal":"Eur J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bec7b113c13fb58fa2e8369d583fcc367c3b9b9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phosphorylation of eIF4E","role of eIF4E phosphorylation","cellular eIF4E","affinity of eIF4E","phosphorylation of Ser209","mRNA translation","regulated phosphorylation","key role","important role","translation factors","recent structural data place Ser209","binding proteins","cellular growth control","Recent genetic studies","Lys159","biophysical studies","multiple MAP kinases","Mnk group of kinases","Initial structural data","repressor proteins","kinase signal","cap structure","Drosophila point","salt bridge","members","scaffold protein eIF4G","basic residue","transport of certain mRNAs","High levels of expression","Eukaryotic initiation factor","formation","S ribosomal subunit","capped RNA","cytoplasm","interaction","nucleus","recruitment","viability","human cancers","functional significance","subject of considerable","ligand","fraction","implications","light","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The hypothesis is based in part on the abundant epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence of an association of infectious agents with autoimmune disease and observed cross\u2010reactivity of immune reagents with host \u2018self\u2019 antigens and microbial determinants. For our purpose, molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the molecules\u0027 linear amino acid sequences or their conformational fits may be shared, even though their origins are as separate as, for example, a virus and a normal host\u2013self determinant. An immune response against the determinant shared by the host and virus can evoke a tissue\u2010specific immune response that is presumably capable of eliciting cell and tissue destruction. The probable mechanism is generation of cytotoxic cross\u2010reactive effector lymphocytes or antibodies that recognize specific determinants on target cells. The induction of cross\u2010reactivity does not require a replicating agent, and immune\u2010mediated injury can occur after the immunogen has been removed\u2014a hit\u2010and\u2010run event. Hence, the viral or microbial infection that initiates the autoimmune phenomenon may not be present by the time overt disease develops. By a complementary mechanism, the microbe can induce cellular injury and release self antigens, which generate immune responses that cross\u2010react with additional but genetically distinct self antigens. In both scenarios, analysis of the T cells or antibodies specifically engaged in the autoimmune response and disease provides a fingerprint for uncovering the initiating infectious agent.\u2014Oldstone, M.

However, the use of such data as an alarm signal is rarely considered consciously when planning programmes. The present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the infestation of Aedes aegypti, considering the data available in the Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey (LIRAa) for the city of Campina Grande, Para\u00EDba State in Brazil. METHODS: The global and local Moran\u02BCs indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods, using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation, placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant Moran\u02BCs index value (P \u003C 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information on infestation locations to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly for arbovirus prevention.

This salutary effect of a DI is proposed to be mediated, at least partially, by momentarily increasing the operating length of airway smooth muscle (ASM). Concerningly, this premise is largely derived from a growing body of in vitro studies investigating the effect of stretching ASM by different magnitudes on its contractility. The relevance of these in vitro findings remains uncertain, as the real range of strains ASM undergoes in vivo during a DI is somewhat elusive. In order to understand the regulation of ASM contractility by a DI and to infer on its putative contribution to the bronchodilator effect of a DI, it is imperative that in vitro studies incorporate levels of strains that are physiologically relevant. This review summarizes the methods that may be used in vivo in humans to estimate the strain experienced by ASM during a DI from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The strengths and limitations of each method, as well as the potential confounders, are also discussed. A rough estimated range of ASM strains is provided for the purpose of guiding future in vitro studies that aim at quantifying the regulatory effect of DI on ASM contractility. However, it is emphasized that, owing to the many limitations and confounders, more studies will be needed to reach conclusive statements.","publish_time":"2019-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boss\u00E9, Ynuk","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbec69c1792397404f2c3385429e3a79bf30406b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI","ASM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulatory effect of DI","studies","regulation of ASM contractility","real range of strains ASM","rough estimated range of ASM strains","bronchodilator effect","salutary effect","levels of strains","limitations","potential confounders","total lung capacity","functional residual capacity","FRC","maneuver","operating length of airway smooth muscle","great deal","purpose","different magnitudes","putative contribution","ability","findings","TLC","deep inspiration","growing body of","flow of air","premise","lungs","relevance","strengths","order","conclusive statements","review","methods","Concerningly","humans"],"language":"en"},

Objective The aim of this study was to compare the EVW and control groups from this study for inflammatory changes occurring in the upper and lower respiratory tracts during the experimental infection, in particular, to determine whether eosinophil\u2010driven inflammation was associated with EVW. Methods Nasal lavage and induced sputum were collected prior to inoculation (day 0) and 2, 4 and 17 days later. Differential cell counts were performed and supernatant was assayed for IL\u20108, IL\u20105, IFN\u2010\u03B3, and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP). Results There was no difference between the two groups in any measurement at baseline. In both groups, during colds the volume of nasal secretion increased as did leucocyte counts in both upper and lower respiratory tracts. A modest increase in nasal neutrophil count was seen in both EVW and control groups with symptomatic colds on day 2 (median (quartile) difference from baseline 5.4 (0.0, 11.0) and 1.8 (\u22121.1, 2.2)\u00D710(4)/mL of secretions, respectively). The change in nasal neutrophil counts in all subjects correlated with nasal symptom scores. A significant relative increase in sputum differential neutrophil count was seen on day 4 in the EVW group with a cold but not in controls (mean difference (95% confidence interval) 20.4 (9.6, 31.1)% and 3.1 (\u22128.2, 14.5)%, respectively, P\u003C0.01); however, this increase did not correlate with lower respiratory tract symptom scores. IL\u20108 increased in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts in both EVW and control subjects with colds, the largest change being seen on day 4 in the sputum of those with EVW (mean difference from baseline (95% confidence interval) 2.5 (0.55\u20134.46) ng/mL). Only modest changes were seen in IFN\u2010\u03B3 and no changes were seen in IL\u20105 or ECP. None of the results was influenced by the atopic status of the subjects in either group. Conclusions EVW wheeze is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts without eosinophilia (even in atopic subjects). IL\u20108 is likely to be an important chemokine in this process.

The most common tidal volume (TV) applied was 6\u20138 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) in scenarios 1\u20132 (72% PaO(2)/FIO(2) \u003E 300 and 61% PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150\u2013300) and 4\u20136 ml/kg/PBW in scenario 3 (53% PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003C 150). The most common level of highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) used was 15 cmH(2)O in patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u2264 300 without intracranial hypertension (41% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150\u2013300 and 50% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003C 150) and 10 cmH(2)O in patients with intracranial hypertension (32% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150\u2013300 and 33% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003C 150). Regardless of the presence of intracranial hypertension, the most common carbon dioxide target remained 36\u201340 mmHg whereas the most common PaO(2) target was 81\u2013100 mmHg in all the 3 scenarios. The most frequent rescue strategies utilized in case of refractory respiratory failure despite conventional ventilator settings were neuromuscular blocking agents [406 (88%)], recruitment manoeuvres [319 (69%)] and prone position [292 (63%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilatory management, targets and practice of adult severe TBI patients with and without respiratory failure are widely different among centres. These findings may be helpful to define future investigations in this topic.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Picetti, Edoardo; Pelosi, Paolo; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Citerio, Giuseppe; Mancebo, Jordi; Robba, Chiara","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d948ee20c9036f8bcd1dc27f518323f38a873d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI","European Society of Intensive Care Medicine","ESICM","PaO"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["FiO","common PaO","ventilatory management of TBI patients","practice of adult severe TBI patients","acute respiratory failure","case of refractory respiratory failure","presence of intracranial hypertension","different clinical scenarios","common carbon dioxide target","common tidal volume","ESICM","mmHg","PBW","cmH","respondents","Optimal ventilator strategies","common level of highest positive end-expiratory pressure","arterial partial pressure of oxygen","standard protocol","international survey","conventional ventilator settings","frequent rescue strategies","inspired fraction of oxygen","specific weaning protocol","Severe traumatic brain injury","targets","European Society of Intensive Care Medicine","neuromuscular blocking agents","PEEP","items","mechanical ventilation","website","BACKGROUND","predicted body weight","future investigations","electronic questionnaire","TV","CONCLUSIONS","centres","METHODS","findings","topic","intensivists","recruitment manoeuvres","prone position","RESULTS","anesthesiologists"],"language":"en"},

The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication, is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA, the frameshift stimulatory signal. The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure, present at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of all HIV-1 mRNAs. Depending upon its concentration, TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by TAR affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. CD4\u002B T cells and 293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the HIV-1 frameshift. Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR. A model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mRNA, which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal.","publish_time":"2007-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gendron, Karine; Charbonneau, Johanie; Dulude, Dominic; Heveker, Nikolaus; Ferbeyre, Gerardo; Brakier-Gingras, L\u00E9a","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c55e262b24b28cbd200cae613d6de88c35807deb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2248755.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2248755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TAR RNA","TAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV","rate of initiation","rate of translation initiation","ribosomal frameshift","dependent translation initiation","frameshift efficiency correlates","frameshift stimulatory signal","TAR RNA structure","changes","viral mRNA","T cells","reporter mRNA","rate of cap","PKR","specific structure","elongating ribosomes","firefly luciferase expression","dual-luciferase construct","double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase","distance","precursor","probability of frameshifting","Gag-","interaction","virus replication","enzymes","frequency of encounter","CD4","mRNAs","model","concentration"],"language":"en"},

During 2007, the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent HRV strains were reported. To catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent HRV strains, we undertook, for the first time, in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been detected. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Genomic analyses revealed that the six divergent strains, residing within a clade we previously called HRV A2, had the shortest polyprotein of all picornaviruses investigated. Structure-based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus Rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains. Deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as HRV and HEV receptor footprints. Because the HRV A2 strains cannot yet be cultured, we created homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins. In silico comparisons confirmed that HRV-QPM was most closely related to the major group HRVs. HRV-QPM was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen. It was the only virus detected in 65% of positive individuals. These observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe. CONCLUSIONS: The divergent strains did not meet classification requirements for any existing species of the genus Rhinovirus or Enterovirus. HRV A2 strains should be partitioned into at least one new species, putatively called Human rhinovirus C, populated by members detected with high frequency, from individuals with respiratory symptoms requiring hospital admission.","publish_time":"2008-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"McErlean, Peter; Shackelton, Laura A.; Andrews, Emily; Webster, Dale R.; Lambert, Stephen B.; Nissen, Michael D.; Sloots, Theo P.; Mackay, Ian M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00acd3fd31ed0cde8df286697caefc5298e54df1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2268738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2268738/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["divergent HRV strains","HRV A2 strains","divergent strains","detected pathogens","homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins","genus Rhinovirus","clinical impact of individual members","clinical features","silico analyses","structure","Human rhinovirus C","objective clinical impact ranging","available polyprotein sequences","respiratory symptoms","Genomic analyses","existing species","substantive deletions","shortest polyprotein","new species","hospital admission","Human rhinoviruses","silico comparisons","positive individuals","complete coding sequences","major group HRVs","acute respiratory tract infections","retrospective reviews","variants","conserved motifs","amino acid alignments","medical records of cases","infants","insertions unique","classification requirements","persistent cough","high frequency","prototype strain","expiratory wheezing","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPLE FINDINGS","ARTIs","recurrence","antigenicity","clade","affected regions","HEV receptor footprints","BACKGROUND","prevalence","observations","Enterovirus","supplemental oxygen","picornaviruses","time","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

To support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates, preclinical studies have been performed in mice or rabbits to determine where in the body these plasmid vaccines would biodistribute and how rapidly they would clear. In the course of these studies, it has been observed that regardless of the gene insert (expressing the vaccine immunogen or cytokine adjuvant) and regardless of the promoter used to drive expression of the gene insert in the plasmid backbone, the plasmid vaccines do not biodistribute widely and remain essentially in the site of injection, in the muscle and overlying subcutis.

Over the course of 2 months, the plasmid clears from the site of injection with only a small percentage of animals (generally 10\u221220%) retaining a small number of copies (generally around 100 copies) in the muscle at the injection site. This pattern of biodistribution (confined to the injection site) and clearance (within 2 months) is consistent regardless of differences in the promoter in the plasmid backbone or differences in the gene insert being expressed by the plasmid vaccine. In addition, integration has not been observed with plasmid vaccine candidates inoculated i.m. by Biojector 2000 or by needle and syringe. These data build on the repeated-dose toxicology studies performed (see companion article, Sheets et al., 2006) to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of DNA plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications.","publish_time":"2006-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheets, Rebecca L.; Stein, Judith; Manetz, T.

We aimed to develop a framework that will facilitate planning for general practice, and used it to appraise pandemic plans from Australia, England, USA, New Zealand and Canada. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We adapted the Haddon matrix to develop the framework, populating its cells through a multi-method study that incorporated the peer-reviewed and grey literature, interviews with general practitioners, practice nurses and senior decision-makers, and desktop simulation exercises. We used the framework to analyse 89 publicly-available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries. The framework identifies four functional domains: clinical care for influenza and other needs, public health responsibilities, the internal environment and the macro-environment of general practice. No plan addressed all four domains. Most plans either ignored or were sketchy about non-influenza clinical needs, and about the contribution of general practice to public health beyond surveillance. Collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans, and inter-relationships with the broader health system, even less frequently. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza. The framework helped identify critical shortcomings in available plans. Engaging general practice effectively in planning is challenging, particularly where governance structures for primary health care are weak.

Here we investigated the IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC- and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF-\u03B1 responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-\u03B1\u03B2R(\u2212/\u2212) mice, we show that IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 production induced by adenovirus in vivo.

To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 \u00C5 resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site.

The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 \u00B5g DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.","publish_time":"2008-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Srinivas; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Nason, Martha; Styles, Darrel; DeTolla, Louis J.; Sorrell, Erin M.; Song, Haichen; Wan, Hongquan; Ramirez-Nieto, Gloria C.; Perez, Daniel; Nabel, Gary J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef872b80cf38917f64c42bfa52a57beb4399897a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2657001.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of DNA vaccines","heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1","multiple strains of HPAI H5N1","trivalent HA vaccines","DNA immunization","lethal H5N1","different HPAI H5N1 serotypes","heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge","pathogenic avian influenza","\u00B5g DNA","influenza virus HA","avian species","chickens","evolving avian influenza viruses","trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine","different strains","avian disease","influenza virus immunization applicable","major concern of current vaccines","mice","vaccination","intramuscular needle injection","needle-free device","egg-based vaccine production","multiple animal species","pressure injection device","rapid adaptation","conferred protection","neutralizing antibodies","evolving field isolates","doses","generic approach","proteins","capacity","plasmids","syringe","inability","hemagglutinin","risk of reassortment","potency","Sustained outbreaks","Vietnam","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","threat","help","choice","SIGNIFICANCE","dose-dependent","breadth","BACKGROUND","humans","METHODOLOGY","weeks","spread","potential","CONCLUSIONS","response","addition","combinations"],"language":"en"},

Recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples. A rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify HIV-1 from DBS is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have developed a real-time LightCycler (rtLC) PCR assay to detect and quantify HIV-1 from DBS. HIV-1 RNA extracted from DBS was amplified in a one-step, single-tube system using primers specific for long-terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all HIV-1 clades. SYBR Green dye was used to quantify PCR amplicons and HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of HIV-1 RNA. This assay detected samples across clades, has a dynamic range of 5 log(10), and %CV \u003C8% up to 4 log(10) dilution. Plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the Roche Ultrasensitive (r = 0.91) and branched DNA (r = 0.89) assays. The lower limit of detection (95%) was estimated to be 136 copies. The rtLC DBS assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays. Adaptation of the assay into other real-time systems demonstrated similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy, reliability, genotype inclusivity and affordability, along with the small volumes of blood required for the assay suggest that the rtLC DBS assay will be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric HIV-1 infection in resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Nishaki; Trzmielina, Sonia; Nonyane, Bareng A.

Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln(269)-Arg(277)) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160(gag-pol) mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion.

The last 10 years have witnessed explosive progress in elucidation of the biochemistry of chloroquine resistance. This review briefly summarizes that progress, and discusses where additional work is needed.","publish_time":"2009-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roepe, Paul D","journal":"Future Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d877bf7b0f61b89204e1b66028983939f93aaf8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2724744.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug susceptibility","quinoline drug structure","drug-resistant malarial parasites","cellular drug accumulation","years","chloroquine-resistant malaria","quinoline drugs","additional modifications","explosive progress","additional work","power of malarial genetics","biochemistry of chloroquine resistance","elucidation","activity","order","pfcrt gene","infancy","key target","parasite cell culture methods","decades","discovery","assays","catabolized hemoglobin","Heme","laboratories"],"language":"en"},

Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P\u003C0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1. The TCAD regimen overcomes baseline drug resistance to both classes of approved influenza antivirals, and thus may represent a highly active antiviral therapy for seasonal and pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2010-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Jack T.; Hoopes, Justin D.; Le, Minh H.; Smee, Donald F.; Patick, Amy K.; Faix, Dennis J.; Blair, Patrick J.; de Jong, Menno D.; Prichard, Mark N.; Went, Gregory T.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec3316b6d33659c1070099a4395a1c25eeacc446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2825274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","MDCK","TCAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oseltamivir-resistant influenza","H1N1 influenza viruses","oseltamivir-resistant viruses","amantadine","drug-resistant viruses","seasonal viruses","drug-resistant seasonal","pandemic influenza","threat of influenza","TCAD regimen","triple combination antiviral drug","classes of influenza antivirals","majority of seasonal H1N1 strains","H1N1 virus","double combination","classes of approved influenza antivirals","antiviral activity","seasonal H3N2 strains","baseline drug resistance","adamantanes","active antiviral therapy","drugs","synergy","ribavirin","concentrations","data","public health","neuraminidase inhibitors","Widespread resistance","effective therapy","prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor","World Health Organization","novel","different mechanisms of action","subsequent spread","infection model","marginal utility","healthcare systems","rapid emergence","treatment modality","MDCK cells","single agents","rimantadine","need","century","NAIs"],"language":"en"},

Because Stat3 in tumor-associated immune cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and hinders TLR9-induced immune stimulation, we tested CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates for anti-tumor effects. When injected locally at the tumor site or systemically through an intravenous route, the CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates access tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, inhibit Stat3 expression, leading to activation of tumor-associated immune cells, and ultimately potent anti-tumor immune responses.

Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFN\u03B1 and \u03B2) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFN\u03B1 production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFN\u03B1 production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFN\u03B1 by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFN\u03B1 induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFN\u03B1 production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFN\u03B1 induction.","publish_time":"2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deal, Emily M.; Jaimes, Maria C.; Crawford, Sue E.; Estes, Mary K.; Greenberg, Harry B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e12e72939bfeb49c8865a15d0c1bc9a4f99c0ece.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRV","Luminex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RRV infection","Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs","primary human peripheral pDCs","subset of pDCs","Production of IFN\u03B1","RRV replicates","primary human cells","viral infection","RRV stimulus","small subset of human primary pDCs","RRV exposure","inactivated RRV","viral dsRNA","impaired IFN\u03B1 production","substantial IFN\u03B1 production","control of rotavirus infection","RRV-permissive small subset","viral stimulus","viral replication","rhesus rotavirus","trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells","purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells","multiple rotavirus strains","evidence of IFN\u03B1 induction","IFN production","viral nonstructural protein","novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFN\u03B1 induction","minor subset","accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease","dsRNA virus","study of mechanisms","immune mechanisms","virus replicates","pDC activation","immune responses","Characterization of pDC responses","B cell responses","innate immunity","degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors","fibroblast cell types","trypsin cleavage of VP4","increased levels of systemic type","flow cytometry","variety of epithelial","surface proteins","powerful experimental system","Luminex","leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea","stimulation","children","maturation","functionality","establishment of extraintestinal viremia","antigenemia","Rotaviruses","report","results","data"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the \u201Cantigen capsid-incorporation\u201D strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon\u0027s natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response.","publish_time":"2010-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthews, Qiana L.; Fatima, Aiman; Tang, Yizhe; Perry, Brian A.; Tsuruta, Yuko; Komarova, Svetlana; Timares, Laura; Zhao, Chunxia; Makarova, Natalia; Borovjagin, Anton V.; Stewart, Phoebe L.; Wu, Hongju; Blackwell, Jerry L.; Curiel, David T.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fac2afdb0450de6c766a24baf26e3ce6e03e09e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2910733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ad capsid protein hexon","antigen capsid-incorporation","Ad serotype","Ad virion","multivalent anti-HIV vectors","present HIV antigens","capsid incorporation strategies","transgene incorporation","Ad-based vaccine development","generation of anti-Ad immune response","cellular anti-HIV response","conventional Ad-based vaccines","HIV glycoprotein gp41","capsid structure of viral vectors","major capsid protein hexon","novel vectors","generation of multivalent vaccine vectors","incorporation site","antigen expression","strategy","HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response","HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region","transgene expression","given antigen","incorporation of antigenic peptides","HVR2","sub-optimal results","study","sub-optimal clinical results","variety of vaccine applications","infectious diseases","amino acid region","major surface-exposed domains","MPER","hexon\u0027s natural role","numerical representation","cancer","need","heterologous peptide epitopes","means","context","cases","Ad5","immunity","order","vaccinations"],"language":"en"},

These disorders are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that affect alveolar walls. Typical features of ILD include dyspnea, diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, and abnormal pulmonary function tests with restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children. The present article reviews current concepts of pathophysiological mechanisms, etiology and diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutic strategies. The following diagnostic grouping is used to discuss the various causes of pediatric ILD: 1) exposure-related ILD; 2) systemic disease-associated ILD; 3) alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD; and 4) ILD specific to infancy. Therapeutic options include mainly anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and/or anti-fibrotic drugs. The outcome is highly variable with a mortality rate around 15%.

In India, all mild as well as critically ill cases were admitted and treated in the government hospitals during the initial phase of the pandemic. The present study was undertaken during this early phase of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The role of viral load and host factors in the pathogenesis were assessed by examining 26 mild (MP), 15 critically ill patients (CIP) and 20 healthy controls from Pune, India. Sequential blood and lung aspirate samples were collected from CIP. Viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels were determined from the plasma and lung aspirates of the patients. TLR levels were determined by staining and FACS analysis. Gene profiling was done for both cells in the lung aspirates and PBMCs using TaqMan Low Density arrays. Antibody titres and isotyping was done using HA protein based ELISAs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 13/15 critically ill patients expired. All plasma samples were negative for the virus irrespective of the patient\u0027s category. Sequential lung samples from CIP showed lower viral loads questioning association of viral replication with the severity. Anti-rpH1N1-09-HA-IgG titres were significantly higher in critically ill patients and both categories circulated exclusively IgG1 isotype. Critically ill patients exhibited increase in TLR-3, 4, 7 and decrease in TLR-2 expressions. The disease severity correlated with increased plasma levels of IL1RA, IL2, IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and IL10. Majority of the immune-function genes were down-regulated in the PBMCs and up-regulated in the cells from lung aspirates of critically ill patients. No distinct pattern differentiating fatal and surviving patients was observed when sequential samples were examined for various parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity was associated with pronounced impairment of host immune response.","publish_time":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arankalle, Vidya A.; Lole, Kavita S.; Arya, Ravi P.; Tripathy, Anuradha S.; Ramdasi, Ashwini Y.; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Sangle, Shashi A.; Kadam, Deelip B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50e55ab8dd87f7523b7f25203ef10004c8d3b13e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2948498.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2948498/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIP","FACS"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","Sequential lung samples","lung aspirates","surviving patients","ill cases","sequential samples","plasma samples","lung aspirate samples","TLR levels","disease severity","role of viral load","chemokine levels","increased plasma levels of IL1RA","Sequential blood","cells","PBMCs","pandemic H1N1","India","lower viral loads questioning association of viral replication","HA-IgG titres","host factors","HA protein","early phase","initial phase","virus infections","Antibody titres","pronounced impairment of host immune response","immune-function genes","high number of severe pneumonia cases","IL2","IL6","TaqMan Low Density arrays","CCL3","considerable mortality","healthy controls","CCL4","isotyping","distinct pattern","pathogenesis","staining","cytokines","categories","IL10","Majority","government hospitals","Pune","METHODOLOGY","various parameters","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","present study","FACS analysis","Anti-rpH1N1","IgG1 isotype","BACKGROUND","patient\u0027s category","ELISAs","Gene profiling","CONCLUSIONS","expressions"],"language":"en"},

Prior studies demonstrated that two extended domains of ribosomal protein L3 form an allosteric switch between the pre- and post-translocational states. Missing was an explanation for how the movements of these domains are communicated among the ribosome\u0027s functional centers. Here, a third domain of L3 called the basic thumb, that protrudes roughly perpendicular from the W-finger and is nestled in the center of a cagelike structure formed by elements from three separate domains of the large subunit rRNA is investigated. Mutagenesis of basically charged amino acids of the basic thumb to alanines followed by detailed analyses suggests that it acts as a molecular clamp, playing a role in allosterically communicating the ribosome\u0027s tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the peptidyltransferase center, facilitating coordination of their functions through the elongation cycle. The observation that these mutations affected translational fidelity, virus propagation and cell growth demonstrates how small structural changes at the atomic scale can propagate outward to broadly impact the biology of cell.","publish_time":"2010-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meskauskas, Arturas; Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4bee92db40a13e75adfb050f66de8ff586b0731.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2995063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["separate domains","distinct domains of ribosomal proteins","extended domains of ribosomal protein L3","basic thumb","functional states","ribosome\u0027s functional centers","RNA interactions","elongation factor","cell growth","peptidyltransferase center","critical functions","elongation cycle","domain of L3","biology of cell","post-translocational states","large subunit rRNA","ribosome\u0027s tRNA occupancy status","translational fidelity","virus propagation","allosteric switch","small structural changes","mutations","alanines","region","amino acids","atomic scale","role","elements","coordination","cagelike structure","detailed analyses","observation","Prior studies","W-finger","explanation","molecular clamp","Mutagenesis","movements","Missing"],"language":"en"},

DNA probes, 70-nt long, some including the nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine (dInosine), were analyzed for hybridization tolerance to different amounts and distributions of mismatching bases, e.g. synonymous mutations, in target DNA. Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex\u00AE system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity. An algorithm, NucZip, was constructed to model the nucleation and zipping phases of hybridization, integrating both local and distant binding contributions. It predicted hybridization more exactly than previous algorithms, and has the potential to guide the design of variation-tolerant yet specific probes.","publish_time":"2010-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6hrmalm, Christina; Jobs, Magnus; Eriksson, Ronnie; Golbob, Sultan; Elfaitouri, Amal; Benachenhou, Farid; Str\u00F8mme, Maria; Blomberg, Jonas","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02f267368636c422f19d77d3be96de3c0dcbceef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2995084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["3M","3M TMAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nt probes","DNA probes","hybridization tolerance","specific probes","shorter probes","mer probes","mismatching positions","zipping phases of hybridization","contiguous matching stretches","placed dInosine substitutions","wobble positions","mismatches","target DNA","nucleic acid sequence variation","number of matching nucleotides","nucleic acid-based techniques","design of variation","distributions of mismatching bases","detection of infectious agents","different amounts","synonymous mutations","subsequent analysis","ss","influenza viruses","main problems","nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine","potential","Luminex","fold","nitroindole","TMAC buffer","distant binding contributions","system","wobbles","previous algorithms","nucleation","preserved specificity","regions","strong impact","Microsphere","contrast","NucZip"],"language":"en"},

In addition, they must minimise false alarms during a normal influenza season. We develop a method that uses historical syndromic influenza data from the existing surveillance system \u0027SERVIS\u0027 (Scottish Enhanced Respiratory Virus Infection Surveillance) for influenza-like illness (ILI) in Scotland. METHODS: We develop an algorithm based on the weekly case ratio (WCR) of reported ILI cases to generate an alarm for pandemic influenza. From the seasonal influenza data from 13 Scottish health boards, we estimate the joint probability distribution of the country-level WCR and the number of health boards showing synchronous increases in reported influenza cases over the previous week. Pandemic cases are sampled with various case reporting rates from simulated pandemic influenza infections and overlaid with seasonal SERVIS data from 2001 to 2007. Using this combined time series we test our method for speed of detection, sensitivity and specificity. Also, the 2008-09 SERVIS ILI cases are used for testing detection performances of the three methods with a real pandemic data. RESULTS: We compare our method, based on our simulation study, to the moving-average Cumulative Sums (Mov-Avg Cusum) and ILI rate threshold methods and find it to be more sensitive and rapid. For 1% case reporting and detection specificity of 95%, our method is 100% sensitive and has median detection time (MDT) of 4 weeks while the Mov-Avg Cusum and ILI rate threshold methods are, respectively, 97% and 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. At 99% specificity, our method remains 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. Although the threshold method maintains its sensitivity of 100% with MDT of 5 weeks, sensitivity of Mov-Avg Cusum declines to 92% with increased MDT of 6 weeks. For a two-fold decrease in the case reporting rate (0.5%) and 99% specificity, the WCR and threshold methods, respectively, have MDT of 5 and 6 weeks with both having sensitivity close to 100% while the Mov-Avg Cusum method can only manage sensitivity of 77% with MDT of 6 weeks. However, the WCR and Mov-Avg Cusum methods outperform the ILI threshold method by 1 week in retrospective detection of the 2009 pandemic in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: While computationally and statistically simple to implement, the WCR algorithm is capable of raising alarms, rapidly and sensitively, for influenza pandemics against a background of seasonal influenza. Although the algorithm was developed using the SERVIS data, it has the capacity to be used at other geographic scales and for different disease systems where buying some early extra time is critical.","publish_time":"2010-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Brajendra K; Savill, Nicholas J; Ferguson, Neil M; Robertson, Chris; Woolhouse, Mark EJ","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2c969ba79febb099c393fe284d008f535f85ea5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3001734.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WCR","MDT"],"locations":["Scotland"],"keyphrases":["weeks","ILI threshold method","seasonal influenza data","control of pandemic influenza","influenza pandemics","reported influenza cases","Mov-Avg Cusum methods","background of seasonal influenza","ILI rate threshold methods","Pandemic cases","sensitivity of Mov","SERVIS ILI cases","simulated pandemic influenza infections","detection specificity","historical syndromic influenza data","reported ILI cases","normal influenza season","seasonal SERVIS data","WCR algorithm","real pandemic data","increased MDT","Avg Cusum declines","speed of detection","retrospective detection","median detection time","sensitivity close","surveillance systems","country-level WCR","testing detection performances","various case reporting rates","Scottish health boards","weekly case ratio","false alarms","Scotland","number of health boards","existing surveillance system","early extra time","combined time series","Scottish Enhanced Respiratory Virus Infection Surveillance","previous week","different disease systems","synchronous increases","moving-average Cumulative Sums","joint probability distribution","geographic scales","fold decrease","Key","illness","simulation study","capacity","addition","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The emerging of still new escape variants of influenza A viruses causing epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics represents a threat for human population. Therefore, current, hot task of influenza virus research is to look for a way how to get us closer to a universal vaccine. Combination of chosen conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating also cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for improving protection against drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses and reduces the impact of future pandemic strains. Antigenically conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin (HA2 gp) and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (eM2) are promising candidates for preparation of broadly protective HA2- or eM2-based vaccine that may aid in pandemic preparedness. Overall protective effect could be achieved by contribution of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that have been studied extensively to reach much broader control of influenza infection. In this review we present the state-of-art in this field. We describe known adaptive immune mechanisms mediated by influenza specific B- and T-cells involved in the anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of innate immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of neutralization of influenza infection mediated by antibodies, the role of CTL in viral elimination and new approaches to develop epitope based vaccine inducing cross-protective influenza virus-specific immune response.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanekov\u00E1, Zuzana; Vare\u010Dkov\u00E1, Eva","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9c4b287820b6a554a2b46e8b74a1c5f6d88213b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3009981.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza specific B","cross-protective influenza virus-specific immune response","new escape variants of influenza","anti-influenza immune defense","broader control of influenza infection","drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses","protective HA2","cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells","hot task of influenza virus research","protective effect","cross-protective antibody response","best studied viruses","eM2-based vaccine","contribution of epitopes","cytotoxic T-lymphocytes","universal vaccine","known adaptive immune mechanisms","HA2 gp","new approaches","conserved antigens","role of CTL","mechanisms of neutralization","pandemic preparedness","contribution of innate immunity","impact of future pandemic strains","conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin","periodic worldwide pandemics","protection","epidemics","viral elimination","ectodomain of matrix protein","effective prevention","threat","attractive strategy","promising candidates","preparation","antibodies","human population","emerging","Combination","state","art","way","review","field"],"language":"en"},

We explored an alternative approach that entailed genetically modifying a pathogen with broad host specificity so that it no longer caused disease, but carried a gene to disrupt the cane toad life cycle in a species specific manner. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The adult beta globin gene was selected as the model gene for proof of concept of autoimmunity as a biocontrol method for cane toads. A previous report showed injection of bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs as well as reduced survival. In B. marinus we established for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin exists. The effect of injecting B. marinus tadpoles with purified recombinant adult globin protein was then assessed using behavioural (swim speed in tadpoles and jump length in metamorphs), developmental (time to metamorphosis, weight and length at various developmental stages, protein profile of adult globin) and genetic (adult globin mRNA levels) measures. However, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals. Further, globin delivery using Bohle iridovirus, an Australian ranavirus isolate belonging to the Iridovirus family, did not reduce the survival of metamorphs or alter the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While we were able to show for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin does occur in B. marinus, we were not able to induce autoimmunity and disrupt metamorphosis. The short development time of B. marinus tadpoles may preclude this approach.","publish_time":"2011-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pallister, Jackie A.; Halliday, Damien C.T.; Robinson, Anthony J.; Venables, Daryl; Voysey, Rhonda D.; Boyle, Donna G.; Shanmuganathan, Thayalini; Hardy, Christopher M.; Siddon, Nicole A.; Hyatt, Alex D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ba5919b2b4c229c9c1685852cf19a1d727ac220.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3026784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["adult beta globin gene","globin delivery","form of beta globin","protein profile of adult globin","marinus tadpoles","adult globin mRNA levels","purified recombinant adult globin protein","marinus-specific pathogen","survival of metamorphs","injection of bullfrog tadpoles","length","model gene","cane toads","autoimmunity","short development time of","switch","metamorphosis","cane toad life cycle","Bohle iridovirus","Iridovirus family","control animals","reduced survival","alternative approach","various developmental stages","species specific manner","biological control agent","weight","Australian ranavirus isolate","use","alteration","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","biocontrol method","proof of concept","Bufo","differences","previous report","swim speed","effect of injecting","Chaunus","measures","notorious vertebrate pests","broad host specificity","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","years","SIGNIFICANCE","efforts","CONCLUSIONS","disease"],"language":"en"},

In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.","publish_time":"2011-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spentzas, Thomas; Shapley, Rebekah KH; Aguirre, Carlos Acuna; Meals, Elizabeth; Lazar, Lauren; Rayburn, Mark S; Walker, Brett S; English, B Keith","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/960d26b871399621a1c32ff4b8459429893caf18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3037927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","LAC","NMDA","APV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of NMDA","MRSA sepsis","antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates","prototypical CA-MRSA isolates","NMDA inhibitors","antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria","macrophage TNF response","NMDA receptor antagonism","MRSA-stimulated RAW264","addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion","TNF concentration","addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion","unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist","addition of APV","anesthetic ketamine","presence of daptomycin","presence of vancomycin","USA300 strain LAC","USA400 strain MW2","bacterial stimulation","cells","MK","prolonged host inflammatory response","methyl-D","antagonism of N","sepsis simulation model","community-associated strains of methicillin","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","aspartate","phosphono-valerate","mechanism","macrophages","Infections","therapeutic significance","dizocilpine","dose-dependent fashion","inocula","findings","combinations","receptors","hour","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","ELISA","agents","CFU","hrs","Supernatants"],"language":"en"},

Evaluations of the pandemic response are beginning to appear in the public domain. DISCUSSION: We argue that, despite the enormous effort made to control the pandemic, it is now time to acknowledge that many of the population-based public health interventions may not have been well considered. Prior to the pandemic, there was limited scientific evidence to support border control measures. In particular no border screening measures would have detected prodromal or asymptomatic infections, and asymptomatic infections with pandemic influenza were common. School closures, when they were partial or of short duration, would not have interrupted spread of the virus in school-aged children, the group with the highest rate of infection worldwide. In most countries where they were available, neuraminidase inhibitors were not distributed quickly enough to have had an effect at the population level, although they will have benefited individuals, and prophylaxis within closed communities will have been effective. A pandemic specific vaccine will have protected the people who received it, although in most countries only a small minority was vaccinated, and often a small minority of those most at risk. The pandemic vaccine was generally not available early enough to have influenced the shape of the first pandemic wave and it is likely that any future pandemic vaccine manufactured using current technology will also be available too late, at least in one hemisphere. SUMMARY: Border screening, school closure, widespread anti-viral prophylaxis and a pandemic-specific vaccine were unlikely to have been effective during a pandemic which was less severe than anticipated in the pandemic plans of many countries. These were cornerstones of the population-based public health response. Similar responses would be even less likely to be effective in a more severe pandemic. We agree with the recommendation from the World Health Organisation that pandemic preparedness plans need review.","publish_time":"2011-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, Heath A; Priest, Patricia C; Mercer, Geoffry N; Dowse, Gary K","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d165a082f6c249fb4aa2fe497a85258504cd01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048535.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic plans","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","pandemic response","severe pandemic","pandemic wave","pandemic specific vaccine","pandemic-specific vaccine","future pandemic vaccine","pandemic preparedness plans","public health response","countries","public health interventions","border screening measures","World Health Organisation","World Health Organization","border control measures","asymptomatic infections","School closures","population level","public domain","small minority","school-aged children","widespread anti-viral prophylaxis","group","current technology","virus","scientific evidence","interrupted spread","closed communities","benefited individuals","review","SUMMARY","short duration","highest rate of infection","recommendation","year","neuraminidase inhibitors","Similar responses","effect","risk","people","enormous effort","shape","cornerstones","Evaluations","hemisphere","BACKGROUND","time","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

Based on our previous studies showing that feeding on an amino acid meal induces TOR signaling in Ae. aegypti, we used proteomics and RNAi to functionally identify midgut epithelial cell proteins that contribute to RER whorl formation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were maintained on sugar alone (unfed), or fed an amino acid meal, and then midgut epithelial cells were analyzed by electron microscopy and protein biochemistry. The size and number of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells were found to decrease significantly after feeding, and several KDEL-containing proteins were shown to have altered expression levels. LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was used to analyze midgut microsomal proteins isolated from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes, and of the 127 proteins identified, 8 were chosen as candidate whorl forming proteins. Three candidate proteins were COPI coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, beta\u0027), all of which appeared to be present at higher levels in microsomal fractions from unfed mosquitoes. Using RNAi to knockdown alpha-COPI expression, electron microscopy revealed that both the size and number of RER whorls were dramatically reduced in unfed mosquitoes, and moreover, that extended regions of swollen RER were prevalent in fed mosquitoes. Lastly, while a deficiency in alpha-COPI had no effect on early trypsin protein synthesis or secretion 3 hr post blood meal (PBM), expression of late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM was completely blocked. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-COPI was found to be required for the formation of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells of unfed Aa. aegypti mosquitoes, as well as for the expression of late phase midgut proteases.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Guoli; Isoe, Jun; Day, W.

Macrophages recognize influenza A virus infection with their pattern recognition receptors, and are involved in the activation of proper innate immune response. Here, we have used high-throughput subcellular proteomics combined with bioinformatics to provide a global view of host cellular events that are activated in response to influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages. We show that viral infection regulates the expression and/or subcellular localization of more than one thousand host proteins at early phases of infection. Our data reveals that there are dramatic changes in mitochondrial and nuclear proteomes in response to infection. We show that a rapid cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, followed by their secretion, contributes to inflammasome activation and apoptosis seen in the infected macrophages. Also, our results demonstrate that P2X(7) receptor and src tyrosine kinase activity are essential for inflammasome activation during influenza A virus infection. Finally, we show that influenza A virus infection is associated with robust secretion of different danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) suggesting an important role for DAMPs in host response to influenza A virus infection. In conclusion, our high-throughput quantitative proteomics study provides important new insight into host-response against influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages.","publish_time":"2011-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lietz\u00E9n, Niina; \u00D6hman, Tiina; Rintahaka, Johanna; Julkunen, Ilkka; Aittokallio, Tero; Matikainen, Sampsa; Nyman, Tuula A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b18559c0c4de907cce17857d77321b52375ea36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3093355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEwMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","Influenza","viral infection","host response","host-response","early phases of infection","host proteins","human primary macrophages","inflammasome activation","infected macrophages","activation of proper innate immune response","important pathogens","important role","DAMPs","high-throughput subcellular proteomics","important new insight","high-throughput quantitative proteomics study","global view of host cellular events","subcellular localization","robust secretion of different danger","rapid cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins","acute respiratory diseases","src tyrosine kinase activity","dramatic changes","nuclear proteomes","annual epidemics","molecular patterns","bioinformatics","pattern recognition receptors","humans","cathepsins","expression","viruses","apoptosis","P2X","data reveals","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

For other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases. Furthermore, several studies indicate that virus proliferation can be arrested using specific proteinase inhibitors supporting the belief that proteinases are indeed important during infection. Prompted by this, we set out to analyse and predict cleavage by the coronavirus main proteinase using computational methods. RESULTS: We retrieved sequence data on seven fully sequenced coronaviruses and identified the main 3CL proteinase cleavage sites in polyproteins using alignments. A neural network was trained to recognise the cleavage sites in the genomes obtaining a sensitivity of 87.0% and a specificity of 99.0%. Several proteins known to be cleaved by other viruses were submitted to prediction as well as proteins suspected relevant in coronavirus pathology. Cleavage sites were predicted in proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), transcription factors CREB-RP and OCT-1, and components of the ubiquitin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction method NetCorona predicts coronavirus cleavage sites with high specificity and several potential cleavage candidates were identified which might be important to elucidate coronavirus pathology. Furthermore, the method might assist in design of proteinase inhibitors for treatment of SARS and possible future diseases caused by coronaviruses.

METHODS: We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. RESULTS: We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, ring vaccination (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95% of household contacts are traced, 80% of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that in most cases the ability to trace 1\u20135 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination, but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination, provided contact tracing is feasible. Uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox (infectiousness, vaccine efficacy) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination. If initiated, ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination, should include contacts of contacts (whenever there is sufficient capacity) and should be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance.","publish_time":"2004-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porco, Travis C; Holbrook, Karen A; Fernyak, Susan E; Portnoy, Diane L; Reiter, Randy; Arag\u00F3n, Tom\u00E1s J","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/367af6bb9a8bbda02206506a819656bb6f14ce4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC520756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC520756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination of contacts","contacts of contacts","mass vaccination","Previous smallpox ring vaccination models","post-exposure vaccination","discontinuation of routine vaccination","social contacts","casual contacts","household contacts","surveillance of asymptomatic contacts","nature of bioterrorist smallpox","Small introductions of smallpox","sufficient capacity","isolation of cases","infectiousness","limited response capacity","contact tracing","continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission","public awareness","network structure","response logistics","limited numbers of vaccinators","heterogeneity","rapid diagnosis","symptoms","vaccine efficacy","support","BACKGROUND","individuals","day","index case","times","delays","CONCLUSIONS","Uncertainties","containment","ability","workplace","circumstances","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analysis of the S gene showed that our isolates could be classified into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences isolated in The Netherlands in 1988 and 2003, indicating that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating.","publish_time":"2005-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo\u00EBs, Elien; Vijgen, Leen; Keyaerts, Els; Zlateva, Kalina; Li, Sandra; Maes, Piet; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Berkhout, Ben; van der Hoek, Lia; Van Ranst, Marc","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbd8eed5192247d945644651f0a9de6166992567.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC549190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC549190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Belgium"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43","incidence of HCoV","HCoV-NL63 positive samples","presence of HCoV","prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences","NL63 infection","human coronavirus NL63","children","respiratory diseases","respiratory tract infections","human coronaviruses OC43","serious respiratory symptoms","RESULTS","subtypes","SARS-CoV","optimized pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay","S gene","notation","Sequence analysis","isolates","winter seasons","Belgium","CONCLUSIONS","Netherlands","METHODS","BACKGROUND","study","cocirculating","end"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it is generally well-adapted viruses, infecting many of us without doing much harm, and with the capacity to hide in our neurons for life. In rare situations, however, the primary infection becomes generalized or involves the brain. Normally, the primary HSV infection is asymptomatic, and a crucial element in the early restriction of virus replication and thus avoidance of symptoms from the infection is the concerted action of different arms of the innate immune response. An early and light struggle inhibiting some HSV replication will spare the host from the real war against huge amounts of virus later in infection. As far as such a war will jeopardize the life of the host, it will be in both interests, including the virus, to settle the conflict amicably. Some important weapons of the unspecific defence and the early strikes and beginning battle during the first days of a HSV infection are discussed in this review. Generally, macrophages are orchestrating a multitude of anti-herpetic actions during the first hours of the attack. In a first wave of responses, cytokines, primarily type I interferons (IFN) and tumour necrosis factor are produced and exert a direct antiviral effect and activate the macrophages themselves. In the next wave, interleukin (IL)-12 together with the above and other cytokines induce production of IFN-\u03B3 in mainly NK cells. Many positive feed-back mechanisms and synergistic interactions intensify these systems and give rise to heavy antiviral weapons such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. This results in the generation of an alliance against the viral enemy. However, these heavy weapons have to be controlled to avoid too much harm to the host. By IL-4 and others, these reactions are hampered, but they are still allowed in foci of HSV replication, thus focusing the activity to only relevant sites. So, no hero does it alone. Rather, an alliance of cytokines, macrophages and other cells seems to play a central role. Implications of this for future treatment modalities are shortly considered.","publish_time":"2005-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellermann-Eriksen, Svend","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33f0a6576216e3c8ff02dcb1affaa66c9f08e30b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1215526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1215526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary HSV infection","primary infection","foci of HSV replication","macrophages","host","early restriction of virus replication","heavy weapons","alliance of cytokines","heavy antiviral weapons","huge amounts of virus","Herpes simplex virus","early strikes","important weapons","type","life","IL","harm","production of IFN","real war","NK cells","old viruses","wave of responses","direct antiviral effect","well-adapted viruses","reactive oxygen species","systems","concerted action of different arms","mechanisms","synergistic interactions","unspecific defence","rise","crucial element","avoidance of symptoms","innate immune response","multitude of anti-herpetic actions","hours","nitric oxide","tumour necrosis factor","interferons","activity","light struggle","positive feed","history of evolution","Implications","future treatment modalities","generation","battle","days","viral enemy","rare situations","relevant sites","humans","capacity","neurons","central role","results","interleukin","brain","review","attack","interests","conflict","reactions","hero"],"language":"en"},

From optical to electrical systems, from label-dependent to label-free approaches, from single to multi-analyte and array formats, this wide range of possibilities makes the research field very diversified and competitive. New challenges and requirements for an ideal detector suitable for nucleic acid analysis include high sensitivity and high specificity protocol that can be completed in a relatively short time offering at the same time low detection limit. Moreover, systems that can be miniaturized and automated present a significant advantage over conventional technology, especially if detection is needed in the field. Electrical system technology for nucleic acid-based detection is an enabling mode for making miniaturized to micro- and nanometer scale bio-monitoring devices via the fusion of modern micro- and nanofabrication technology and molecular biotechnology. The electrical biosensors that rely on the conversion of the Watson-Crick base-pair recognition event into a useful electrical signal are advancing rapidly, and recently are receiving much attention as a valuable tool for microbial pathogen detection. Pathogens may pose a serious threat to humans, animal and plants, thus their detection and analysis is a significant element of public health. Although different conventional methods for detection of pathogenic microorganisms and their toxins exist and are currently being applied, improvements of molecular-based detection methodologies have changed these traditional detection techniques and introduced a new era of rapid, miniaturized and automated electrical chip detection technologies into pathogen identification sector.

Adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogenesis of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. We report the first findings of measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with SARS-CoV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In order to characterize clinically relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously. Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness. All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies. Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection. Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed. Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation. Half of the group I animals were infected with a recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV derived from the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. This infectious clone produced disease indistinguishable from wild-type Urbani strain. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV infection of cynomolgus macaques did not reproduce the severe illness seen in the majority of adult human cases of SARS; however, our results suggest similarities to the milder syndrome of SARS-CoV infection characteristically seen in young children.","publish_time":"2006-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawler, James V; Endy, Timothy P; Hensley, Lisa E; Garrison, Aura; Fritz, Elizabeth A; Lesar, May; Baric, Ralph S; Kulesh, David A; Norwood, David A; Wasieloski, Leonard P; Ulrich, Melanie P; Slezak, Tom R; Vitalis, Elizabeth; Huggins, John W; Jahrling, Peter B; Paragas, Jason","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c56ffdaf1cfbae5a6ed0abea495eaf7fa1cbc031.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1435788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV Urbani strain","SARS-CoV infection of cynomolgus macaques","recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV","milder syndrome of SARS","relevant parameters of SARS","underlying pathogenesis of SARS","majority of adult human cases of SARS","NHPs","groups","disease indistinguishable","prominent disease","findings of measurable clinical disease","severe illness","animals","nonhuman primates","nares","wild-type Urbani strain","intravenous inoculation","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome","moderate symptomatic illness","Clinical laboratory tests","associated coronavirus","affected global health","major economic disruption","evidence of viral replication","revealed unifocal","multifocal pneumonia","order","mucosal route","results","similarities","neutralizing antibodies","effective vaccines","days","BACKGROUND","Chest radiographs","bronchus","young children","conjunctiva","CONCLUSIONS","Adequate animal models","therapeutics","METHODS","Half","postinfection"],"language":"en"},

Current vaccines rely on live attenuated strains of B. abortus, which can revert to their pathogenic status and thus are not totally safe for use in humans. Therefore, the development of mucosal live vaccines using the food-grade lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, as an antigen delivery vector, is an attractive alternative and a safer vaccination strategy against B. abortus. Here, we report the construction of L. lactis strains genetically modified to produce B. abortus GroEL heat-shock protein, a candidate antigen, in two cellular locations, intracellular or secreted. RESULTS: Only the secreted form of GroEL was stably produced in L. lactis, suggesting a detrimental effect of GroEL protein when intracellularly produced in this bacterium. Only trace amounts of mature GroEL were detected in the supernatant fraction of induced lactococcal cultures, and the GroEL precursor remained stacked in the cell fraction. Attempts to raise the secretion yields were made, but even when GroEL was fused to a synthetic propeptide, secretion of this antigen was not improved. CONCLUSION: We found that L. lactis is able to produce, and to secrete, a stable form of GroEL into the extracellular medium. Despite the low secretion efficiency of GroEL, which suggest that this antigen interacts with the cell envelope of L. lactis, secretion seems to be the best way to achieve both production and protein yields, regardless of cellular location. The L. lactis strain secreting GroEL has potential for in vivo immunization.","publish_time":"2006-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miyoshi, Anderson; Berm\u00FAdez-Humar\u00E1n, Luis G; Ribeiro, Luciana A; Le Loir, Yves; Oliveira, S\u00E9rgio C; Langella, Philippe; Azevedo, Vasco","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acb6848d159dbf4970d1f76474a634110b3558e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1444932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brucella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GroEL precursor","secreting GroEL","secreted form of GroEL","stable form of GroEL","lactis strains","low secretion efficiency of GroEL","abortus GroEL heat-shock protein","detrimental effect of GroEL protein","Lactococcus lactis","trace amounts of mature GroEL","secretion yields","candidate antigen","Brucella abortus","protein yields","antigen delivery vector","cell fraction","humans","live attenuated strains of","Current vaccines","development of mucosal live vaccines","cellular locations","cell envelope of","facultative intracellular pathogen","food-grade lactic acid bacterium","supernatant fraction of induced lactococcal cultures","safer vaccination strategy","cattle","production","potential","synthetic propeptide","best way","extracellular medium","BACKGROUND","immunization","use","RESULTS","construction of","pathogenic status","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Were such a virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently between humans, control would almost certainly be hampered by limited vaccine supplies unless global spread could be substantially delayed. Moreover, the large increases that have occurred in international air travel might be expected to lead to more rapid global dissemination than in previous pandemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To evaluate the potential of local control measures and travel restrictions to impede global dissemination, we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. These models have been shown to be capable of accurately forecasting local and global spread of epidemic and pandemic influenza. We show that under most scenarios restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics, unless almost all travel ceases very soon after epidemics are detected. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce local transmission of influenza are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of global spread and less vulnerable to implementation delays than air travel restrictions. Nevertheless, under the most plausible scenarios, achievable delays are small compared with the time needed to accumulate substantial vaccine stocks.","publish_time":"2006-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Ben S; Pitman, Richard J; Edmunds, W.

But due to the size and omega-like shape of caveolae it is possible that A-MLV initially binds cells outside of caveolae. Rafts have been suggested to be pre-caveolae and we here investigate whether A-MLV initially binds to its receptor Pit2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, in rafts or caveolae or outside these cholesterol-rich microdomains. RESULTS: Here, we show that a high amount of cell-bound A-MLV was attached to large rafts of NIH3T3 at the time of investigation. These large rafts were not enriched in caveolin-1, a major structural component of caveolae. In addition, they are rather of natural occurrence in NIH3T3 cells than a result of patching of smaller rafts by A-MLV. Thus cells incubated in parallel with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped MLV particles showed the same pattern of large rafts as cells incubated with A-MLV, but VSV-G pseudotyped MLV particles did not show any preference to attach to these large microdomains.

Accurate prediction of the binding between short peptides and the MHC molecules has long been a principal challenge for immunoinformatics. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions: instead of categorizing peptides as \u0022binders\u0022 or \u0022non-binders\u0022 or as \u0022strong binders\u0022 and \u0022weak binders\u0022, recent methods seek to make predictions about precise binding affinities. RESULTS: We developed a quantitative support vector machine regression (SVR) approach, called SVRMHC, to model peptide-MHC binding affinities. As a non-linear method, SVRMHC was able to generate models that out-performed existing linear models, such as the \u0022additive method\u0022. By adopting a new \u002211-factor encoding\u0022 scheme, SVRMHC takes into account similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids constituting the input peptides. When applied to MHC-peptide binding data for three mouse class I MHC alleles, the SVRMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced previously. Furthermore, comparisons based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that SVRMHC was able to out-perform several prominent methods in identifying strongly binding peptides. CONCLUSION: As a method with demonstrated performance in the quantitative modeling of MHC-peptide binding and in identifying strong binders, SVRMHC is a promising immunoinformatics tool with not inconsiderable future potential.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen; Meng, Xiangshan; Xu, Qiqi; Flower, Darren R; Li, Tongbin","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/362f9e6b508a42ffebfd1a95d146955d59c7cea0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1513606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1513606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding peptides","MHC-peptide binding data","SVRMHC models","model peptide-MHC binding affinities","quantitative modeling of MHC","precise binding affinities","strong binders","MHC molecules","MHC alleles","peptide epitopes","quantitative predictions","weak binders","non-binders","short peptides","categorizing peptides","input peptides","accurate predictions","non-linear method","additive method","existing linear models","recent methods","prominent methods","quantitative support vector machine regression","promising immunoinformatics tool","major histocompatibility complex proteins","mouse class","MHCs","approach","important event","physicochemical properties","amino acids","scheme","account similarities","analysis","demonstrated performance","inconsiderable future potential","Receiver","Characteristic","cellular immune response","ROC","principal challenge","factor","BACKGROUND","comparisons","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, most infections are believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. A diagnostic study was performed to compare conventional viral tests with the recently developed real-time PCR technique. METHOD: Samples from children aged under 5 years presenting to a tertiary PICU suspected of having a lower respiratory tract infection were tested using conventional methods (viral culture and immunofluorescence) and real-time PCR during the winter season from December 2004 to May 2005. Conventional methods were used to check for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1\u20133, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. Real-time PCR was used to test for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1\u20134, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were included, of whom 11 (48%) were positive for a respiratory virus by conventional methods. Real-time PCR confirmed all of these positive results. In addition, real-time PCR identified 22 more viruses in 11 patients, yielding a total of 22 (96%) patients with a positive sample. More than one virus was detected in eight (35%) children. CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR for respiratory viruses was found to be a sensitive and reliable method in PICU patients with lower respiratory tract infection, increasing the diagnostic yield twofold compared to conventional methods.","publish_time":"2006-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"van de Pol, Alma C; Wolfs, Tom FW; Jansen, Nicolaas JG; van Loon, Anton M; Rossen, John WA","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5afe948e33645324e3fb0fe4e4d27b1bba317364.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1550925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","conventional methods","real-time PCR technique","PICU patients","aetiology of lower respiratory tract infections","conventional viral tests","positive results","tertiary PICU","parainfluenzavirus","young children","rhinoviruses","adenoviruses","positive sample","total","human metapneumovirus","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydia pneumoniae","viral culture","reliable method","diagnostic yield","diagnostic study","human coronaviruses OC43","NL63","immunofluorescence","paediatric intensive care unit","years","CONCLUSION","Samples","INTRODUCTION","winter season","addition"],"language":"en"},

Many subsequent papers have addressed its impact on health service utilization, but few have considered palliative (hospice) care. The aim of the present study was to describe changes in hospice inpatient utilization during and after the SARS epidemic in 2003 in Taiwan. METHODS: The data sources were the complete datasets of inpatient admissions during 2002 and 2003 from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Before-and-after comparisons of daily and monthly utilizations were made. Hospice analyses were limited to those wards that offered inpatient services throughout these two years. The comparisons were extended to total hospital bed utilization and to patients who were still admitted to hospice wards during the peak period of the SARS epidemic. RESULTS: Only 15 hospice wards operated throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. In 2003, hospice utilization began to decrease in the middle of April, reached a minimum on 25 May, and gradually recovered to the level of the previous November. Hospices showed a more marked reduction in utilization than all hospital beds (e.g. -52.5% vs. -19.9% in May 2003) and a slower recovery with a three-month lag. In total, 566 patients were admitted to hospice wards in May/June 2003, in contrast to 818 in May/June 2002. Gender, age and diagnosis distributions did not differ. CONCLUSION: Hospice inpatient utilization in Taiwan was indeed more sensitive to the emerging epidemic than general inpatient utilization. A well-balanced network with seamless continuity of care should be ensured.","publish_time":"2006-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c6ac6629c8a603c01953ae37469014700102ed8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1559606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","National Health Insurance Research Database"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["hospice utilization","hospice inpatient utilization","hospice wards","Hospice analyses","general inpatient utilization","SARS epidemic","health service utilization","total hospital bed utilization","inpatient services","emerging epidemic","complete datasets of inpatient admissions","patients","Taiwan","hospital beds","comparisons of daily","seamless continuity of care","National Health Insurance Research Database","severe acute respiratory syndrome","impact","changes","peak period","data sources","marked reduction","BACKGROUND","well-balanced network","world","CONCLUSION","present study","slower recovery","three-month lag","Gender","age","diagnosis distributions","monthly utilizations","turmoil","subsequent papers","aim","half","METHODS","Hospices","years","middle","RESULTS","level","minimum","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the other molecular events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention. METHODS: Nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cDNAs were hybridized using RNA samples originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis. A supervised clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles. In addition, specific genes were selected and their preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: From the statistical analysis, 310 differentially expressed genes were identified. Among those genes, 90 were up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. After clustering analysis, 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns were kept for further analysis. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed a strong up-regulation of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 (aqp4) and pendrin (slc26). In addition, a dramatic up-regulation of vasotocin (avt) gene was observed. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), coagulation factor V (cf5), adam 22, and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp up-regulation at the time of oocyte maturation. Finally, ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) exhibited a dramatic down-regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down-regulation of Cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation. CONCLUSION: We showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes, most of them being previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary. Our data confirmed the down-regulation of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period. In addition, the strong up-regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring at that time. Furthermore, among the most up-regulated clones, several genes such as cxcl14, ace2, adam22, cf5 have pro-inflammatory, vasodilatory, proteolytics and coagulatory functions. The identity and expression patterns of those genes support the theory comparing ovulation to an inflammatory-like reaction.","publish_time":"2006-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bobe, Julien; Montfort, Jer\u00F4me; Nguyen, Thaovi; Fostier, Alexis","journal":"Reprod Biol Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94be6e5f47cbef1a762c2cb3c1f37d4862b53403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1570352.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570352/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["slc26 genes","specific genes","time of oocyte maturation","regulation of estrogen synthesis genes","chemokine cxcl14 genes","water transport genes","regulation of aqp4","regulation of ion","regulation of vasotocin","statistical analysis","preovulatory ovarian expression","hormonal control of oocyte maturation","real-time PCR analysis","ovulation","post-vitellogenesis","supervised clustering analysis","addition","oocyte hydration process","remarkable expression patterns","regulation of Cytidine monophosphate-N","gene clusters","preovulatory period","molecular mechanisms of nuclear maturation","similar expression profiles","fish preovulatory ovary","late vitellogenesis","cf5","ace2","ovarian tissue","post-vitellogenic period","ovarian aromatase","regulated clones","molecular events","rainbow trout cDNAs","acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase","participation","RNA samples","Nylon microarrays","proteolytics","cmah","coagulation factor V","aquaporin","adam22","order","theory","coagulatory functions","METHODS","enzyme","pendrin","BACKGROUND","cyp19a1","avt","identity","opposite pattern","contrast","reaction","attention","RESULTS","angiotensin","data","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

To improve the outcome of ARDS, accurate diagnosis is essential to the application of effective early treatment. The present study investigated the clinical effects and safety of open lung biopsy (OLB) in patients with early-stage ARDS of suspected non-infectious origin. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 41 patients with early-stage ARDS (defined as one week or less after intubation) who underwent OLB in two medical intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital from 1999 to 2005. Data analyzed included baseline characteristics, complication rate, pathological diagnoses, treatment alterations, and hospital survival. RESULTS: The age of patients was 55 \u00B1 17 years (mean \u00B1 SD). The average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 116 \u00B1 43 mmHg (mean \u00B1 SD) at biopsy. Seventeen patients (41%) were immunocompromised. Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of patients (8/41). All biopsies provided a pathological diagnosis with a diagnostic yield of 100%. Specific pathological diagnoses were made for 44% of patients (18/41). Biopsy findings led to an alteration of treatment modality in 73% of patients (30/41). The treatment alteration rate was higher in patients with nonspecific diagnoses than in patients with specific diagnoses (p = 0.0024). Overall mortality was 50% (21/41) and was not influenced by age, gender, pre-OLB oxygenation, complication rate, pathological results, and alteration of treatment. There was no surgery-related mortality. The survival rate for immunocompromised patients was better than that for immunocompetent patients (71% versus 33%; p = 0.0187) in this study. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that OLB was a useful and acceptably safe diagnostic procedure in some selected patients with early-stage ARDS.","publish_time":"2006-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, Kuo-Chin; Tsai, Ying-Huang; Wu, Yao-Kuang; Chen, Ning-Hung; Hsieh, Meng-Jer; Huang, Shiu-Feng; Huang, Chung-Chi","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0f8a4eef924cdeeeb5b17ae685760bf7cce9223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1751007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1751007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","OLB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age of patients","immunocompromised patients","selected patients","immunocompetent patients","treatment alteration rate","complication rate","survival rate","Specific pathological diagnoses","pathological diagnosis","outcome of ARDS","pathological results","high mortality rate","treatment alterations","alteration of treatment modality","retrospective study","application of effective early treatment","nonspecific diagnoses","early-stage ARDS of suspected non-infectious origin","present study","pre-OLB oxygenation","hospital survival","Biopsy findings","mean","SD","Overall mortality","tertiary care hospital","surgery-related mortality","safety of open lung biopsy","accurate diagnosis","diagnostic yield","inspired oxygen","safe diagnostic procedure","medical intensive care units","average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen","rapid progressive change","heterogeneous etiologies","clinical effects","included baseline characteristics","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","gender","INTRODUCTION","PaO","Data","week","years","FiO","intubation","mmHg","METHODS","CONCLUSION","biopsies","Postoperative complications"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of a virus-positive respiratory sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group. RESULTS: Forty-five viruses were isolated in 41/187 (22%) patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8\u20135.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3\u20136.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3\u20135.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096\u20130.777; P \u003C 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.

The farmers were asked to collect faecal samples from each heifer calf that had diarrhoea between birth and 90 days of age, and also from a healthy calf of the same age. In total, 270 samples were collected and analysed. C. parvum, either alone or together with G. intestinalis and/or rotavirus, was detected in 16 (11%) and 6 (5%) of the samples from diarrhoeic and healthy calves, respectively. Even though a higher proportion of diarrhoeic calves shed C. parvum, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.067), possibly due to the low number of positive samples. G. intestinalis was found in 42 (29%) of the diarrhoea samples and in 29 (23%) of the samples from healthy calves. Rotavirus and coronavirus were demonstrated in 24% and 3% of the diarrhoea samples, respectively, whereas E. coli K99\u002B was only found in samples from 2 healthy calves. C. parvum and G. intestinalis were found in samples from calves 7 to 84 days of age and during all seasons. The results confirm that C. parvum is present in Swedish dairy herds and might have clinical significance. G. intestinalis was the most common agent found but the importance of this parasite remains unclear. Both parasites have suggested zoonotic potential and thus warrant further attention. In addition, rotavirus is a major pathogen in neonatal enteritis in Sweden, whereas coronavirus and E. coli K99\u002B seem to be of less importance.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bj\u00F6rkman, C; Svensson, C; Christensson, B; de Verdier, K","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c905423410ad459a067d65c11efbb89fa196d751.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1831560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrhoea samples","healthy calves","faecal samples","rotavirus","Swedish dairy calves","coronavirus","Giardia intestinalis","healthy calf","low number of positive samples","significance of Cryptosporidium parvum","higher proportion of diarrhoeic calves","days of age","Escherichia coli K99","Swedish dairy herds","importance","clinical significance","heifer calf","comparison","major pathogen","Sweden","neonatal enteritis","birth","groups","presence","zoonotic potential","addition","common agent","difference","parasites","attention","study","results","seasons","farmers","objective","total"],"language":"en"},

To improve resolution of such phylogenies we propose using insertion and deletion (indel) information in addition to substitution information. We accomplish this through joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny in a Bayesian framework, drawing inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps biases that stem from conditioning on a single alignment by taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal alignments. RESULTS: We introduce a novel Markov chain transition kernel that improves computational efficiency by proposing non-local topology rearrangements and by block sampling alignment and topology parameters. In addition, we extend our previous indel model to increase biological realism by placing indels preferentially on longer branches. We demonstrate the ability of indel information to increase phylogenetic resolution in examples drawn from within-host viral sequence samples. We also demonstrate the importance of taking alignment uncertainty into account when using such information. Finally, we show that codon-based substitution models can significantly affect alignment quality and phylogenetic inference by unrealistically forcing indels to begin and end between codons. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that indel information can improve phylogenetic resolution of recently diverged pathogens and that alignment uncertainty should be considered in such analyses.","publish_time":"2007-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Redelings, Benjamin D; Suchard, Marc A","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e0851aa892c56090edbc47e9506313d2a1b20e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1853084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1853084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alignment uncertainty","alignment quality","single alignment","joint estimation of alignment","substitution information","block sampling alignment","phylogenetic resolution","phylogenetic inference","phylogeny","account","indels","Phylogenies","addition","RESULTS","topology parameters","Markov chain Monte Carlo","diverged pathogens","evolving pathogens","novel Markov chain transition kernel","non-local topology rearrangements","codon-based substitution models","computational efficiency","Bayesian framework","examples","biological realism","ensemble of near","conditioning","deletion","biases","host viral sequence samples","optimal alignments","small number of substitutions","short times","BACKGROUND","insertion","importance","longer branches","divergence","end","codons","ability","CONCLUSION","analyses"],"language":"en"},

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of the human IFN-\u03B3 gene can putatively influence the secretion of cytokine with an impact on infection outcome as demonstrated for tuberculosis and other complex diseases. Our aim was to investigate the putative association of IFNG\u002B874T/A SNP with American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) and also the influence of this SNP in the secretion of IFN-\u03B3 in vitro. METHODS: Brazilian ATL patients (78 cutaneous, CL, and 58 mucosal leishmaniasis, ML) and 609 healthy volunteers were evaluated. The genotype of \u002B874 region in the IFN-\u03B3 gene was carried out by Amplification Refractory Mutational System (ARMS-PCR). Leishmania-induced IFN-\u03B3 production on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: There are no differences between \u002B874T/A SNP frequency in cases and controls or in ML versus CL patients. Cutaneous leishmaniasis cases exhibiting AA genotype produced lower levels of IFN-\u03B3 than TA/TT genotypes. In mucosal cases, high and low IFN-\u03B3 producers were clearly demonstrated but no differences in the cytokine production was observed among the IFNG \u002B874T or A carriers. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that \u002B874T/A polymorphism was not associated with either susceptibility or severity to leishmaniasis. Despite this, IFNG \u002B874T/A SNP could be involved in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis by influencing the amount of cytokine released by CL patients, although it could not prevent disease development. On the other hand, it is possible that in ML cases, other potential polymorphic regulatory genes such as TNF-\u03B1 and IL-10 are also involved thus interfering with IFN-\u03B3 secretion.","publish_time":"2007-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matos, Guilherme Inoc\u00EAncio; Covas, Claudia de J Fernandes; Bittar, Rita de C\u00E1ssia; Gomes-Silva, Adriano; Marques, Fabiana; Maniero, Viviane C; Amato, Valdir S; Oliveira-Neto, Manoel P; Mattos, Marise da Silva; Pirmez, Claude; Sampaio, Elizabeth P; Moraes, Milton O; Da-Cruz, Alda Maria","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5ec3d4854fa2bfba10cae487ea5271ed00a24fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1878480.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1878480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","ATL","ELISA","TA/TT","IFNG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B3 secretion","secretion of IFN","human IFN-\u03B3 gene","low IFN-\u03B3 producers","Cutaneous leishmaniasis cases","Leishmania-induced IFN-\u03B3 production","secretion of cytokine","mucosal leishmaniasis","lower levels of IFN","cytokine production","mucosal cases","SNP frequency","pathogenesis of leishmaniasis","key cytokine","American tegumentary leishmaniasis","Brazilian ATL patients","differences","RESULTS","influence","putative association of IFNG","AA genotype","single nucleotide polymorphism","peripheral blood mononuclear cell","PBMC","culture supernatants","Amplification Refractory Mutational System","potential polymorphic regulatory genes","TNF-\u03B1","protective responses","ARMS-PCR","tuberculosis","Interferon-gamma","infection outcome","impact","controls","region","intron","intracellular pathogens","TT genotypes","METHODS","susceptibility","complex diseases","BACKGROUND","aim","ELISA","severity","carriers","healthy volunteers","disease development","hand","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

New methods that improve the overall detection capabilities of these systems can have a broad practical impact. Furthermore, most current generation surveillance systems are vulnerable to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in the health-care data that they monitor. These shifts can occur during major public events, such as the Olympics, as a result of population surges and public closures. Shifts can also occur during epidemics and pandemics as a result of quarantines, the worried-well flooding emergency departments or, conversely, the public staying away from hospitals for fear of nosocomial infection. Most surveillance systems are not robust to such shifts in health-care utilization, either because they do not adjust baselines and alert-thresholds to new utilization levels, or because the utilization shifts themselves may trigger an alarm. As a result, public-health crises and major public events threaten to undermine health-surveillance systems at the very times they are needed most. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this challenge, we introduce a class of epidemiological network models that monitor the relationships among different health-care data streams instead of monitoring the data streams themselves. By extracting the extra information present in the relationships between the data streams, these models have the potential to improve the detection capabilities of a system. Furthermore, the models\u0027 relational nature has the potential to increase a system\u0027s robustness to unpredictable baseline shifts. We implemented these models and evaluated their effectiveness using historical emergency department data from five hospitals in a single metropolitan area, recorded over a period of 4.5 y by the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance real-time public health\u2013surveillance system, developed by the Children\u0027s Hospital Informatics Program at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology on behalf of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We performed experiments with semi-synthetic outbreaks of different magnitudes and simulated baseline shifts of different types and magnitudes. The results show that the network models provide better detection of localized outbreaks, and greater robustness to unpredictable shifts than a reference time-series modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated network models of epidemiological data streams and their interrelationships have the potential to improve current surveillance efforts, providing better localized outbreak detection under normal circumstances, as well as more robust performance in the face of shifts in health-care utilization during epidemics and major public events.","publish_time":"2007-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reis, Ben Y; Kohane, Isaac S; Mandl, Kenneth D","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe8ae98f3112f0ecf862177dd5745232b9d1f966.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1896205.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1896205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hospital Informatics Program","Massachusetts Department of Public Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health-surveillance systems","public-health crises","unpredictable shifts","health-care utilization","different health-care data streams","Massachusetts Department of Public Health","face of shifts","major public events","unpredictable baseline shifts","public closures","public staying","Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance real-time public health","integrated network models of epidemiological data streams","current generation surveillance systems","Advanced disease-surveillance systems","current surveillance efforts","better detection of localized outbreaks","class of epidemiological network models","potential","historical emergency department data","overall detection capabilities","Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences","better localized outbreak detection","early detection of infectious disease outbreaks","new utilization levels","hospitals","semi-synthetic outbreaks of different magnitudes","different types","epidemics","result of quarantines","New methods","result of population surges","simulated baseline","greater robustness","system\u0027s robustness","robust performance","flooding emergency departments","Technology","behalf","Children\u0027s Hospital Informatics Program","normal circumstances","reference time-series modeling approach","alert-thresholds","effectiveness","interrelationships","bioterrorist attacks","period","single metropolitan area","experiments","BACKGROUND","Olympics","fear of nosocomial infection","extra information present","baselines","models\u0027 relational nature","broad practical impact","pandemics","CONCLUSIONS","challenge","FINDINGS","results","times","alarm"],"language":"en"},

The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR\u03B32). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(\u002B )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(\u002B )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(\u002B )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(\u002B )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPAR\u03B32 expression in either ON(\u002B )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group. CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated osteonecrosis development.","publish_time":"2007-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheng, Hui H; Zhang, Ge G; Cheung, Wing Hoi WH; Chan, Chun Wai CW; Wang, Yi Xiang YX; Lee, Kwong Man KM; Wang, Hong Fu HF; Leung, Kwok Sui KS; Qin, Ling L","journal":"J Orthop Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/296e24d0dc3c17633eeffea57bd23e968a1c8a5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2146995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2146995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SON group","sub-single-lesion group","sub-multiple-lesion group","lipid deposition area","Increased bone marrow lipid deposition","close association","elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells","marrow fat cells number","steroid-associated osteonecrosis development","perfusion function","ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs","fat metabolism","fat cell size","quantifying fat cell number","adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs","Local intra-osseous perfusion index","local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation","regard","bilateral femora","hypothesis","rabbits","adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2","PPAR\u03B32 expression","mRNA level","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","important role","abnormalities","occurrence","Dynamic-MRI","weeks","induction","extension","lesions","rabbit model","present study","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","findings","established protocol"],"language":"en"},

These analyses on residues L447 and I449, both in intact F protein and in 6HB, suggest a metamorphic region around these residues with dual structural roles. Mutation of L447 and I449 to aliphatic residues destabilizes the 6HB structure and attenuates fusion activity.

During the first months of 2006, Turkey experienced its first human avian influenza epidemic. A total of 21 human cases were identified, 12 of which were confirmed by the National Institute for Medical Research. Nine of the cases, including the four fatal ones, were from the Dogubeyazit-Van region. This study aims to evaluate the efforts at the avian influenza outbreak control in the Van-Dogubeyazit region in 2006 through the experiences of health personnel. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who took active roles during the avian influenza outbreak in East Turkey during the first months of 2006. We gathered information about the initial responses, the progress and management of the outbreak control, and the reactions of the health professionals and the public. The findings of the study are reported according to the topics that appeared through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Following the first suspected avian influenza cases, a Van Crisis Coordination Committee was formed as the coordinating and decision-making body and played an important role in the appropriate timing of decisions. The health and agriculture services could not be well coordinated owing to the lack of integrated planning in preparation for outbreak and of integrated surveillance programs. Traditional poultry practice together with the low socio-economic status of the people and the lack of health care access in the region seemed to be a major risk for animal to animal and animal to human transmission. The strengths and weaknesses of the present health system \u2013 primary health care services, national surveillance and notification systems, human resource and management \u2013 affected the inter organizational coordination during the outbreak. Open communication between the government and the public played an important part in overcoming difficulties. CONCLUSION: Although there were problems during the avian influenza outbreak in Turkey, the rapid responses of the central and regional health authorities and the performance of the health workers were the key points in controlling the epidemic. The lessons from this outbreak should provide an opportunity for integrating the preparation plans of the health and agricultural organizations, and for revising the surveillance system and enhancing the role of the primary health care services in controlling epidemic disease. Developing successful strategies based on knowledge and experience may play a valuable role in delaying an avian influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarikaya, Ozlem; Erbaydar, Tugrul","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5624758abca389271c4fec49a2861031b4ce19ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2211309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institute for Medical Research","Van Crisis Coordination Committee"],"locations":["East Turkey","Turkey"],"keyphrases":["public health","health workers","health professionals","avian influenza outbreak control","human avian influenza epidemic","avian influenza pandemic","primary health care services","present health system","suspected avian influenza cases","regional health authorities","experiences of health personnel","lack of health care access","human cases","animal","Dogubeyazit-Van region","Van-Dogubeyazit region","national surveillance","important role","surveillance system","human resource","human transmission","management","valuable role","agriculture services","integrated surveillance programs","East Turkey","epidemic disease","study","months","Van Crisis Coordination Committee","lack of integrated planning","rapid responses","preparation plans","key informants","initial responses","National Institute","key points","organizational coordination","major risk","higher risk of death","notification systems","people","active roles","low socio-economic status","coordinated owing","progress","performance","efforts","thematic analysis","knowledge","Traditional poultry practice","in-depth interviews","coordinating","government","decision-making body","weaknesses","agricultural organizations","reactions","problems","BACKGROUND","appropriate timing of decisions","interview transcripts","successful strategies","topics","Medical Research","fatal ones","strengths","opportunity","Open communication","overcoming difficulties","METHODS","information","RESULTS","total","severe illness","CONCLUSION","findings","lessons"],"language":"en"},

Here we present a rapid and high-throughput screening method to study the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). Six target amino acid positions flanking the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) cleavage site were investigated. Each batch of mixed peptide substrates with defined amino acid substitutions at the target amino acid position was synthesized via the \u201Ccartridge replacement\u201D approach and was subjected to enzymatic cleavage by recombinant SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). Susceptibility of each peptide substrate to SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) cleavage was monitored simultaneously by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The hydrophobic pocket in the P2 position at the protease cleavage site is crucial to SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)-specific binding, which is limited to substitution by hydrophobic residue. The binding interface of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) that is facing the P1\u2032 position is suggested to be occupied by acidic amino acids, thus the P1\u2032 position is intolerant to acidic residue substitution, owing to electrostatic repulsion. Steric hindrance caused by some bulky or \u03B2-branching amino acids in P3 and P2\u2032 positions may also hinder the binding of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). This study generates a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) substrate specificity, which serves as the design basis of synthetic peptide-based SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitors. Our experimental approach is believed to be widely applicable for investigating the substrate specificity of other proteases in a rapid and high-throughput manner that is compatible for future automated analysis.","publish_time":"2006-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Ling-Hon Matthew; Choy, Wai-Yan; Tsai, Sau-Na; Rao, Zihe; Ngai, Sai-Ming","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59a1ab84b37fa6475a377f4df329af8cb7521804.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2242481.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1110/ps.052007306","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant SARS-CoV","binding of SARS","substrate specificity of SARS","binding interface of SARS","comprehensive overview of SARS","design basis of synthetic peptide-based SARS-CoV","anti-SARS drug development","target amino acid positions","acidic amino acids","P2 position","protease cleavage site","defined amino acid substitutions","enzymatic cleavage","promising target","acidic residue substitution","P1","hydrophobic residue","specific binding","study","high-throughput manner","batch of mixed peptide substrates","high-throughput screening method","hydrophobic pocket","experimental approach","flight mass spectrometry","ionization time","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","P3","extensive proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins","MALDI-TOF MS","laser desorption","future automated analysis","matrix","proteases","electrostatic repulsion","Susceptibility","Steric hindrance","cartridge replacement","inhibitors"],"language":"en"},

Ten nurses who had suffered from SARS were interviewed, either face\u2010to\u2010face or by telephone, about their subjective experiences. These interviews provided in\u2010depth, descriptive data, which were analysed using content analysis. Nine broad categories were identified: uncertainty, information control, feelings of anger and guilt, lack of preparation and fear of death, feelings of isolation and loneliness, physical effects, support, change of perspective of life, and change of perspective of nursing. Although the dreaded disease affected the nurses tremendously, both physically and psychologically, it has also had its positive side. As a result of experiencing the illness, the participants came to treasure relationships, health and everyday life more. In caring for patients, they came to see the world more from the perspective of the patients.

When compared with a randomly selected control group of 70 dogs (presented for reasons other than IMHA) over the same period, the distribution of cases versus time since vaccination was different (P \u003C .05).

The dogs with IMHA were divided into 2 groups based on time since vaccination: the vaccine IMHA group included dogs vaccinated within 1 month of developing IMHA; the nonvaccine IMHA group included dogs that developed IMHA more than 1 month after vaccination. The recently vaccinated dogs with IMHA (vaccine IMHA group) had significantly lower platelet counts (P \u003C .05) and a trend towards increased prevalence of intravascular hemolysis and autoagglutination when compared with the nonvaccine IMHA group. Similar mortality rates were seen in the vaccine IMHA group (60%) and the nonvaccine IMHA group (44%), with the majority of fatalities (\u003E75%) occurring in the first 3 weeks after presentation. Persistent autoagglutination was a negative prognostic indicator for survival in both groups (P \u003C .05). Presence of icterus and hyperbilirubinemia were negative prognostic indicators for survival in the nonvaccine IMHA group (P \u003C .0001 and P \u003C .01, respectively) but not in the vaccine IMHA group. In the recently vaccinated dogs, combination vaccines from various manufacturers against canine distemper, adenovirus type 2, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus (DHLPP) were involved in each case.

We report the use of DNAzyme (catalytic DNA) to target the 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) of a highly conserved fragment in the SARS genome as an approach to suppression of SARS\u2010CoV replication. A mono\u2010DNA enzyme (Dz\u2010104) possessing the 10\u201323 catalytic motif was synthesized and tested both in vitro and in cell culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS\u2010CoV total RNA was isolated, extracted from the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010WHU strain and converted into cDNA. We designed a RNA\u2010cleaving 10\u201323 DNAzyme targeting at the loop region of the 5\u2032UTR of SARS\u2010CoV. The designed DNAzyme, Dz\u2010104, and its mutant version, Dz\u2010104 (mut), as a control consist of 9 \u002B 9 arm sequences with a 10\u201323 catalytic core. In vitro cleavage was performed using an in vitro transcribed 5\u2032UTR RNA substrate. A vector containing a fused 5\u2032UTR and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was co\u2010transfected with the DNAzyme into E6 cells and the cells expressing eGFP were visualized with fluorescence microscopy and analyzed by fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that this DNAzyme could efficiently cleave the SARS\u2010CoV RNA substrate in vitro and inhibit the expression of the SARS\u2010CoV 5\u2032UTR\u2010eGFP fusion RNA in mammalian cells. This work presents a model system to rapidly screen effective DNAzymes targeting SARS and provides a basis for potential therapeutic use of DNA enzymes to combat the SARS infection.

DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology and a case\u2010control study. SETTING: Two nursing homes (140 beds and 254 beds in nursing homes A and B, respectively) located in southern Ontario, Canada, experiencing outbreaks of respiratory tract infection in July and August 1994. SUBJECTS: Case\u2010residents of the two nursing homes who met clinical and laboratory criteria for Legionella infection. Control\u2010residents were defined as those who were in the homes during the outbreaks and were asymptomatic. MEASUREMENTS: Active surveillance was conducted in both nursing homes to identify symptomatic residents. Residents with fever or respiratory tract symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella. Chest X\u2010rays were performed, and an attempt was made to obtain blood and sputum cultures. Water samples from shower heads, faucets, and air conditioning units were collected for Legionella culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A case\u2010control study was done to assess possible risk factors for legionellosis. RESULTS: Twenty\u2010nine cases \u2014 17 in nursing home A; 12 in nursing home B \u2014 were identified. Four (14%) case\u2010residents had documented pneumonia and four case\u2010residents died. Univariate analysis revealed that a history of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0\u20135.3)), eating pureed food (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6\u201312.7)), and having fluids administered with medication (OR 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0\u20135.9)) were significant risk factors. Cases were less likely to wear dentures (OR .4 (95% CI, .2\u2010.9)) or to eat solid food (OR .3, (95% CI, .1\u2010.6)). Only eating pureed food remained significant in a multivariable analysis (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6\u201313.0, P = .01)). CONCLUSION: This report describes outbreaks of legionellosis in two nursing homes, representing the first reported outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi. The association with illness of dietary characteristics indicative of swallowing disorders suggests that aspiration was the most likely mode of infection. The diagnosis of legionellosis should be considered during outbreaks of respiratory infection in nursing homes.

Published case reports describe a diversity of clinical presentations with confusing terminology and diagnostic criteria as a consequence of the assumption that MRD in cats are analogous to those in dogs or humans. Objective: The aim of the study was to describe clinical, clinicopathologic and imaging findings, response to treatment, survival and possible associations with other diseases or vaccination in a large case series. A priori hypotheses were that cats with MRD commonly present with extramedullary involvement and uncommonly have radiographic bone lesions, in contrast to human patients. Animals:Twenty\u2010four cats with MRD confirmed by cytology or histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Method: A multicenter retrospective study was performed. Results:Two types of clinical presentation were observed. The first group (n = 17) had neoplasia involving abdominal organs, bone marrow, or both. All developed systemic clinical signs and paraproteinemia. Five of 7 cats that received chemotherapy improved clinically or had decreased serum globulin concentration (median survival, 12.3 months; range, 8.5\u201322 months). The second group comprised 7 cats with skin masses, 2 of which were paraproteinemic and developed rapidly worsening systemic signs. In cats without systemic signs, excision of the skin masses appeared to be associated with prolonged survival (up to 2.4 years). Cats with MRD commonly presented with extramedullary involvement (67%), versus humans with MRD (5%) (P \u003C .001), and uncommonly presented with radiographic bone lesions (8%) versus humans with MRD (80%) (P \u003C .001). Conclusions: Radiographic bone lesions are uncommon in cats with MRD and extramedullary presentation is common, relative to human myeloma.","publish_time":"2008-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mellor, Paul J.; Haugland, Sean; Murphy, Sue; Smith, Ken C.; Holloway, Andrew; Archer, Joy; Powell, Roger M.; Polton, Gerry A.; Tasker, Severine; McCormick, David; Tempest, Michelle E.; McNeil, Pauline E.; Scase, Timothy J.; Knott, Chris D.; Bonfanti, Ugo; Villiers, Elizabeth J.; Argyle, David J.; Herrtage, Michael E.; Day, Michael J.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6981e9c5b5faebe4fa30fe19d0bb34eb36aa755.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRD","cats","radiographic bone lesions","systemic clinical signs","humans","extramedullary presentation","extramedullary involvement","bone marrow","types of clinical presentation","worsening systemic signs","diversity of clinical presentations","median survival","prolonged survival","human myeloma","skin masses","months","group","human patients","Published case reports","large case series","multicenter retrospective study","confusing terminology","vaccination","diagnostic criteria","treatment","response","diseases","possible associations","imaging findings","related disorders","neoplasia","consequence","clinicopathologic","assumption","contrast","excision","serum globulin concentration","rare neoplasms of plasma cells","abdominal organs","range","paraproteinemic","cytology","Conclusions","Method","Background","histopathology","Results","dogs","paraproteinemia","immunohistochemistry","Objective","aim","years","chemotherapy","hypotheses","Animals"],"language":"en"},

During the acute stage of neurologic disease following intracerebral inoculation, Junin antigen was detected in 100% of animals, strongly in most neurons but also to a much lesser degree in scattered astrocytes, dropping to 20% of rats at 540 days postinfection. Initially labeled in all brain areas, viral antigen gradually disappeared from hippocampus but persisted irregularly in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Purkinje cells, pons, and medulla oblongata. Such a pattern suggests that specific neuronal subpopulations, in spite of apparently unaltered cell morphology, may persistently harbor the virus, leading on occasion to a delayed neurologic syndrome. During both the acute and chronic stages of disease, a mild inflammatory exudate was observed, characterized by the presence of T and B lymphocytes, as well as macrophages and unidentified round cells. GFAP immunostaining showed increased astrocytic reaction as infection lapsed into chronicity. Corpus callosum, hippocampus, and cerebellum exhibited the sharpest reactive astrocytosis, followed by basal ganglia, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in cerebral cortex it was considerably less. Astrocyte activation, which failed to correlate with viral antigen presence in neurons, seems to result from a generalized condition, possibly including diffusible brain factors triggered by viral infection. Such widespread astroglial reaction may thus contribute to the outcome of the late neurologic syndrome.","publish_time":"2005-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lascano, Eduardo F.; Berr\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa I.; Avila, Mar\u00EDa M.; Weissenbacher, Mercedes C.","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f88dc2955b85dd3203612a6ecae7715257e22e86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAP","GFAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Junin antigen","viral infection","viral antigen presence","Junin virus antigen distribution","basal ganglia","increased astrocytic reaction","prolonged infection","pons","rat brain","acute stage of neurologic disease","medulla oblongata","brain areas","cerebral cortex","hippocampus","delayed neurologic syndrome","late neurologic syndrome","neurons","diffusible brain factors","widespread astroglial reaction","Purkinje cells","presence of T","chronic stages of disease","unidentified round cells","intracerebral inoculation","spite","cerebellum","macrophages","sharpest reactive astrocytosis","GFAP immunostaining","specific neuronal subpopulations","B lymphocytes","mild inflammatory exudate","occasion","outcome","unaltered cell morphology","lesser degree","generalized condition","scattered astrocytes","pattern","Corpus callosum","PAP technique","chronicity","rats","days postinfection","Astrocyte activation","animals"],"language":"en"},

Material and locations The extant fern taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the South Atlantic. Methods The number of taxa in each area or operational geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non\u2010metric multi\u2010dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and compared with \u03B2\u2010turnover and inter\u2010OGU distances. Results OGU area, elevation and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain. Main conclusions The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges. These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea\u2010Congolian thermophilous, cold\u2010tolerant Afro\u2010montane, and Southern drought\u2010tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.","publish_time":"2004-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aldasoro, J.

We aimed to describe the distribution of RV species and associations between RV species and clinical features in children hospitalized with clinically severe pneumonia (CSP) in Morocco. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 700 children, 2\u201359 months of age, admitted with CSP to the H\u00F4pital d\u0027Enfants de Rabat in Morocco. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 92% of children, of which RV was the most common (53%). PCR assays, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree analyses were carried out on 183 RV\u2010positive NPAs to determine RV species and genotypes. Of 157 successfully genotyped NPAs, 60 (38.2%) were RV\u2010A, 8 (5.1%) were RV\u2010B, and 89 (56.7%) were RV\u2010C. Wheezing and cyanosis were more common in RV\u2010C\u2010positive than RV\u2010A\u2010positive children (80.9% vs. 56.7%; P = 0.001 for wheezing and 10.1% vs. 0%; P = 0.011 for cyanosis).

Clinically, ribavirin has been used effectively in persons primarily to treat life\u2010threatening viral diseases such as acute haemorrhagic fever or viral pneumonia of infants. In order to evaluate the feasibility of using this antiviral agent in cats, the effects of oral (p.o.), intramuscular (i.m.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses of ribavirin in 27 9\u2010month\u2010old specific\u2010pathogen\u2010free cats were evaluated by haematology, clinical chemistries, bone marrow biopsies and histopathology. Ribavirin was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of either 11, 22, or 44 mg/kg after which all cats were euthanatized and necropsied. Most cats receiving 22 or 44 mg of ribavirin/kg became anorectic and suffered some degree of weight loss (0.2 to 0.6 kg), and about one\u2010third of the cats developed diarrhoea and/or mucous membrane pallor. Icterus or haemorrhage was not observed. The most profound and consistent haemato\u2010logic change, particularly among the moderate and high dosage groups regardless of route of administration, was a significant and severe thrombocytopenia (range, 33\u201378% reduction in mean platelet counts vs. baseline). Other changes, particularly reductions in total WBC and neutrophils and reductions in RBC and PCV, tended to occur at lower ribavirin dosages, but generally they were not statistically significant. Cats given 44 mg of ribavirin/kg i.v. showed significant decreases in leukocyte variables, including total WBC (P = 0.016), neutrophils (P= 0.026) and lymphocytes (P= 0.047). Mild\u2010to\u2010moderate increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities occurred at doses of 22 and 44 mg/kg. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment revealed that cats given 11 mg of ribavirin/kg had mild megakaryocytic (MK) hypoplasia, whereas cats receiving 22 or 44 mg/kg had progressively severe degrees of MK hypoplasia and dysplasia, asynchronous MK maturation, and increased myeloidrerythroid ratio. Pathologic changes in ribavirin\u2010treated cats generally were mild and included primarily enteritis (seven cats) and hepatocellular vacuolation and/or centrilobular necrosis (seven cats). Results of this study in cats indicated that daily administration of ribavirin at a dose range of 11 to 44 mg/kg induced a dose\u2010related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors, and at the higher dosages it suppressed numbers of circulating leukocytes.","publish_time":"2008-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"WEISS, R.

Our results show that during Fc\u03B3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis, CD13 redistributes to the phagocytic cup and is internalized into the phagosomes. Moreover, modified erythrocytes that interact with the monocytic cell membrane through Fc\u03B3RI and CD13 are ingested simultaneously, more efficiently than those that interact through the Fc\u03B3RI only. Also, co\u2010cross\u2010linking of CD13 with Fc\u03B3RI by specific mAbs increases the level and duration of Syk phosphorylation induced by Fc\u03B3RI cross\u2010linking. Finally, Fc\u03B3RI and CD13 colocalize in zones of cellular polarization and coredistribute after aggregation of either of them. These results demonstrate that CD13 and Fc\u03B3RI can functionally interact on the monocytic cell membrane and suggest that CD13 may act as a signal regulator of Fc\u03B3R function.","publish_time":"2005-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mina\u2010Osorio, Paola; Ortega, Enrique","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38a325a5a9cf26495daf81eca0acb09acfc2dd50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13","Fc\u03B3RI cross\u2010linking","monocytic cell membrane","Fc\u03B3Rs","results","functional association","possible functional interactions","signal regulator of Fc\u03B3R function","human peripheral blood monocytes","level","receptors","duration of Syk phosphorylation","specific mAbs","amino acids","immunoglobulin G","zones of cellular polarization","mediated phagocytosis","monoclonal antibodies","cytoplasmic portion","work","bound metalloproteinase","phagocytic cup","promonocytic cells","modified erythrocytes","tissues","aggregation","Aminopeptidase N","phagosomes"],"language":"en"},

The structures of complexes of griffithsin with 1\u21926\u03B1\u2010mannobiose and with maltose were solved and refined at the resolution of 2.0 and 1.5 \u00C5, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of binding of 1\u21926\u03B1\u2010mannobiose, maltose, and mannose to griffithsin were determined. Binding profiles of 1\u21926\u03B1\u2010mannobiose and mannose were similar with K (d) values of 83.3 \u03BCM and 102 \u03BCM, respectively. The binding of maltose to griffithsin was significantly weaker, with a fourfold lower affinity (K (d) = 394 \u03BCM). In all cases the binding at 30\u00B0C was entropically rather than enthalpically driven. On the basis of the experimental crystal structures, as well as on previously determined structures of complexes with monosaccharides, it was possible to create a model of a tridentate complex of griffithsin with Man(9)GlcNAc(2), a high mannose oligosaccharide commonly found on the surface of viral glycoproteins. All shorter oligomannoses could be modeled only as bidentate or monodentate complexes with griffithsin. The ability to mediate tight multivalent and multisite interactions with high\u2010mannose oligosaccharides helps to explain the potent antiviral activity of griffithsin.

Label\u2010free detection techniques monitor biomolecular interactions and simplify the bioassays by eliminating the need for secondary reactants.

Currently, a large proportion of known human USP sequences are not annotated either structurally or functionally, including regions both within and flanking their catalytic cores. To extend the current understanding of human USPs, we applied consensus fold recognition to the unannotated content of the human USP family. The most interesting discovery was the marked presence of reliably predicted ubiquitin\u2010like (UBL) domains in this family of enzymes. The UBL domain thus appears to be the most frequently occurring domain in the human USP family, after the characteristic catalytic domain. The presence of multiple UBL domains per USP protein, as well as of UBL domains embedded in the USP catalytic core, add to the structural complexity currently recognized for many DUBs.

TP promotes tumor growth and metastasis by preventing apoptosis and inducing angiogenesis. Elevated levels of TP are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Therefore, TP inhibitors are synthesized in an attempt to prevent tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. TP is also indispensable for the activation of the extensively used 5\u2010fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine, which is clinically used for the treatment of colon and breast cancer. Clinical trials that combine capecitabine with TP\u2010inducing therapies (such as taxanes or radiotherapy) suggest that increasing TP expression is an adequate strategy to enhance the antitumoral efficacy of capecitabine. Thus, TP plays a dual role in cancer development and therapy: on the one hand, TP inhibitors can abrogate the tumorigenic and metastatic properties of TP; on the other, TP activity is necessary for the activation of several chemotherapeutic drugs. This duality illustrates the complexity of the role of TP in tumor progression and in the clinical response to fluoropyrimidine\u2010based chemotherapy. \u00A9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Emerging concepts in free radical biology are now shedding light on the pathogenesis of various diseases. Free\u2010radical induced pathogenicity in virus infections is of great importance, because evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. Although oxygen radicals and NO have an antimicrobial effect on bacteria and protozoa, they have opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and several other neurotropic virus infections. A high output of NO from inducible NO synthase, occurring in a variety of virus infections, produces highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, such as peroxynitrite, via interaction with oxygen radicals and reactive oxygen intermediates. The production of these various reactive species confers the diverse biological functions of NO. The reactive nitrogen species cause oxidative tissue injury and mutagenesis through oxidation and nitration of various biomolecules. The unique biological properties of free radicals are further illustrated by recent evidence showing accelerated viral mutation by NO\u2010induced oxidative stress. NO appears to affect a host\u0027s immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, NO is reported to suppress type 1 helper T cell\u2010dependent immune responses during infections, leading to type 2 helper T cell\u2010biased immunological host responses. NO\u2010induced immunosuppression may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of virus infections and help expansion of quasispecies population of viral pathogens. This review describes the pathophysiological roles of free radicals in the pathogenesis of viral disease and in viral mutation as related to both nonspecific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO.

The whole procedure is very simple and rapid wherein the amplification can be completed in less than 1 h under isothermal conditions employing a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, by incubating all the reagents in a single tube. Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real\u2010time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real\u2010time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

Public health interventions aimed at improving water, food and sanitation are unlikely adequately to control the disease. The development of vaccines against severe rotavirus diarrhoea is based upon homotypic or heterotypic protection provided against either a single common G serotype (monovalent vaccines) or against multiple serotypes (multivalent vaccines). Rotavirus strain surveillance has a high priority in disease control programmes worldwide. The continued identification of the most common G and P serotypes for inclusion in vaccines is an important priority. And subsequent to the introduction of a vaccine candidate, not only monitoring of circulating strains is recommended, but also surveillance of potential reassortment of animal rotavirus genes from the vaccine into human rotavirus strains is critical. Conventional methods used in the characterisation of rotavirus strains, such as enzyme immunoassay serotyping and reverse\u2010transcription PCR\u2010based genotyping often fail to identify uncommon and newly appearing strains. The application of newer molecular approaches, including sequencing and oligonucleotide microarray hybridisation, may be required to characterise such strains. The present paper presents a brief overview of the variety of standard methods available, followed by suggestions for a systematic approach for routine rotavirus strain surveillance as well as for characterisation of incompletely typed rotavirus strains. Improved detection and characterisation of incompletely typed strains will help to develop a comprehensive strain surveillance that may be required for tailoring effective rotavirus vaccines.

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, despite a high rate of viral infections in the early period, present data suggest a satisfactory infectious profile after T\u2010cell replete haplo\u2010HSCT using post\u2010transplant Cy. These results may help clinicians to improve both prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial strategies in this emerging haploidentical setting.","publish_time":"2015-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crocchiolo, R.; Bramanti, S.; Vai, A.; Sarina, B.; Mineri, R.; Casari, E.; Tordato, F.; Mauro, E.; Timofeeva, I.; Lugli, E.; Mavilio, D.; Carlo\u2010Stella, C.; Santoro, A.; Castagna, L.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd021d5e3273bad9458f4deb31f878632a5e624f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169814.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSCT","fungal infections","year","cumulative incidence of viral infections","high rate of viral infections","post\u2010transplant cyclophosphamide","cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","consecutive recipients of haplo","Cumulative incidence of bacterial","present data","platform of T","high reproducibility","rate of polyomavirus","satisfactory infectious profile","emerging haploidentical setting","acceptable safety profile","invasive fungal infection","therapeutic antimicrobial strategies","early period","months","median follow\u2010up","patients","prospective cohort analysis","various hematologic malignancies","associated cystitis","risk","CMV reactivation","METHOD","clinicians","note","confidence interval","BACKGROUND","days"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, mixed infections caused by atypical and typical pathogens together are common. At this moment rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are lacking. Besides numerous viruses, the main bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonias are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two chlamydial species, Chlamydia pneumoniae and C. psittaci, one rickettsia, Coxiella burnetti, and several Legionella species. The majority of these pathogens cause upper respiratory tract infections more often than overt pneumonias. An atypical agent, Chlamydia pneumoniae, has also been associated with chronic inflammatory conditions in the cardiovascular system. The most recently discovered pathogen in atypical pneumonias is a hantavirus causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.","publish_time":"2014-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saikku, Pekka","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d46761b639873db2cbb2fa367277e3d122b0ce0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["atypical pneumonias","main atypical pathogens","atypical agent","main bacterial pathogens","Chlamydia pneumoniae","overt pneumonias","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","upper respiratory tract infections","mixed infections","chlamydial species","Legionella species","hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","psittaci","Coxiella burnetti","\u03B2-lactam antibiotics","moment rapid","sensitive diagnostic methods","chronic inflammatory conditions","cardiovascular system","aminoglycosides","rickettsia","numerous viruses","basis","selection of proper treatment","discovered pathogen","ability","majority","well-defined clinical entity","microbiological diagnosis","need"],"language":"en"},

To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children.","publish_time":"1991-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sutrisna, B.; Frerichs, R.R.; Reingold, A.L.","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["supportive care","ampicillin treatment","treatment of mild ARI","treatment groups","moderate ARI","severe ARI","ampicillin group","allocated ampicillin","recommended treatment","antibiotic treatment","effect of treatment","control groups","sex","benefit","fever","percentages of cases","mild acute respiratory infections","history of measles immunisation","measles immunisation status","young Indonesian children","terms of age","educational level","week follow-up","level of parental education","randomisation","days","continued breastfeeding","nose","physicians","outcome","years","developing countries","times","controlled trial","progression","body weight","paracetamol","parents","differences","vs"],"language":"en"},

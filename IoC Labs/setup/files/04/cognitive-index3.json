Thus, research about WhatsApp\u2019s influence in general and especially its influence in education was relevant and significant. While there was much research involving WhatsApp and learning, it was not conclusive about the effects of WhatsApp on student learning. Specifically, research focusing on collaborative learning using WhatsApp was lacking, including research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp. Consequently, the paper\u2019s research problem was the lack of research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. To address the research problem, the study followed the important initial and conceptual steps of the instrument development process to develop a research instrument to measure collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. The result of the paper was a developed instrument that provides researchers with a basis to measure the explanatory constructs involved in mobile collaborative learning (MCL) processes on WhatsApp and potentially other social media platforms. Therefore, the paper made an appropriately theoretical contribution, which was grounded in the scientific literature. The study facilitated positivistic research and epistemology for acquiring objective and precise scientific knowledge. Such deductive research promotes theory testing and development and presents educators and students with scientific evidence about learning with MCL applications such as WhatsApp from which both curriculum and learning design can be informed and benefited. In the age of connected mobility this is a necessity.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyembe, Bangisisi Zamuxolo Mathews; Howard, Grant Royd","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e8c6952468e86ea2ed2b6d752668796d14c2eab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WhatsApp"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deductive research","positivistic research","effects of WhatsApp","lack of research instruments","paper\u2019s research problem","student learning","learning design","collaboration","mobile collaborative learning","instrument development process","developed instrument","scientific evidence","study","relation","academic achievement","scientific literature","precise scientific knowledge","social media application","social media platforms","MCL applications","WhatsApp\u2019s influence","conceptual steps","educators","objective","epistemology","processes","explanatory constructs","theory testing","students","education","basis","researchers","curriculum","age of connected mobility","total world\u2019s population","necessity","theoretical contribution","result","active users"],"language":"en"},

Although organisations are acknowledging the emergence of I4.0 and realise the importance of being ready for its impact, better understanding is required of the potential of I4.0 and its holistic impact on organisations. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify all I4.0-related organisational aspects, such as an I4.0-relevant strategy, digital business model innovation, technology investment optimisation, workforce management complexity, digital eco-systems, technology-centric convergence, virtual model and physical environment linkage, value chain digitalisation and product portfolio innovation. Furthermore, we presented these I4.0 organisational aspects identified in a conceptual model based on the components of organisational strategic alignment. By using such a conceptual model, organisations can ensure that both optimisation and new opportunities enabled by I4.0 are leveraged and that a relevant, strategically aligned approach to I4.0 may be considered.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smuts, Stefan; van der Merwe, Alta; Smuts, Hanlie","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57fab8b7dd252f05554673a924df2a14cd791c14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134257.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of I4","emergence of I4","organisations","conceptual model","virtual model","digital business model innovation","related organisational aspects","technology investment optimisation","relevant strategy","components of organisational strategic alignment","holistic impact","new opportunities","technology-centric convergence","digital eco-systems","product portfolio innovation","workforce management complexity","value chain digitalisation","physical environment linkage","better understanding","industrial revolution","Industry","systematic literature review","way","importance","aligned approach","disruptive technologies","paper"],"language":"en"},

It involved a systematic literature review of 101 papers from 53 journals focusing on the publication outlets, yearly trends, themes, and associated theoretical and conceptual approaches, methodologies, sources and geographical distribution of digital entrepreneurship research. The findings suggest that extant literature mostly lacked sound theoretical underpinnings. More work adopting appropriate and proven theoretical approaches is needed. Most of the reviewed papers also focused mainly on issues relating to the technology itself than those relating to the enterprise or the entrepreneur. The capabilities and capacities of enterprises, as well as the strategies in implementing digital technologies and harnessing the opportunities of digitalization, are key issues that have not hitherto received much attention. The study contributes to the understanding of the conceptualization of the digital entrepreneurship phenomenon. Future research should consolidate the understanding of the field, with models and frameworks that recognize digital entrepreneurship as an academic research field in its own right, and also consider the impact of enterprise capabilities and capacities on digital entrepreneurship.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anim-Yeboah, Samuel; Boateng, Richard; Awuni Kolog, Emmanuel; Owusu, Acheampong; Bedi, Ibrahim","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91d7db8f3b293ae1f8ffaf1b06585568fb24958d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital entrepreneurship phenomenon","digital technologies","geographical distribution of digital entrepreneurship research","extant literature","extant contemporary literature","proven theoretical approaches","academic research field","reviewed papers","understanding","Future research","study","sound theoretical underpinnings","systematic literature review","impact of enterprise capabilities","conceptual approaches","peer-reviewed journal articles","capacities of enterprises","key issues","journal databases","sources","themes","methodologies","publication outlets","models","yearly trends","opportunities of digitalization","journals","right","conceptualization","frameworks","years","strategies","findings","technology","attention"],"language":"en"},

This study addresses this gap in the literature by investigating the influence of price comparison websites on online switching behavior, and also suggests some additional factors that may be considered when looking at this relationship. We argue that shopper innovativeness, their perceived usefulness of the ad, and their customer service experience consciousness are important factors to consider when evaluating the impact of price comparison websites on eSwitching behavior. We also argue that the most appropriate theoretical lens through which to investigate this relationship is that of the consumer empowerment paradigm. A conceptual model is proposed and tested. Our analysis of 345 sample respondents finds that perceived usefulness of ads and customer service experience expectations are important enablers to price comparison websites use. Similarly, we find that shopper innovativeness and customer service expectations, in addition to price comparison websites use, are significant enablers to eSwitching behaviour. However, contrary to prediction, we find that shopper innovativeness has little to no influence on shoppers\u2019 use of price comparison websites; we also observed similar patterns concerning the link between the perceived usefulness of online ads and eSwitching behaviour. In conclusion, our research contributes to better understanding the influence of price comparison websites on online switching behavior, and the factors that might influence this relationship.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwarteng, Michael Adu; Jibril, Abdul Bashiru; Botha, Elsamari; Osakwe, Christian Nedu","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ed62b30885fa176a13d48545e8aa68f47c5cddb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["online price comparison websites","influence of price comparison websites","impact of price comparison websites","shoppers\u2019 use of price comparison websites","online switching behavior","online consumer behavior","eSwitching behavior","perceived usefulness of online ads","shopper innovativeness","relationship","customer service expectations","perceived usefulness of ads","customer service experience expectations","important factors","eSwitching behaviour","customer service experience consciousness","important enablers","additional factors","significant enablers","scant understanding","consumer empowerment paradigm","link","sample respondents","literature","similar patterns","prediction","appropriate theoretical lens","study","gap","analysis","research","conceptual model","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

However, in order to assist organisations to create and transfer knowledge more effectively through knowledge visualisation, the aim of this study is to provide a conceptual knowledge visualisation framework for the transfer of knowledge for organisations. A conceptual knowledge visualisation framework was designed through a systematic literature review process where 15 organisational knowledge visualisation elements were identified. The 15 elements were grouped and presented in a 4-layered, embedded conceptual framework that organisations may apply to their knowledge visualisation efforts. By using such a framework, organisations may optimise learning and improve knowledge and skills of its employees.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smuts, Hanlie; Scholtz, Iddo-Imri","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3032eec169798fe218b7e95f52564590b3f15019.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transfer knowledge","transfer of knowledge","complexity of knowledge","relevant knowledge","knowledge visualisation efforts","conceptual knowledge visualisation framework","organisational knowledge visualisation elements","organisations","employees","embedded conceptual framework","skills","order","experiential learning","systematic literature review process","graphical representations","science","technology","world of visual","information","study","Revolutionary advances","volume","aim","reporting structure"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results confirmed that all four UTAUT constructs; performance expectancy (\u201Cthe degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance\u201D), effort expectancy (\u201Cthe degree of ease associated with the use of the system\u201D, social influence (\u201Cthe degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system\u201D) and facilitating conditions (\u201Cthe degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system\u201D), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, Fazlyn; Jacobs, Mariam; Pather, Shaun","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b19f97fc952b93381f0c6bf7c8fcd27432fce8e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa","Western Cape"],"keyphrases":["health acceptance","Use of Technology","health applications","use of devices","health disparity","individual","diabetes self-management","user acceptance","degree of ease","new system","self-management need","availability of free mobile health","Unified Theory of Acceptance","good self-management behaviours","UTAUT constructs","performance expectancy","technology anxiety","study","South Africa","challenges","Western Cape","effort expectancy","key constructs","low socio-economic areas","limited internet access","increasing numbers of diabetic patients","semi-structured interviews","usage","thematic content analysis","technological forms of exclusion","type","resistance","technical infrastructure","social influence","population","populace","Factors","lack of trust","conditions","model","Respondents","gains","research","results","literature","studies","future interventions","Segments","objective"],"language":"en"},

This exploratory study aims to determine the nature of cyber-harassment victimization, its enablers, and the coping mechanisms that online platforms provide to prevent or stop cyber-harassment. An online survey of ninety (n = 90) LGBTQIA\u002B young adults of ages between 18 and 34 from South Africa reveals a high incidence of exclusion, outing and harassment, covering a wide variety of types, duration and experienced severity, taking place through text messaging and social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Most LGBTQIA\u002B youth resort to measures such as blocking, deleting offensive content and adjusting privacy settings to cope with cyber-victimization. Worryingly, the most severe effects of harassment such as depression, drug abuse, self-harm and suicide contemplation, have significant correlations with the harassment type used, harassment duration and harassment frequency.

Traditional methods of testing involve culture techniques to increase the numbers of the organism to a detectable level, followed by isolation and biochemical identification. This chapter focuses on the methodologies to detect pathogens and indicator organisms; however, the methods described are applicable to most bacteria. As detection and isolation methods have improved, a growing number of pathogens have been identified as important food- and waterborne pathogens. This chapter describes the use of nucleic acid and antibody probes that have the potential to circumvent the need to culture the organism prior to identification. Nucleic acid probes have become a valuable diagnostic reagent in the identification of human and animal pathogens and have made possible the identification of viruses and bacteria that are difficult, if not impossible, to cultivate. DNA probes have also proved to be a useful tool for identifying and monitoring the organisms in food and the environment.","publish_time":"2008-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaspar, Charles W.; Tartera, Carmen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148849/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation methods","identification of viruses","animal pathogens","identification of human","waterborne pathogens","developed methods","biochemical identification","detection of bacteria","Nucleic acid probes","antibody probes","Traditional methods of testing","growing number of pathogens","important food","DNA probes","chapter","use of nucleic acid","indicator organisms","culture techniques","valuable diagnostic reagent","detectable level","numbers","methodologies","specific microorganisms","means","potential","microbiologists","need","environment","useful tool"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we contest the dominant approach, which defines scientific literacy in terms of what scientists produce or do. We argue that a more viable approach begins by framing a more general project of (democratic) citizenship and asks what kind of scientific literacy can contribute to this project. The different parts of our argument are illustrated with data from a three-year ethnographic study of science in one community. These data feature adult residents who were dealing with the contested issue of whether or not to extend the existing water main in order to supply with water a part of the community that, at the time, had to rely on seasonally contaminated wells. Irrespective of their science background, these citizens engaged scientists. We argue that educating for citizenship presupposes participation in democratic processes, a stance that has considerable implications for science education.","publish_time":"2004-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roth, Wolff-Michael; D\u00E9sautels, Jacques","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc7fcc2d3bab5a51585be8132b3947525a5dcd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["technological literacy","kind of scientific literacy","concept of scientific literacy","science educators","science education","science background","students\u2019 scientific","citizenship","scientists","community","three-year ethnographic study of science","technological inventions","democratic processes","dominant approach","general project","viable approach","existing water main","data feature adult residents","stance","considerable implications","world","order","participation","New discoveries","argument","primary goal","terms","different parts","article","contested issue","contaminated wells","time"],"language":"en"},

Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government\u2019s support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the \u201Crise of China\u201D argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China\u2019s rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China\u2019s discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since China\u2019s adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.","publish_time":"2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Kejin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afac086b9492b66969c0f1af5c95e804d111cb3c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Communist Party"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China\u2019s discursive power strategy","China\u2019s rise","China\u2019s rapid rise","Communist Party of China","China\u2019s adoption","international affairs","leaders","argument","new political model","new discourse","foreign policy","fundamental principle","domestic affairs","established political order","various international occasions","document reviews","advocating","interviews","attention","Chinese government\u2019s support","mere follower","world\u2019s","causal relationship","motivations","mainstream scholars","government agencies","dominant explanation","century","debate","establishment","opening","world stage","largest economy","regard","paper","tradition","situation"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the viruses causing rinderpest, canine distemper, Newcastle disease, measles, and mumps have arguably caused more morbidity and mortality than any other single group of related viruses in history. The impact of these diseases has been dramatically reduced through the use of vaccines in both humans and animals, in combination with depopulation and restrictions on animal movements for diseases such as rinderpest and Newcastle disease. The history of the paramyxoviruses is replete with incorrect reports that complicate their taxonomic classification and confuses assessment of their true ability to cause interspecies infections. The nomenclature of viruses within the family Paramyxoviridae is confusing and fraught with inconsistencies, as individual viruses have variously been named according to their species of origin, geographic sites of discovery, antigenic relationships, or given names related to the diseases that they produce in affected animals or humans. Paramyxovirus virions are pleomorphic, 150\u2013350 nm in diameter. Virions are enveloped, covered with large glycoprotein spikes, and contain a \u201Cherringbone-shaped\u201D helically symmetrical nucleocapsid, approximately 1 \u03BCm in length and 18 nm (Paramyxovirinae) or 13\u201314 nm (Pneumovirinae) in diameter.

Clinical food intolerance has many causes and many manifestations, including psychological aversion to the sight, smell, or taste of food as well as psychological intolerance to one or more of the many constituents of food. Dietary protein intolerance is the clinical syndrome resulting from the sensitization of an individual to one or more proteins that have been absorbed via a permeable mucosa in the small intestine. Intolerance to various food proteins, especially to cows\u0027 milk, has been recognized in children for many years. Such food intolerance may be the result of a variety of causes\u2014for example, a congenital digestive enzyme defect such as sucrase\u2013isomaltase deficiency or an acquired lactase deficiency secondary to small-intestinal mucosal damage, which in turn can be the result of a food allergy. The incidence of gastrointestinal food allergy diseases is greatest in the first few months and years of an infant\u0027s life and decreases with age. The acute syndrome is usually characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting, after cows\u0027 milk ingestion, occasionally followed by pallor and a shock-like state; however, acute anaphylaxis is rare. Acute abdominal pain seems to be a particular feature of fish hypersensitivity, while peanuts often produce immediate reactions in the oral mucosa as well as abdominal pain.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker-Smith, John","journal":"Diseases of the Small Intestine in Childhood","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151781.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Clinical food intolerance","taste of food","psychological intolerance","constituents of food","various food proteins","dietary protein intolerance","acute syndrome","incidence of gastrointestinal food allergy diseases","Acute abdominal pain","clinical syndrome","result","acute anaphylaxis","years","cows\u0027 milk ingestion","isomaltase deficiency","small intestine","oral mucosa","psychological aversion","variety of causes","permeable mucosa","acquired lactase deficiency secondary","small-intestinal mucosal damage","sucrase","congenital digestive enzyme defect","example","smell","sudden onset of vomiting","particular feature of fish hypersensitivity","infant\u0027s life","pallor","months","sight","turn","state","manifestations","immediate reactions","sensitization","chapter","shock","individual","children"],"language":"en"},

It is possible to genetically manipulate most of the different classes of known viruses in order to produce recombinant viruses that express foreign proteins. Recombinant viruses have been used in gene therapy to deliver selected genes into higher organisms, in vaccinology and immunotherapy, and as important research tools to study the structure and function of these proteins. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome. They have been applied not only as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines but also as vehicles in drug and gene delivery and, more recently, as tools in nanobiotechnology. In this article, basic and advanced features of viruses and VLPs are presented and their major applications are discussed. The different production platforms based on animal cell technology are explained, and their main challenges and future perspectives are explored. The implications of large-scale production of viruses and VLPs are discussed in the context of process control, monitorization, and optimization. The main upstream and downstream technical challenges are identified and discussed accordingly.","publish_time":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rold\u00E3o, A.; Silva, A.C.; Mellado, M.C.M.; Alves, P.M.; Carrondo, M.J.T.","journal":"Comprehensive Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151966.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant viruses","advanced features of viruses","VLPs","different classes of known viruses","implications of large-scale production of viruses","conformation of authentic native viruses","main challenges","different production platforms","gene therapy","gene delivery","technical challenges","foreign proteins","important research tools","immunotherapy","organization","order","higher organisms","selected genes","vaccinology","vehicles","animal cell technology","multiprotein structures","genomes","monitorization","infecting cells","efficient techniques","context of process control","drug","particles","simple biological systems","therapeutic vaccines","viral genome","optimization","future perspectives","function","new copies","major applications","nanobiotechnology"],"language":"en"},

Acute gastroenteritis is a very common diagnosis in pediatric practices. It is usually a clinical diagnosis. Its most common symptoms are acute vomiting and diarrhea. The most important acute complication of gastroenteritis is dehydration, which occurs when the child\u0027s overall output of fluid exceeds input. Insensible water loss is the volume of fluid that leaves the body as a result of the difference in vapor pressure between the skin and lung surfaces and the surrounding atmosphere. The small intestine is the organ principally affected in most children by gastroenteritis but the stomach and colon may also be involved to a varying extent. Most often acute gastroenteritis is a self-limiting illness and may result in full recovery after 24 hours.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker-Smith, John","journal":"Diseases of the Small Intestine in Childhood","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute gastroenteritis","acute vomiting","important acute complication of gastroenteritis","common diagnosis","result","volume of fluid","common symptoms","variable extent","varying extent","clinical diagnosis","child\u0027s overall output of fluid","skin","lung surfaces","vapor pressure","protozoal pathogens","damage","difference","infectious disease","dehydration","severity","input","body","diarrhea","Insensible water loss","surrounding atmosphere","self-limiting illness","organ","alimentary tract","mucosa","stomach","children","pediatric practices","small intestine","recovery"],"language":"en"},

Live probiotic bacteria improve the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, leading to a reduction in pathogen colonization. However, it remains largely unknown how probiotics regulate the host\u0027s immunologic responses and protect the host from parasitic infection. In this study, we addressed whether Bacillales were effective against Haemonchus contortus, a parasitic nematode that infects small ruminants worldwide. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that Bacillales were largely depleted in the abomasal microbiota of sheep infected with H. contortus We constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis named rBS CotB-HcG that express the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of H. contortus (HcGAPDH) on its spore surface using the Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein B (CotB) as a carrier. Mice receiving rBS CotB-HcG orally showed strong Th1-dominated immune responses. More importantly, sheep administered BS CotB-HcG per os showed increasing proliferation of the peripheral blood mononucleates, elevated anti-HcGAPDH IgG in sera, and higher anti-HcGAPDH sIgA in the intestinal mucus than the control sheep. The average weight gain of H. contortus-infected sheep treated with rBS CotB-HcG (Hc\u002BrBS CotB-HcG ) was 48.73% greater than that of unvaccinated sheep. Furthermore, these Hc\u002BrBS CotB-HcG sheep had fewer eggs per gram of feces by 84.1% and adult worms by 71.5%. They also demonstrated greatly lessened abomasal damage by H. contortus with an abundance of probiotic species in the abomasal microbiota. Collectively, our data unequivocally demonstrate the protective roles of CotB-HcGAPDH-expressing B. subtilis spores in against H. contortus infection and showed great potential of using probiotic-based strategy in controlling parasitic nematodes of socioeconomic importance in general.IMPORTANCE Initial analyses of the abomasal microbiota of sheep using 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that probiotic bacteria played a protective role in against H. contortus infection. A recombinant Bacillus subtilis expressing a fusion protein CotB-HcGAPDH on its spore\u0027s surface induced strong Th1 immune response in a murine model. The same probiotic recombinant, upon only one oral application, protected sheep against H. contortus infection by reducing egg shedding and decreasing adult worm loads of the parasite and increasing body weight gain of infected sheep. Both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were evident in these immunized sheep.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yi; Zhang, Guiheng; Wu, Jie; Chen, Xueqiu; Tong, Danni; Yang, Yimin; Shi, Hengzhi; Yao, Chaoqun; Zhuang, Lenan; Wang, Jianbin; Du, Aifang","journal":"mSystems","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00239-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rBS CotB-HcG sheep","contortus-infected sheep","contortus infection","abomasal microbiota of sheep","protected sheep","immunized sheep","control sheep","unvaccinated sheep","Haemonchus contortus","probiotic recombinant","Probiotic Bacillales","fusion protein CotB-HcGAPDH","protective roles of CotB","body weight gain of infected sheep","parasitic infection","recombinant Bacillus subtilis","Live probiotic bacteria","probiotic-based strategy","abundance of probiotic species","subtilis spores","gastrointestinal microbiota","Th2 immune responses","elevated anti-HcGAPDH IgG","higher anti-HcGAPDH sIgA","Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein B","spore surface","S rRNA sequencing","lessened abomasal damage","spore\u0027s surface induced strong Th1 immune response","parasitic nematodes of socioeconomic importance","host\u0027s immunologic responses","average weight gain of","increasing proliferation","adult worms","IMPORTANCE Initial analyses","adult worm loads","peripheral blood mononucleates","sera","intestinal mucus","fewer eggs","parasite","egg shedding","great potential","gram of feces","composition","oral application","murine model","probiotics","reduction","phosphate dehydrogenase of","glyceraldehyde","small ruminants","pathogens","Mice","pathogen colonization","data","carrier","study"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology and determinant of NSSI have not been studied extensively in Iran. Thus, this longitudinal study sought to investigate the prevalence, incidence and contributing factors of NSSI among adolescents in Iran. This study was conducted at high school students aged 14-18 years old in the metropolitan city of Tabriz, located in north western Iran. Data were collected from 6229 10th-grade students at two time-points, with 12 months interval in October and November 2017 and 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic, NSSI and cigarette and hookah smoking from the study participants. The results showed that lifetime prevalence of NSSI among students was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7 to 6.9) at the first assessment. Scratching and hair pulling were the most and least common methods of self-injury, respectively. Over the one year, 206 students (3.6% CI 95%: 3.1-4.1) reported the onset of NSSI. Tobacco smoking and previous year average grade were related to the incidence of NSSI. Although gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of NSSI, the relationship between gender and incidence of NSSI was not significant. Although the prevalence of NSSI was low among adolescents, the incidence rate was considerable.

Little information is known about nosocomial infections of HCWs in the initial period. We analysed data from HCWs with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital and their family members. METHODS We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines, and epidemiologic characteristics of 25 laboratory-confirmed and two highly suspected HCWs as well as ten of their family members with COVID-19 from Jan 5 to Feb 12, 2020. Among them, demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2\u00B13.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure with small, irrelevant mutations was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted person-to-person regardless of whether they have symptoms in both hospital settings and social activities based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close-contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.

This observational study aimed to identify demographic and morphologic factors associated with difficult FB intubation. METHODS We recruited 420 adult elective surgery patients undergoing tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Patients characteristics were recorded including age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, history of snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati score, upper lip bite test score, neck circumference and skinfold thickness, maximal neck flexion and extension angles, absence of teeth, Cormack and Lehane grade, presence of blood or secretions during intubation, as well as the inter-incisor, thyromental, sternothyroid, and manubriomental distances. The time (duration) needed to complete intubation (primary endpoint) and the number of attempts needed were correlated with these patient characteristics in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS Intubation was successful on the first attempt in 409/420 patients (97%). Seven patients (1.7%) needed more than one attempt. Failure to intubate with the FB occurred in four patients (1%). A correlation was found between intubation duration and visibility impaired by secretions or blood (P \u003C 0.001), higher neck skinfold thickness (P \u003C 0.001), and larger endotracheal tube diameter (relative to a constant 5.5 mm FB; P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of secretions or blood that impair FB glottic visualization, a larger diameter endotracheal tube on the same size FB, as well as higher neck skinfold thickness may prolong the duration of FB intubation under general anesthesia.

However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded. RESULTS The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells. The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days. The CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease. Accumulating of effector memory CD4\u002B T cells (CD4\u002BTEM) was observed among T-cell compartment. The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant\u0027s mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection. CONCLUSIONS The persistent reduction of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19. CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children. The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Liru; Jiao, Rong; Zhang, Aiming; Chen, Xi; Ning, Qin; Fang, Feng; Zeng, Fang; Tian, Niannian; Zhang, Yi; Huang, Yafei; Sun, Ziyan; Dhuromsingh, Menaka; Li, Hao; Li, Yang; Xu, Rongrong; Chen, Yu; Luo, Xiaoping","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","CD8","ill infant","treatment","persistent reduction of CD4","aggravating COVID","effector memory CD4","T-cell compartment","clinical characteristics","handful pediatric cases of COVID","ill pediatric patients","outbreak of coronavirus disease","critical cases","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding","prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding","acute kidney injury","life-threatening clinical features","persistent declined CD3","severity of respiratory injury","days post onset","critical course","recurrent apnea","high fever","petechiae","septic shock","serum antibody","laboratory data","typical feature","infant\u0027s mother","follow-up information","key role","nucleic acid tests","intimate contact","ability","METHODS Epidemiology","TEM","administration of lopinavir","ritonavir","adult","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","understanding","strict personal protection","transmission of SARS","children","global threat"],"language":"en"},

Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients\u0027 need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2.

These symptoms are also known as a behavioral risk marker in predicting pediatric mood disorders. The underlying neural mechanism of emotional dysregulation, however, remains unclear. This study used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to identify anatomically specific variation in white-matter microstructure that is associated with pediatric emotional dysregulation severity. Thirty-two children (mean age 9.53 years) with varying levels of emotional dysregulation symptoms were recruited by the Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent the DTI scans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Emotional dysregulation severity was measured by the empirically-derived Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Dysregulation Profile that includes the Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression tests revealed significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum-callosal regions linked to greater emotional dysregulation in the children. The results suggest that microstructural differences in cingulum-callosal white-matter pathways may manifest as a neurodevelopmental vulnerability for pediatric mood disorders as implicated in the clinical phenotype of pediatric emotional dysregulation. These findings may offer clinically and biologically relevant neural targets for early identification and prevention efforts for pediatric mood disorders.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Yuwen; Uchida, Mai; Gaillard, Schuyler L; Woodworth, Hilary; Kelberman, Caroline; Capella, James; Kadlec, Kelly; Goncalves, Mathias; Ghosh, Satrajit; Yendiki, Anastasia; Chai, Xiaoqian J; Hirshfeld-Becker, Dina R; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan; Gabrieli, John D E; Biederman, Joseph","journal":"NeuroImage.

Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are a biomarker of inflammatory disease activity in MS, but little is known about the relation of age and gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans in people with MS. In this study, we investigated the association of age and other risk factors with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI in a retrospective cross-sectional clinical MS cohort. METHODS In a cohort including 1543 people with CIS and MS, we investigated the association of the risk factors age, sex, disease course, immunomodulatory drug (IMD) treatment, and disability with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS Age was the most important factor associated with gadolinium enhancement, with the odds of gadolinium enhancement decreasing with advancing age. Participants with CIS had lower odds of gadolinium enhancement (odds ratio of 0.42, 95% confidence interval of 0.24-0.72 compared to RRMS). Sex, disease course and IMD treatment were not significantly associated with gadolinium enhancement in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Our investigation shows that gadolinium enhancement is strongly associated with age. Since gadolinium enhancement is a marker of inflammatory disease activity, our findings suggest that inflammatory disease activity declines with age, and that IMD treatment may be more beneficial in younger and less useful in older people with MS.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koch, Marcus W; Mostert, Jop; Greenfield, Jamie; Liu, Wei-Qiao; Metz, Luanne","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09895-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIS","IMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower odds of gadolinium enhancement","association of age","advancing age","RESULTS Age","relation of age","risk factors age","age-dependent process","disease course","inflammatory disease activity declines","biomarker of inflammatory disease activity","inflammatory demyelination","IMD treatment","cranial MRI scans","odds ratio","sex","formation of focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions","retrospective cross-sectional clinical MS cohort","CIS","older people","findings","radiological studies","immunomodulatory drug","disability","binary logistic regression model","important factor","BACKGROUND Epidemiological","confidence interval","Participants","CONCLUSIONS","investigation","study","METHODS","RRMS"],"language":"en"},

In this work, we apply time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) in aqueous solution to visualize the conformational dynamics of individual model protein molecules (E.coli RNA polymerase, RNAP) adsorbed on modified highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces. We quantitatively characterize the evolution of height and shape of individual RNAP molecules adsorbed on a HOPG surface modified with an oligoglycine-hydrocarbon graphite modifier (GM) during the unfolding process and determine the characteristic unfolding time as \u223C7 min. Furthermore, we make a HOPG surface antimetamorphic by modifying it with a denatured RNAP protein layer.

Thus, understanding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) needs among this diverse racial/ethnic group is critical. Using Ferrell\u0027s multidimensional framework for measuring QOL, we synthesized evidence on HRQOL needs among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors. METHODS We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, for English language articles published between 1995 and January 2020, reporting HRQOL among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors in the USA. RESULTS Of the 648 articles reviewed, 176 met inclusion criteria, with 100 of these studies focusing exclusively on breast cancer patients and no studies examining end-of-life HRQOL issues. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics/Latinos reported lower HRQOL and a higher symptom burden across multiple HRQOL domains. Over 80% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences in psychological well-being (n = 45) reported worse outcomes among Hispanics/Latinos compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors were also more likely to report suboptimal physical well-being in 60% of studies assessing racial/ethnic differences (n = 27), and Hispanics/Latinos also reported lower social well-being relative to non-Hispanics/Latinos in 78% of studies reporting these outcomes (n = 32). In contrast, reports of spiritual well-being and spirituality-based coping were higher among Hispanics/Latinos cancer survivors in 50% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences (n = 15). DISCUSSION Findings from this review point to the need for more systematic and tailored interventions to address HRQOL needs among this growing cancer survivor population.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing interventions to standard therapy, placebo or pre-post cohort comparisons for more than 4 weeks were included. The outcome included self-reported scales compared at baseline and a therapeutic time point. Risk of bias was evaluated by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. A total of 2812 articles were narrowed down to 309 for full-text screening. Four RCTs and one prospective cohort study, with a total of 634 JSLE patients, met the inclusion criteria. Four of the studies had a controlled intervention plus standard therapy compared with standard therapy alone or placebo. Multiple indices were used to evaluate HRQoL. These included the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, Simple Measure of Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters tool, Kids Fatigue Severity Scale and Child Depression Inventory. A single study reported a significant improvement while remaining studies reported no difference or failed to report the statistical analysis. Although HRQoL is significantly impaired in JSLE, evidence regarding its improvement is limited due to the small number of eligible studies, heterogeneity in scales, and HRQoL domains. A universal HRQoL questionnaire for JSLE needs to be established and used in both the research and clinical setting.

Understanding the neural bases of insight is crucial to help improve FTD diagnosis, classification and management. A systematic review to explore the neural correlates of altered insight in FTD and associated syndromes was conducted. Insight was fractionated to examine whether altered insight into different neuropsychological/behavioural objects is underpinned by different or compatible neural correlates. 6 databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, BIOSIS and ProQuest Dissertations \u0026 Theses Global) were interrogated between 1980 and August 2019. 15 relevant papers were found out of 660 titles screened. The studies included suggest that different objects of altered insight are associated with distinctive brain areas in FTD. For example, disease unawareness appears to predominantly correlate with right frontal involvement. In contrast, altered insight into social cognition potentially involves, in addition to frontal areas, the temporal gyrus, insula, parahippocampus and amygdala. Impaired insight into memory problems appears to be related to the frontal lobes, postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex and posterior cingulate. These results reflect to a certain extent those observed in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) and also other brain disorders. Nevertheless, they should be cautiously interpreted due to variability in the methodological aspects used to reach those conclusions. Future work should triangulate different insight assessment approaches and brain imaging techniques to increase the understanding of this highly relevant clinical phenomenon in dementia.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Neira, Carlos; Tedde, Andrea; Coulthard, Elizabeth; Thai, N Jade; Pennington, Catherine","journal":"NeuroImage.

While its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, the general extent of organ involvement as well as microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. METHODS This study reports autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in-corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. RESULTS The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolisms (n=4), alveolar haemorrhage (n=3) and vasculitis (n=1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open-source scans in supplementary files. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an overview of post-mortem findings in COVID-19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID-19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates amongst these patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menter, T; Haslbauer, J D; Nienhold, R; Savic, S; Hopfer, H; Deigendesch, N; Frank, S; Turek, D; Willi, N; Pargger, H; Bassetti, S; Leuppi, J D; Cathomas, G; Tolnay, M; Mertz, K D; Tzankov, A","journal":"Histopathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University Hospital Basel"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["COVID","patients","study reports autopsy findings","organ systems","cases","blood group","severe cardiovascular comorbidities","overview of post-mortem findings","associated organ alterations","respiratory failure","respiratory tract","male individuals","cardiovascular diseases","general extent of organ involvement","alveolar haemorrhage","Cantonal Hospital Baselland","University Hospital Basel","exudative diffuse alveolar damage","massive capillary congestion","obesity","open-source scans","higher mortality rates","elderly","shock","primary cause of death","signs of generalised thrombotic microangiopathy","supplementary files","pathophysiological explanation","microthrombi","diabetes mellitus","hypertensive","microscopic changes","overall predominance of males","hypertension","lower threshold of tolerance","senile cardiac amyloidosis","METHODS","relevant histological slides","optimal staff safety","major manifestation","Switzerland","pulmonary embolisms","corpore technique","lungs","anticoagulation","superimposed bronchopneumonia","CONCLUSIONS","Pathologies","Coronavirus disease","Autopsies","vasculitis","SARS-CoV","sweeping pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of a CXR severity scoring system for younger (non-elderly) patients with COVID-19 upon initial presentation to the emergency department (ED). Outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials \u0026 Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to EDs of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 - 26, 2020 with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were identified. Each patient\u0027s ED CXR was divided into 6 zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists with scores collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, CXR scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 males (62%), median age 39 [31-45]. After adjustment for demographics and co-morbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n=145, 43%) were CXR severity score \u2265 2 (OR: 6.2, 95% CI 3.5-11, p\u003C0.001) and obesity (OR 2.4 (1.1-5.4) or morbid obesity. Of patients who were admitted, a CXR score \u22653 was an independent predictor of intubation (n=28) (OR: 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-13, p=0.002) as was hospital site. We found no significant difference in primary outcomes across race/ethnicity, those with a history of tobacco use, asthma or diabetes mellitus type II.

For an optimal management of COVID-19 (Coronary Virus Disease) we depend on a fast and reliable diagnosis and severity assessment. The gold standard so far is RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polmerase chain reaction) from the nasopharyngeal smear. Current tests have a sensitivity of 60-90 %. As a consequence, we must expect 10-40 % false negative results. In addition to oxygen saturation for severity classification, stethoscope, chest X-ray and lung computer tomography are routinely used. However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable. Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure. In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices. In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osterwalder, Joseph","journal":"Praxis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1024/1661-8157/a003512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung point","Lung Pocus","Chest X-Ray","lung computer tomography","Lung CT Abstract","role of stethoscope","standard methods stethoscope","chest x ray","Sparing Use of Stethoscope","care ultrasound","severity classification","severity assessment","Lu-PoCUS","current value","gold standard","Current tests","Coronary Virus Disease","optimal management of COVID","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus","physicians","support staff","pulsoxymetry","reverse transcriptase polmerase chain reaction","subsequent patients","RT-PCR","oxygen saturation","diagnostic examination techniques","additional risk of exposure","reliable diagnosis","underutilized valuable alternative","contagiousness of SARS","nasopharyngeal smear","review","pocket devices","false negative results","available literature","sensitivity","consequence"],"language":"en"},

The optimal investigation of NVH is unclear, given the incidence of cancer and the public health implications of testing all individuals with this finding. OBJECTIVE We review contemporary literature to determine the association of NVH with the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and kidney cancer (KC). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review of original articles in English was completed in May 2019. Meta-analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of NVH and urine cytology were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We screened 1529 articles and selected 78 manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis. Forty manuscripts were eligible for a meta-analysis (reporting 19 193 persons). The likelihood of a urological cancer in patients with NVH increased with age (\u003C1% in those aged \u003C40yr), male sex, and cigarette smoking. Less than 1% of patients are found to have a urological cancer after a negative NVH evaluation. Cancer detection rates in individuals evaluated for NVH ranged from 0% to 16% for BC in 37 studies, 0% to 3.5% for UTUC in 30 studies, and 0% to 9.7% for KC in 29 studies. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present for the meta-analysis of detection rates. CONCLUSIONS We present an up-to-date review of the association of NVH with the diagnosis of BC, UTUC, and KC. Individuals with dipstick positive haematuria aged \u226540yr, who have had potential precipitating causes excluded, should undergo an evaluation. Re-evaluation of patients with unremarkable initial investigations should be performed in high-risk patients or if new symptoms occur. PATIENT SUMMARY One in five people have microscopic traces of blood in their urine. This is an important indicator of urological cancer. Investigating all patients is uncomfortable and expensive. We evaluate the risk of cancer and estimate risks to groups of individuals.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jubber, Ibrahim; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Conroy, Samantha; Tan, Wei Shen; Gordon, Patrick C; Lotan, Yair; Messing, Edward M; Stenzl, Arnulf; Rhijn, Bas van; Kelly, John D; Catto, James W F; Cumberbatch, Marcus G","journal":"European urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2019.10.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31791622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NVH","UTUC","KC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["association of NVH","incidence of cancer","kidney cancer","risk of cancer","undiagnosed urological cancer","Cancer detection rates","diagnosis of bladder cancer","important indicator of urological cancer","negative NVH evaluation","diagnostic accuracy of NVH","optimal investigation of NVH","UTUC","high-risk patients","Re-evaluation of patients","studies","diagnosis of BC","groups of individuals","meta-analysis of detection rates","Meta-analyses","yr","up-to-date review","manuscripts","EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS","KC","systematic review of original articles","urine cytology","common finding","narrative synthesis","dipstick positive haematuria","CONTEXT Non-visible haematuria","upper tract urothelial carcinoma","people","unremarkable initial investigations","public health implications","male sex","microscopic traces of blood","inclusion criteria","Substantial statistical heterogeneity","English","reporting","risks","contemporary literature","cigarette smoking","potential precipitating causes","new symptoms","persons","likelihood","PATIENT SUMMARY","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","age"],"language":"en"},

By mining whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data using machine learning approaches, we detected two lncRNAs (ENSG00000254680 and ENSG00000273149) that are downregulated in a wide range of viral infections and different cell types, including blood monocluclear cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and dermal fibroblasts. The efficiency of these two lncRNAs was positively validated in different viral phenotypic scenarios. These two lncRNAs showed a strong downregulation in virus-infected patients when compared to healthy control transcriptomes, indicating that these biomarkers are promising targets for infection diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study using host lncRNAs biomarkers for the diagnosis of human viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barral-Arca, Ruth; G\u00F3mez-Carballa, Alberto; Cebey-L\u00F3pez, Miriam; Curr\u00E1s-Tuala, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; Pischedda, Sara; Viz-Lasheras, Sandra; Bello, Xabier; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21082748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host lncRNAs biomarkers","wide range of viral infections","viral host invasion","diagnosis of human viral infections","different viral phenotypic scenarios","infection diagnosis","wide range of mechanisms","unraveling gene expression mechanisms","infection progression","blood monocluclear cells","different cell types","umbilical vein endothelial cells","RNA-seq","data","virus-infected patients","transcriptome shotgun sequencing","machine learning approaches","strong downregulation","non-coding RNAs","dermal fibroblasts","healthy control transcriptomes","immune system","promising targets","Current findings","mining","study","ENSG00000254680","ENSG00000273149","best","knowledge","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

There is scarce literature about these diseases in dairy regions in Colombia. In 29 randomly selected herds in Pasto, Colombia, 249 dairy cows were followed weekly for two months postpartum to determine: 1) incidence risk of SARA and SCK; and 2) effects of SARA and SCK on the occurrence of postpartum anestrus (PA) at two months. Samples from ruminal liquor and blood were obtained one time per cow during the first week postpartum to determine presence of SARA (pH \u003C 5.6) and SCK (1.0-2.9 mmol/L of blood Beta-Hydroxy-Butyrate), respectively. PA diagnosis was determined with ultrasound. Pregnancy risks at 30 and 60 days post-breeding (and assumed embryo losses between these days) were determined. Risk factors associated with PA were estimated through a mixed multi-level multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for clustering of cows within herds. The incidence risks of SARA and SCK were 23.3% and 46.2%, respectively. Simultaneous occurrence of SCK and SARA (SCASCK) was present in 5.2% of the cows. In the final multivariable model, the occurrence of SARA (Odds Ratio: OR = 39.4), SCK (OR = 47.4) and SCASCK (OR = 68.5) was associated with increased odds of PA. Feeding a transition period diet was associated with reduced odds of PA (OR = 0.15). Second parity cows had significantly lower odds of PA than first parity cows (OR = 0.21). In conclusion, inadequate pre-partum and postpartum nutritional management of the herds increased the occurrence of SARA and SCK, which had adverse effects on reproductive performance.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vallejo-Timar\u00E1n, Dar\u00EDo; Reyes-V\u00E9lez, Juli\u00E1n; VanLeeuwen, John; Maldonado-Estrada, Juan; Astaiza-Mart\u00EDnez, Juan","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Subclinical Ketosis"],"organizations":["SARA","PA"],"locations":["Colombia"],"keyphrases":["occurrence of SARA","effects of SARA","presence of SARA","Simultaneous occurrence of SCK","incidence risks of SARA","parity cows","incidence risk of SARA","clustering of cows","reduced odds of PA","lower odds of PA","occurrence of postpartum anestrus","months postpartum","PA diagnosis","increased odds of","prevalent metabolic diseases of dairy cows","week postpartum","Odds Ratio","postpartum nutritional management","dairy regions","Colombia","selected herds","reproductive performance","SCASCK","final multivariable model","Subclinical Ruminal Acidosis","Subclinical Ketosis","adverse effects","ruminal liquor","Pregnancy risks","Risk factors","days post-breeding","blood Beta-Hydroxy","mixed multi-level multivariable logistic regression model","inadequate pre-partum","assumed embryo losses","Pasto","impacts","transition period diet","time","conclusion","scarce literature","Butyrate","Samples","mmol","pH","ultrasound"],"language":"en"},

There has not yet been a systematic, critical appraisal of the relative strength of evidence among subsets of the practice of facial plastic surgery. METHODS The current study is a systematic review, designed to evaluate the level of evidence observed in the facial plastic surgery literature. Five journals were queried using facial plastic surgery terms for four selected years over a 10-year period. Following screening, articles were assigned to a category regarding subject matter, assessed for the presence of various methodological traits, and evaluated for overall level of evidence. Comparisons were made in regard to level of evidence across the breadth of facial plastic surgery subject matter. RESULTS A total of 826 articles were included for final review. Studies on operative facial rejuvenation and rhinoplasty had significantly fewer authors on average than studies on cancer reconstruction or craniofacial topics. Craniofacial studies demonstrated higher levels of evidence relative to all other categories, with the exception of facial paralysis and facial trauma studies, from which there was no significant difference. In general, reconstructive studies had significantly more authors and higher levels of evidence than did articles with an aesthetic focus. CONCLUSION Level of evidence in facial plastic surgery remains relatively weak overall.

The latest developments in machine learning (including deep learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for electronic health records (EHR), capable of simultaneously predicting the likelihood of 301 conditions in one\u0027s future visits.

In addition to its scalability and superior accuracy, BEHRT enables personalised interpretation of its predictions; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to further improve the accuracy of its predictions; its (pre-)training results in disease and patient representations can be useful for future studies (i.e., transfer learning).","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yikuan; Rao, Shishir; Solares, Jos\u00E9 Roberto Ayala; Hassaine, Abdelaali; Ramakrishnan, Rema; Canoy, Dexter; Zhu, Yajie; Rahimi, Kazem; Salimi-Khorshidi, Gholamreza","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62922-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deep learning","BEHRT","precision healthcare","machine learning","patients","predictions","transfer learning","existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models","future studies","superior accuracy","Early indication","future visits","latest developments","decades of developments","deep neural sequence transduction model","better disease management","chance of early intervention","terms of average precision scores","efficient allocation of healthcare resources","electronic health records","patient representations","different tasks","training results","personalised interpretation","vast majority of diagnoses","diagnosis","great opportunity","multiple heterogeneous concepts","flexible architecture","individuals","medicine","carers","scalability","detection of diseases","medication","unmet need","conditions","likelihood","addition","striking improvement","noticeable signs of illness","measurements","data","study"],"language":"en"},

However, there are few prospective studies evaluating the use of a direct aspiration first pass technique in distal vessel occlusions. This post hoc analysis of the PROMISE study examines the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the ACE68 and ACE64 Reperfusion Catheters for aspiration thrombectomy in the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery. METHODS PROMISE is a prospective, multicenter study that enrolled 204 patients with anterior circulation LVO AIS-treated frontline with ACE68/ACE64 catheters. We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes, complications, and mortality in patients with M1 and M2 occlusions. The association of M1 and M2 location and functional independence or mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion was described in univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS One hundred sixty-one patients (124 M1 and 37 M2 locations) met the study criteria. Post procedure mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion (93% vs. 92%, p = 1.00), functional independence (57% vs. 70%, p = 0.18), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.55), device- or procedure-related serious adverse events at 30 days (4.0% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.39), and mortality at 90 days (6.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.69) were comparable between M1 and M2 occlusions. In multivariable analysis, lower age, lower baseline NIHSS, and shorter time from onset to admission were independent predictors of functional independence. CONCLUSIONS For frontline aspiration thrombectomy of stroke, use of large-bore ACE68/ACE64 catheters for treatment of M2 occlusions appeared as safe and effective as for M1 occlusions.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navia, Pedro; Schramm, Peter; Fiehler, Jens","journal":"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919894800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Penumbra System","LVO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M1 occlusions","treatment of M2 occlusions","M2 segments","M2 locations","association of M1","ACE64 catheters","ACE68","ACE64 Reperfusion Catheters","patients","distal vessel occlusions","frontline aspiration thrombectomy of stroke","PROMISE study","therapy of proximal large vessel occlusions","direct aspiration","independent predictors of functional independence","multicenter study","mortality","study criteria","Post procedure mTICI","multivariable analysis","days","use","benefit of endovascular thrombectomy","lower age","anterior circulation LVO AIS-treated frontline","METHODS PROMISE","prospective studies","multivariable analyses","lower baseline NIHSS","acute ischemic stroke","procedure-related serious adverse events","admission","shorter time","pass technique","onset","Penumbra System","complications","safety","effectiveness","middle cerebral artery","angiographic outcomes","PURPOSE","device","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To date, no definitive treatment or vaccine application exists for COVID-19. Although new investigations seek to repurpose existing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered to have antiviral capabilities may be critical as well to address this global concern. One such avenue that may prove to be exceeding fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent work has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability tied to COVID-19. Furthermore, pathways that can activate mTOR may be necessary for antihepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication, and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination. Yet, important considerations for the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist. Under some conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication and virion release from cells. Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warranted and with greater understanding of this novel pathway, new Maiese, CNR 17,3, mTOR and Antivirals, treatments against several viral infections may successfully emerge including therapy directed for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maiese, Kenneth","journal":"Current neurovascular research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666200425205122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Public Health","AMPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mTOR pathways","COVID","associated pathways of mTOR Complex","new antiviral therapy","effective antiviral therapy","potential antiviral target","antiviral capabilities","existing antiviral treatments","virion replication","new Maiese","coronavirus family virion","virion release","new investigations","coronavirus disease","AMPK","global disease","SARS-CoV","global concern","reduction of influenza","virus replication","exciting potential","influenza vaccination","definitive treatment","Future work","Recent work","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","mechanistic target of rapamycin","World Health Organization","innovative treatment strategies","development of safe","novel pathway","type","antihepatitis C activity","CNR","valuable targets","oxidative stress","cell injury","interferon responses","greater understanding","Antivirals","conjunction","mTORC1","onset of hyperinflammation","vaccine application","double edge sword","significant disability","viral infections","mTORC2","cells","protein kinase","important considerations","date","developing etiology","pandemic","conditions","avenue"],"language":"en"},

METHOD Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. RESULTS A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.

METHODS A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Krom, G; Severijns, Y; Vlieg, W L; Arens, Y H J M; Van Golde, R J T; De Die-Smulders, C E M; Van Osch, L A D M","journal":"Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01810-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cons of PGT","PGT centre","PGT programme","considerations of couples","long trajectory of PGT","structural chromosomal abnormality","successful pregnancy","spontaneous conception","termination of pregnancy","ongoing pregnancy","natural conception","PND","qualitative exploratory study","relevant reproductive options","infertility","semi-structured dyadic interviews","recurrent miscarriage","preimplantation genetic testing","attempts","birth","adverse experiences","advanced maternal age","perceived pros","prenatal diagnosis","psychological support","counselling","fastest way","informative consultation","important motive","decision-making process","main reason","opinion","Information","METHODS","affected child","chance","motives","wish","majority","Netherlands","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

Findings from a cross-sectional study.","doi":"10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104463","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32408243","license":"unk","abstract":"INTRODUCTION It is expected that future nurses have high levels of emotional intelligence and empathy, because of their everyday interaction with people in a clinical environment. Thus, nursing students must show interest in nursing studies and in work with people. Moreover, it is desired that they have good communication skills. On the other hand, students who choose nursing as their future career may have high expectations from nursing education. The aim of this study was to explore nursing students\u0027 reasons for pursuing nursing studies. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate nursing students in Slovenia and Croatia. RESULTS A total of 314 students participated in the study. General satisfaction with their studies is higher among those students who are satisfied with their chosen study programme. The most important reasons to enter nursing studies were interest in the subject and good employment possibilities. As the biggest disadvantage of studying nursing, Slovenian students listed crowded schedules, while Croatian students mentioned faculty organization. Students from both countries agreed that the biggest advantage is the ease of finding a job after graduation. DISCUSSION As there is a lack of workforce in the healthcare sector, particularly a lack of nurses, universities must adjust their demands and improve study conditions to gain students\u0027 attention. Therefore, it is important to notice that nursing students perceive more advantages of studying nursing than disadvantages. CONCLUSION There are many different reasons to enter nursing studies. Students perceive many advantages in studying nursing, such as ease of employment, getting many hours of clinical practice and the possibility for promotion. On the other hand, there are some challenges in studying nursing, such as the schedule and organization of lectures, seminars and clinical placement. There is a need for further research in the field of nursing student\u0027s motivation, especially due to their decreasing motivation during the studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cilar, Leona; Spevan, Marija; \u010Cu\u010Dek Trifkovi\u010D, Klavdija; \u0160tiglic, Gregor","journal":"Nurse education today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Slovenia","Croatia"],"keyphrases":["undergraduate nursing students","nursing education","pursuing nursing studies","nursing students\u0027 reasons","Croatian students","Slovenian students","field of nursing student\u0027s motivation","study conditions","cross-sectional study","important reasons","chosen study programme","future nurses","lack of nurses","clinical placement","clinical environment","different reasons","ease of employment","people","hand","hours of clinical practice","good employment possibilities","high expectations","future career","organization of lectures","students\u0027 attention","lack of workforce","faculty organization","biggest disadvantage","biggest advantage","decreasing motivation","good communication skills","high levels of emotional intelligence","crowded schedules","empathy","seminars","everyday interaction","healthcare sector","possibility","research","demands","promotion","universities","General satisfaction","countries","need","job","graduation","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","challenges","disadvantages","DISCUSSION","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

This multi-agent MRI technology would enable a whole new class of basic science and clinical MRI experiments that simultaneously explore multiple physiologic/molecular events in vivo. Unfortunately, conventional MRI acquisition techniques are only capable of detecting and quantifying one paramagnetic MRI contrast agent at a time. Herein, the Dual Contrast - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (DC-MRF) methodology was extended for in vivo application and evaluated by simultaneously and dynamically mapping the intra-tumoral concentration of two MRI contrast agents (Gd-BOPTA and Dy-DOTA-azide) in a mouse glioma model. Co-registered gadolinium and dysprosium concentration maps were generated with sub-millimeter spatial resolution and acquired dynamically with just over 2-minute temporal resolution. Mean tumor Gd and Dy concentration measurements from both single agent and dual agent DC-MRF studies demonstrated significant correlations with ex vivo mass spectrometry elemental analyses. This initial in vivo study demonstrates the potential for DC-MRF to provide a useful dual-agent MRI platform.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Christian E; Johansen, Mette; Erokwu, Bernadette O; Hu, He; Gu, Yuning; Zhang, Yifan; Kavran, Michael; Vincent, Jason; Drumm, Mitchell L; Griswold, Mark A; Steinmetz, Nicole F; Li, Ming; Clark, Heather; Darrah, Rebecca J; Yu, Xin; Brady-Kalnay, Susann M; Flask, Chris A","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56531-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31882792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["paramagnetic MRI contrast agent","multi-agent MRI technology","single agent","useful dual-agent MRI platform","clinical MRI experiments","dual agent DC-MRF studies","Synchronous assessment of multiple MRI contrast agents","conventional MRI acquisition techniques","fluorescence imaging","Dy concentration measurements","Dual Contrast - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting","dysprosium concentration maps","imaging capability similar","unlimited imaging depth","intra-tumoral concentration","high spatiotemporal resolution","minute temporal resolution","Gd-BOPTA","Dy-DOTA","multi-color","sub-millimeter spatial resolution","single scanning session","Mean tumor Gd","new class of basic science","significant correlations","azide","mass spectrometry elemental analyses","Co-registered gadolinium","potential","methodology","time","mouse glioma model","molecular events","study","application"],"language":"en"},

There are best practices for early isolation and containment of suspect cases while protecting health care workers and limiting cross infections that are transferable across nations.

The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with \u03B1\u003C 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS All six of the questions - 1) \u0022I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;\u0022 2) \u0022I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;\u0022 3) \u0022I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;\u0022 4)\u0022I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;\u0022 5) \u0022I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;\u0022 and 6) \u0022I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles\u0022 - showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - \u0022I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;\u0022 and \u0022This training was valuable\u0022 - received high scores on the Likert scale. CONCLUSION This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Owens, Michael D; Lloyd, Michael L; Brady, Tyler M; Gross, Robin","journal":"The western journal of emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.4.47385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["United States","Angola"],"keyphrases":["mobile RRT laboratory","contagious laboratory sample","mobile laboratory concepts","real laboratory sample test","Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum","mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS","post training","contagious sample","negative sample","day training workshop","Likert scale questions","purpose","nation of Angola","confirmed coronavirus","confirmed cases","post survey","statistical significant change pre","rapid diagnostic resource","suspected contagious outbreak","paired t-test","confirmed disease prevalence","real scenario","lack of COVID","confidence interval","rapid response team","participant self-assessment","pandemic resource allocation","process improvement assessment","low middle income countries","principles","epidemic","Ebola","PCR","lab environment","LMIC","CONCLUSION","United States","high scores","basic Biobubble","infectious contagion","ability","polymerase chain reaction","testing capacity","effectiveness","national level","deaths","Luanda","procedures","safe working","growing threat","study","World Health Organization","scene diagnostics","regions","role","position","individuals","course","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we compared different skin closure techniques during emergency cesarean section to identify the best technique with minimal wound complication rates. Methods Patients were randomized into 3 groups (group A, n=100; group B, n=102; and group C, n=98). In group A, the skin was closed using staples; in group B, via the subcuticular technique using monocryl 3-0; and in group C, using mattress suture nylon (2-0). The primary outcome was a composite of wound complications, including infection, seroma, gaping, and need for resuturing and antibiotic administration. The secondary outcome included closure time, pain perception, patient satisfaction, and cost. Analyses were performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Results The composite wound complication rate in the entire cohort was 16.6% (n=50); the complication rate was significantly higher in group A than in the other groups.

METHODS Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2020 were reviewed, including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for specialty drugs, biosimilars, and diabetes medications. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2020 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS In 2019, overall US pharmaceutical expenditures grew 5.4% compared to 2018, for a total of $507.9 billion. This increase was driven to similar degrees by prices, utilization, and new drugs. Adalimumab was the top drug in US expenditures in 2019, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $36.9 billion (a 1.5% increase from 2018) and $90.3 billion (an 11.8% increase from 2018) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals growth was driven by new products and price increases. Several new drugs that will likely influence spending are expected to be approved in 2020. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures. CONCLUSION For 2020 we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 9.0% to 11.0% and 2.0% to 4.0%, respectively, compared to 2019. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tichy, Eric M; Schumock, Glen T; Hoffman, James M; Suda, Katie J; Rim, Matthew H; Tadrous, Mina; Stubbings, JoAnn; Cuellar, Sandra; Clark, John S; Wiest, Michelle D; Matusiak, Linda M; Hunkler, Robert J; Vermeulen, Lee C","journal":"American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Adalimumab"],"organizations":["IQVIA National Sales Perspectives"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Drug expenditures","new drugs","hospitals growth","growth of pharmaceutical expenditures","clinics","new drug approvals","overall prescription drug spending","new products","drug purchases","future spending","nonfederal hospitals","US expenditures","overall US pharmaceutical expenditures","historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures","actual spending","specialty drugs","potential new policies","national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth","cancer drugs","myriad of local factors","METHODS Historical patterns","increased utilization","Focused analyses","clinic sectors","price increases","combination of quantitative analyses","IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database","manufacturers","patent expirations","particular health system","prices","expert opinion","similar degrees","biosimilars","diabetes medications","United States","apixaban","legislation","PURPOSE","RESULTS","insulin glargine","CONCLUSION","Adalimumab","total"],"language":"en"},

This paper compares the performances of a diathermic knife and a CO2 laser handpiece, both clinically approved, coupled to a rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) source for quasi-instantaneous tissue classification. Several fresh meat samples (muscle, liver, bone, bone marrow, cartilage, skin, fat) were obtained from different animals. Overall, the laser produced cleaner cuts and more reproducible and higher spectral quality signals when compared with the diathermic knife (CV laser = 9-12%, CV diathermic = 14-23%). The molecular profiles were subsequently entered into a database and PCA/LDA classification/prediction models were built to assess if the data generated with one sampling modality can be employed to classify the data generated with the other handpiece. We demonstrate that the correct classification rate of the models increases (\u002B 25%) with the introduction of a model based on peak lists that are tissue-specific and common to the two handpieces, compared with considering solely the whole molecular profile. This renders it possible to use a unique and universal database for quasi-instantaneous tissue recognition which would provide similar classification results independent of the handpiece used. Furthermore, the laser was able to generate aerosols rich in lipids from hard tissues such as bone, bone marrow, and cartilage. Combined, these results demonstrate that REIMS is a valuable and versatile tool for instantaneous identification/classification of hard tissue and coupling to different aerosol-generating handpieces expands its field of application.

The viral spike protein binds the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and thus is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share this mechanism. Here we functionally analyzed the key amino acid residues located within receptor binding motif of RBD that may interact with human ACE2 and available neutralizing antibodies. The in vivo experiments showed that immunization with either the SARS-CoV RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD was able to induce strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice; however, the cross-neutralizing activity was much weaker, indicating that there are distinct antigenic features in the RBDs of the two viruses. This finding was confirmed with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 human antibody, HA001, was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but failed to recognize SARS-CoV. Moreover, the potential epitope residues of HA001 were identified as A475 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, representing new binding sites for neutralizing antibodies. Overall, our study has revealed the presence of different key epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicates the necessity to develop new prophylactic vaccine and antibody drugs for specific control of the COVID-19 pandemic although the available agents obtained from the SARS-CoV study are unneglectable.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Chunyan; Sun, Xiaoyu; Ye, Jing; Ding, Longfei; Liu, Meiqin; Yang, Zhuo; Lu, Xiao; Zhang, Yaguang; Ma, Liyang; Gu, Wangpeng; Qu, Aidong; Xu, Jianqing; Shi, Zhengli; Ling, Zhiyang; Sun, Bing","journal":"Cellular \u0026 molecular immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-020-0458-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV RBD","SARS-CoV study","developed SARS-CoV","novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV","available neutralizing antibodies","available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies","receptor binding motif of RBD","strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies","human antibody","human ACE2","receptor-binding domain","new binding sites","available agents","COVID","host receptor angiotensin","specific control","antibody drugs","key amino acid residues","potential epitope residues of HA001","viral entry","major threat","major target","Coronavirus disease","new prophylactic vaccine","viral spike protein","presence of different key epitopes","mice","RBDs","pandemic","enzyme","A475","F486","distinct antigenic features","cross","public health","necessity","immunization","activity","finding","mechanism","viruses","experiments"],"language":"en"},

For most patients, these reflect non-specialist rather than specialist palliative care needs. Embedding palliative care principles early in patients\u0027 disease trajectories within acute care delivery in hospitals, however, is a challenge. How to best understand the experiences of those providing non-specialist palliative care in hospitals has not been systematically assessed. AIM To synthesise the evidence on healthcare providers\u0027 views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. DESIGN A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis using Thomas and Harden\u0027s thematic synthesis framework. DATA SOURCES Databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched from date of inception to March 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on healthcare providers\u0027 views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. Studies were appraised for quality but not excluded on that basis. The review was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS Thirty-nine papers of 37 studies were included, representing 985 hospital healthcare providers\u0027 views and experiences. Four major analytical themes emerged; \u0027Understanding of Palliative Care\u0027, \u0027Complexities of Communication\u0027, \u0027Hospital Ecosystem\u0027 and \u0027Doctors and Nurses - a Different Lens\u0027. CONCLUSIONS Non-specialist palliative care in hospitals is operationalised as care in the last weeks and days of life. The organisation of acute care, inter-disciplinary working practices, clinician attitudes, poor communication structures and lack of education and training in palliative care principles exacerbates poor implementation of this care earlier for patients in hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nevin, Mary; Hynes, Geralyn; Smith, Valerie","journal":"Palliative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216319899335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Thomas","Harden"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["palliative care principles","specialist palliative care needs","experiences of non-specialist palliative care","hospitals","CONCLUSIONS Non-specialist palliative care","acute care delivery","organisation of acute care","hospital healthcare providers\u0027 views","Studies","BACKGROUND Healthcare providers","poor communication structures","qualitative systematic review","poor implementation","Harden\u0027s thematic synthesis framework","Complexities of Communication","Hospital Ecosystem","inter-disciplinary working practices","International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews","clinician attitudes","Thomas","patients\u0027 disease trajectories","lack of education","training","CINAHL","EMBASE","PsycINFO","Doctors","DATA SOURCES Databases of MEDLINE","Nurses","inclusion","evidence","Different Lens","weeks","date of inception","days of life","major analytical themes","quality","RESULTS","papers","basis","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Screening titles and abstracts (T\u0026Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T\u0026Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research. METHODS We identified software tools using three search methods: a web-based search; a search of the online \u0022systematic review toolbox\u0022; and screening of references in existing literature. We included tools that were accessible and available for testing at the time of the study (December 2018), do not require specific computing infrastructure and provide basic screening functionality for systematic reviews. Key properties of each software tool were identified using a feature analysis adapted for this purpose. This analysis included a weighting developed by a group of medical researchers, therefore prioritising the most relevant features. The highest scoring tools from the feature analysis were then included in a user survey, in which we further investigated the suitability of the tools for supporting T\u0026Ab screening amongst systematic reviewers working in medical research. RESULTS Fifteen tools met our inclusion criteria. They vary significantly in relation to cost, scope and intended user community. Six of the identified tools (Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, DRAGON, EPPI-Reviewer and Rayyan) scored higher than 75% in the feature analysis and were included in the user survey. Of these, Covidence and Rayyan were the most popular with the survey respondents. Their usability scored highly across a range of metrics, with all surveyed researchers (n = 6) stating that they would be likely (or very likely) to use these tools in the future. CONCLUSIONS Based on this study, we would recommend Covidence and Rayyan to systematic reviewers looking for suitable and easy to use tools to support T\u0026Ab screening within healthcare research. These two tools consistently demonstrated good alignment with user requirements. We acknowledge, however, the role of some of the other tools we considered in providing more specialist features that may be of great importance to many researchers.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Hannah; Griffin, Simon J; Kuhn, Isla; Usher-Smith, Juliet A","journal":"BMC medical research methodology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-0897-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rayyan"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified tools","usability of software tools","use of appropriate tools","Ab screening","highest scoring tools","systematic reviewers","BACKGROUND Systematic reviews","screening of references","Screening titles","feature analysis","user survey","systematic review toolbox","Covidence","healthcare research","Rayyan","study","basic screening functionality","search methods","user requirements","web-based search","based medicine","surveyed researchers","intended user community","group of medical researchers","survey respondents","inclusion criteria","specialist features","relevant features","DRAGON","Colandr","pursuit of evidence","EPPI-Reviewer","Abstrackr","specific computing infrastructure","testing","scope","good alignment","abstracts","great importance","range of metrics","time","Key properties","existing literature","weighting","RESULTS","step","relation","purpose","suitability","CONCLUSIONS","future","role"],"language":"en"},

Individuals and families experiencing homelessness are vulnerable in terms of health and underutilise health services. Despite being a global problem, not much is known about the range and breath of literature exploring health problems and health care service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa. OBJECTIVES To identify the nature and scope of existing evidence on physical and mental health, and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa. The review aimed to examine how research is conducted, identify gaps, guide future research, and make recommendations for development and implementation of policies and practices. METHODS A search of articles and reports involving six databases: Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, African Journal Online, and Google Scholar was conducted from June 2018 to February 2019. Studies published between 1980 and 2019 that examined the health problems and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa were considered. Manual search in reference lists and grey literature was also done to add reports. Data was extracted manually using a charting developed. A descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were performed. RESULTS Of 761 records found, 14 satisfied the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three themes emerged from the studies: Physical health problems, mental health problems; and healthcare services utilisation. Of the 14 included studies, nine studied and reported physical health problems such as sexually transmitted infections, injuries and disabilities, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Five studies explored mental health problems such as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Only five studies investigated utilisation of different types of health care services among homeless people. CONCLUSIONS Evidence shows that homeless adults suffered from a range of physical and mental health problems, and underutilisation of health care services. However, there is lack of information on the complex interrelationship between homelessness and health, as well as differences in prevalence of health problems among the various sub-groups of homeless. There is also lack of information regarding utilisation other important healthcare services such as mental health services, alcohol and drugs services, and accident and emergency service, and future researches should address that. Also, attention should be given to intervention models for complex and effective physical and psychiatric care as well as social support to address the homeless people\u0027s health vulnerabilities.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osei Asibey, Benedict; Conroy, Elizabeth; Marjadi, Brahmaputra","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08648-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["mental health problems","Physical health problems","mental health services","terms of health","health service utilisation","prevalence of health problems","health care service utilisation","underutilisation of health care services","homeless people\u0027s health vulnerabilities","utilisation of different types of health care services","homeless adults","healthcare services utilisation","drugs services","range of physical","important healthcare services","included studies","emergency service","psychiatric care","various sub-groups of homeless","BACKGROUND Homelessness","information","reports","mood disorders","psychotic disorders","grey literature","breath of literature","complex interrelationship","Manual search","search of articles","CONCLUSIONS Evidence","future researches","scope of existing evidence","large number of people","self-harm","CINAHL","disabilities","accident","transmitted infections","alcohol","African Journal","social support","PubMed","MEDLINE","injuries","development","databases","Scopus","recommendations","reference lists","intervention models","suicidal behaviour","growing concern","pre-determined inclusion","exclusion criteria","implementation of policies","nature","families","differences","cardiac diseases","descriptive analysis","narrative synthesis","practices","Google Scholar","Individuals","METHODS","gaps","records","OBJECTIVES","attention","themes","global problem","charting","RESULTS","review"],"language":"en"},

Anatomical variations of the intranasal branching may result in long operative time and possible inadequate cauterization. A modification of ESPAL by cauterization at the sphenopalatine foramen (SPF), has been performed by our group. Our study assessed the clinical benefit of endoscopic sphenopalatine foramen cauterization (ESFC) and compared it to ESPAL. METHOD A retrospective study was conducted. Patients who received ESFC for posterior epistaxis from 2016 to 2018 at a tertiary hospital were recruited. Middle meatal antrostomy was done. After ethmoidal crest was identified and nipped, pterygopalatine fossa was entered through the SPF. Sphenopalatine artery (SPA) and its branches within the SPF were cauterized without identification of any SPA distal branches in the nasal cavity. Patients receiving conventional ESPAL by the same surgeon were recruited and compared as control. Patients were followed-up for 3 months. Success rate, operative time, and complication were assessed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were identified. Recurrent epistaxis was absent in 90.0% and 100% of patients receiving ESPAL (9/10 patients) and ESFC (24/24 patients) respectively, p = 0.294. Median operative time was 115 and 60 min, respectively, p \u003C 0.001. Ipsilateral hard palatal or anterior palatal numbness were found in one and three patients, respectively. All resolved spontaneously within 2 weeks. CONCLUSION ESFC is effective in treating posterior epistaxis. It requires significantly less amount of time while the success rate was comparable to conventional ESPAL.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chitsuthipakorn, Wirach; Seresirikachorn, Kachorn; Kanjanawasee, Dichapong; Snidvongs, Kornkiat","journal":"European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06005-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PURPOSE Endoscopic","ESFC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Patients","conventional ESPAL","modification of ESPAL","posterior epistaxis","SPF","Median operative time","CONCLUSION ESFC","Recurrent epistaxis","clinical benefit of endoscopic sphenopalatine foramen cauterization","PURPOSE Endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation","Success rate","possible inadequate cauterization","SPA distal branches","effective treatment","retrospective study","anterior palatal numbness","intranasal branching","nasal cavity","identification","Anatomical variations","surgeon","complication","pterygopalatine fossa","Middle meatal antrostomy","METHOD","ethmoidal crest","tertiary hospital","control","RESULTS","group","months","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The optimal dosing of HCQ is unknown. Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment. The data sources included were 1) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic, and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n=116), 2) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, 3) a population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ and 4) a model relating chloroquine pharmacokinetics to QTc prolongation. A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation. SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ pharmacokinetics (p\u003C0.001). The extrapolated patient EC50 was 4.7 \u00B5M, comparable to the reported in vitro EC50 \u0027s. HCQ doses \u003E 400 mg BID for \u22655 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared to lower dose (\u2264400 mg daily) regimens. However, HCQ doses \u003E600 mg BID were also predicted to prolong QTc intervals. This prolongation may have clinical implications warranting further safety assessment. Due to COVID-19\u0027s variable natural history, lower dose HCQ regimens may be indistinguishable from controls. Evaluation of higher HCQ doses is needed to ensure adequate safety and efficacy.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Cremades, Maria; Solans, Belen P; Hughes, Emma; Ernest, Jacqueline P; Wallender, Erika; Aweeka, Francesca; Luetkemeyer, Annie; Savic, Radojka M","journal":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ pharmacokinetics","optimal dosing of HCQ","lower dose HCQ regimens","population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ","Evaluation of higher HCQ doses","efficacious HCQ dosing strategies","detectable SARS-CoV","QTc model","QTc prolongation","viral replication data","virologic data","viral loads","COVID","rate of viral decline","toxicity data","data sources","QTc intervals","viral load inhibition","infection","treatment courses","BID","proportion of patients","clinical implications","chloroquine pharmacokinetics","adequate safety","safety assessment","extrapolated patient EC50","s variable natural history","severe acute respiratory syndrome","\u00B5M","promising candidate","Coronavirus Disease","mechanistic PK","controls","goal","efficacy","azithromycin","Hydroxychloroquine","days"],"language":"en"},

In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE Due to an urgent need for a tool which would make it possible to present important reports, and which would be based on valid data sources only, a team of government experts together with researchers focused on the design and development of a web application intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general public. METHODS The CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) standardized methodology for knowledge mining from database structures was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data, which provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system, the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders, as well as data collection, processing, analysis, validation and visualization. RESULTS The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal\u0027s primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths together with the daily and cumulative overviews of COVID-19-positive persons, performed tests, location and country of infection of COVID-19-positive persons, hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the coronavirus disease epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way how to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts, who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis, with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web applications and leadership in the health care sector.

However, LA is technically demanding and whether the results are comparable with those of open ablation (OA) has not been determined to date. This study compared the effectiveness of LA and OA in achieving local tumor control of CRLMs. METHODS Patients undergoing LA or OA of CRLMs at Ghent University Hospital between June 2007 and February 2018 were identified from a prospective database. Lesions treated by LA and OA were matched 1:1 using a propensity score based on lesions (liver segment, size, deepness, proximity to a vessel), patients, and procedural characteristics. Ablation sites were followed up with computed-tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess the completeness of the ablation and ablation-site recurrence (ASR). Analysis of ASR was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. RESULTS In this study, 163 patients underwent the surgical ablation (78 LA, 85 OA) of 333 CRLMs (143 LA, 190 OA). After matching, 220 lesions (110 LA, 110 OA) were analyzed. Ablation was complete in 93.7% (LA) and 97.3% (OA) of the sites (p = 0.195). No difference in ASR was observed (p = 0.351), with a cumulative risk of ASR at 12 months of 9.1% (LA) and 8.2% (OA). After multivariable analysis, ASR was confirmed to be independent of the surgical approach. CONCLUSION The findings showed that LA and OA achieve a comparable local control of CRLMs. This result further supports the adoption of a laparoscopic approach for the treatment of CRLMs.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giglio, Mariano Cesare; Logghe, Bram; Garofalo, Eleonora; Tomassini, Federico; Vanlander, Aude; Berardi, Giammauro; Montalti, Roberto; Troisi, Roberto Ivan","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08243-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32060758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LA","OA","Ghent University Hospital","ASR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OA of CRLMs","effectiveness of LA","surgical ablation","Ablation sites","open ablation","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ablation","treatment of CRLMs","Analysis of ASR","comparable local control of CRLMs","ablation-site recurrence","Lesions","local tumor control of CRLMs","laparoscopic approach","laparoscopic liver resection","cumulative risk of ASR","liver segment","METHODS Patients","surgical approach","study","results","colorectal liver metastases","multivariable analysis","magnetic resonance imaging","proximity","deepness","computed-tomography","size","completeness","Kaplan-Meier method","Ghent University Hospital","Cox regression","vessel","months","combination","stand-alone procedure","propensity score","adoption","findings","procedural characteristics","CONCLUSION","difference","matching","prospective database","date"],"language":"en"},

As such, the purpose of this study was to examine walking pattern variability by way of lower extremity coordination and spatio-temporal characteristics in children with autism compared with individuals with typical development during over-ground walking. METHODS Bilateral continuous relative phase variability was computed for the thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot segment couples for 11 children with autism and 9 children with typical development at each gait sub-phase. Furthermore, left and right stride lengths and stride width were computed and compared. The Model Statistic was utilized to test for statistical differences in variability between each child with autism to an aggregate group with typical development. Effect sizes were computed to determine the meaningfulness between responses for children with autism and typical development. Coefficient of variation and effect sizes were computed for stride lengths and stride width. FINDINGS Analysis revealed that children with autism exhibited differences in variability in each gait sub-phase. Notably, all but two children with autism exhibited lesser variability in all segment couples during terminal swing. Differences in stride lengths were relatively minimal, however, greater coefficient of variation magnitudes in stride width were observed in children with autism.

{"cord_uid":"fp1xh1gk","sha":null,"source_x":"Medline","title":"A systematic review exploring the content and outcomes of interventions to improve psychological safety, speaking up and voice behaviour.","doi":"10.1186/s12913-020-4931-2","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32041595","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND Having psychologically safe teams can improve learning, creativity and performance within organisations. Within a healthcare context, psychological safety supports patient safety by enabling engagement in quality improvement and encouraging staff to speak up about errors. Despite the low levels of psychological safety in healthcare teams and the important role it plays in supporting patient safety, there is a dearth of research on interventions that can be used to improve psychological safety or its related constructs. This review synthesises the content, theoretical underpinnings and outcomes of interventions which have targeted psychological safety, speaking up, and voice behaviour within a healthcare setting. It aims to identify successful interventions and inform the development of more effective interventions. METHODS A key word search strategy was developed and used to search electronic databases (PsycINFO, ABI/Inform, Academic search complete and PubMed) and grey literature databases (OpenGrey, OCLC WorldCat, Espace). Covidence, an online specialised systematic review website, was used to screen records. Data extraction, quality appraisal and narrative synthesis were conducted on identified papers. RESULTS Fourteen interventions were reviewed. These interventions fell into five categories. Educational interventions used simulation, video presentations, case studies and workshops while interventions which did not include an educational component used holistic facilitation, forum play and action research meetings. Mixed results were found for the efficacy or effectiveness of these interventions. While some interventions showed improvement in outcomes related to psychological safety, speaking up and voice, this was not consistently demonstrated across interventions. Included interventions\u0027 ability to demonstrate improvements in these outcomes were limited by a lack of objective outcome measures and the ability of educational interventions alone to change deeply rooted speaking up behaviours. CONCLUSION To improve our understanding of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions targeting psychological safety, speaking up and voice behaviour, longitudinal and multifaceted interventions are needed. In order to understand whether these interventions are successful, more objective measures should be developed. It is recommended that future research involves end users in the design phase of interventions, target both group and organisational levels, ensure visible leader support and work across and within interdisciplinary teams.

Evidence of the benefits of vitamin C (VC) for the treatment of sepsis is accumulating. However, data revealing the targets and molecular mechanisms of VC action against sepsis are limited. In this report, a bioinformatics analysis of network pharmacology was conducted to demonstrate screening targets, biological functions, and the signaling pathways of VC action against sepsis. As shown in network assays, 63 primary causal targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified from the data, and four optimal core targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified. These core targets were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), proto-oncogene c (JUN), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). In addition, all biological processes (including a top 20) and signaling pathways (including a top 20) potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis were identified. The hub genes potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis and interlaced networks from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Mapper assays were highlighted. Considering all the bioinformatic findings, we conclude that VC antisepsis effects are mechanistically and pharmacologically implicated with suppression of immune dysfunction-related and inflammation-associated functional processes and other signaling pathways.

This cell subset is activated in a TCR-dependent and MHC-unrestricted fashion by so-called phosphoantigens (PAgs). PAgs can be microbial [(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate, HMBPP] or endogenous (isopentenyl pyrophosphate, IPP) and PAg sensing depends on the expression of B7-like butyrophilin (BTN3A, CD277) molecules. IPP increases in some transformed or aminobisphosphonate-treated cells, rendering those cells a target for V\u03B39V\u03B42 T cells in immunotherapy. Yet, functional V\u03B39V\u03B42 T cells have only been described in humans and higher primates.

T cell receptor (TCR) transductants and BTN3-deficient human 293T cells reconstituted with alpaca or human BTN3 or alpaca/human BTN3 chimeras showed that alpaca V\u03B39V\u03B42 TCRs recognize PAg in the context of human and alpaca BTN3. Furthermore, alpaca BTN3 mediates PAg recognition much better than human BTN3A1 alone and this improved functionality mapped to the transmembrane/cytoplasmic part of alpaca BTN3.

Our preliminary deep sequencing analysis showed altered expression of CTBP1-AS2 in osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, CTBP1-AS2 was inversely correlated with miR-130a. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in OA. METHODS Synovial fluid was collected from 62 OA patients and 62 healthy controls. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression levels of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in synovial fluid. Cell transfections were performed to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to assess the effects of CTBP1-AS2 on the methylation of miR-130a. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the roles of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in regulating proliferation of chondrocytes. RESULTS The results showed that CTBP1-AS2 was upregulated in OA and inversely correlated with miR-130a. In chondrocytes of OA patients, overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to increased methylation of miR-130a gene and downregulated expression of miR-130a, while overexpression of miR-130a did not affect the expression of CTBP1-AS2. In contrast, no interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a was observed in chondrocytes from healthy adults. Analysis of chondrocyte proliferation showed that overexpression of miR-130a led to increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes extracted from OA patients. Overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to decreased proliferation rate of chondrocytes and reversed the effects of overexpressing miR-130a. CONCLUSION Therefore, CTBP1-AS2 is upregulated in OA and may increase the methylation of miR-130a gene to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation.Key Points\u2022 CTBP1-AS2 is overexpressed in OA and may downregulate miR-130a through methylation to suppress the proliferation of chondrocytes.\u2022 The interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a is indirect and mediated by certain pathological mediators.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hongfei; Li, Jinglian; Shao, Weiguang; Shen, Naipeng","journal":"Clinical rheumatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05113-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of CTBP1","overexpression of miR","roles of CTBP1","effects of CTBP1","OBJECTIVES LncRNA CTBP1-AS2","increased methylation of miR","altered expression of CTBP1","expression levels of CTBP1","downregulated expression of miR","effects of overexpressing miR","proliferation of chondrocytes","chondrocytes of OA patients","increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes","decreased proliferation rate of chondrocytes","Analysis of chondrocyte proliferation","Methylation-specific PCR","gene","interactions","results","METHODS Synovial fluid","healthy controls","healthy adults","Cell transfections","preliminary deep sequencing analysis","Key Points","cardiomyocyte hypertrophy","osteoarthritis","certain pathological mediators","type","diabetes","CCK","human diseases","MSP","Kit","assay","contrast","addition","CONCLUSION","RT-qPCR","study"],"language":"en"},

An empirical model for the description of the temperature dependentR2relaxation rate is proposed by taking into account the temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization. The temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization (\u03B7) and the temperature sensitivity of theR2relaxation rate (\u03BA) are simulated with the proposed empirical models to investigate their dependence on the magnetic field and the particle size. Simulation results show the existence of optimal magnetic fieldsH\u03BF\u03B7andH\u03BF\u03BAthat maximize the temperature sensitivities\u03B7and\u03BA. Furthermore, simulations and experiments demonstrate that the optimal magnetic fieldH\u03BF\u03B7(H\u03BF\u03BA) decreases with increasing the particle size. Experiments on temperature dependentR2relaxation rate are performed at different magnetic fields for MNP samples with different iron concentration. Experimental results show that the proposed MR thermometry using MNPs as temperature sensors allows a temperature estimation accuracy of about 0.05 \u00B0C.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is a relation between handedness and the depth of the olfactory sulcus (OS) and reinvestigate whether there is a lateralization of OS depth. METHODS Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean age 24.1 years; 23 right-handed and 19 left-handed) participated. The subjects\u0027 brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess OS depth. Normal olfactory function was ascertained using the Sniffin\u0027 Sticks odor identification test. RESULTS There was no significant difference in OS depth between right- and left-handed participants (right-handed mean: right OS depth = 11.3 mm, left OS = 10.6 mm; left-handed mean: right OS = 11.3 mm, left OS = 11.0 mm). Across all subjects, OS depth was significantly larger on the right side compared to the left. CONCLUSION Handedness has no major influence on OS depth. The present study confirmed that the right OS is deeper compared to the left OS, possibly indicating a right-sided lateralization of the olfactory system. IMPLICATIONS The depth of the right OS is larger than that of the left OS. No major effect of handedness was observed.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zang, Yunpeng; Whitcroft, Katie L; Gl\u00F6ckler, Carmina; Hummel, Thomas","journal":"ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["right OS depth","left OS","lateralization of OS depth","right-sided lateralization","left-handed mean","right-handed mean","mean age","left-handed participants","olfactory system","olfactory sulcus","CONCLUSION Handedness","major effect of handedness","present study","Normal olfactory function","major influence","Sniffin","magnetic resonance imaging","functional asymmetry","healthy volunteers","years","significant difference","Sticks odor identification test","METHODS","subjects\u0027 brains","BACKGROUND Structural","biological systems","IMPLICATIONS","RESULTS","aim","relation"],"language":"en"},

Addition of butyrate is also often needed because ABE fermentation does not produce enough butyrate. Here we addressed the problems using Clostridium beijerinckii BGS1 that preferred to produce isopropanol instead of acetone, and co-culturing it with Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25,755 that produced butyrate. Unlike acetone, isopropanol could be converted into ester using lipase and acids. C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25,755 produced acids at pH 6, while C. beijerinckii BGS1 produced mainly solvents at the same pH. When the two strains were co-cultured, more butyrate was produced, leading to a higher titer of esters than the mono-culture of C. beijerinckii BGS1. As the first study reporting the production of isopropyl butyrate from the Clostridium fermentation, this study highlighted the potential use of lipase and co-culture strategy in ester production.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Yonghao; He, Jianzhong; Yang, Kun-Lin; Zhou, Kang","journal":"Journal of industrial microbiology \u0026 biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-020-02279-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Clostridium fermentation","butyl butyrate","Addition of butyrate","Clostridium beijerinckii BGS1","production of isopropyl butyrate","produced acids","Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC","ABE fermentation","acetone-butanol","ester production","Production of esters","co-culture strategy","co-culturing","study","pH","isopropanol","mono-culture","potential use of lipase","higher titer of esters","ethanol","strains","solvents","problems","undesired product"],"language":"en"},

This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. METHODS Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 23, 2020. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases who were immigrated from Wuhan; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 \u0022generations\u0022 was observed. Five asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years and 49 (47.12%) were male. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days, 96 (92.31%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. Average hospital stay was 10 (rang, 8-14) days. CONCLUSIONS Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers, suggesting the timely control measures after the Wuhan shutdown wok well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging. Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison. RESULTS The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8). Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs. 37.0 years, p = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs. 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs. 11.2 pg/L, p = 0.04) were also higher. The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs. 10.0 days, p = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs. 5.0 days, p \u003C 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.012). More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs. 28.1%, p \u003C 0.001). On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group. On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group. CONCLUSION Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators. Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis. Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Minhua; Liu, Ying; Xu, Dan; Zhang, Rongguo; Lan, Lan; Xu, Haibo","journal":"Korean journal of radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","evidence of fibrosis","CONCLUSION Fibrosis","non-fibrosis group","days","formation of pulmonary fibrosis","irregular interface","parenchymal band","CT imaging features","predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development","initial CT imaging","latest follow-up CT imaging","worst-state CT imaging","section CT findings","worst-state CT scan","clinical features","coarse reticular pattern","interstitial thickening","Clinical data","years","female","pg","severe clinical conditions","median age","confirmed COVID","steroid therapy","antiviral therapy","median levels of C","retrospective study","longer-term of hospitalization","METHODS","reactive protein","process","disease","treatment","high inflammatory indicators","MATERIALS","different stages","OBJECTIVE","groups","air bronchogram","interleukin","pleural effusion","comparison"],"language":"en"},

This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than fifty. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and May 17th, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI and smoking status. Obesity groups included: BMI 30-40 kg/m2 and BMI \u2265 40 kg/m2 . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. RESULTS Overall, 3,406 patients were included. 572 (17.0%) of the patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was independently associated with mortality (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.1). For the older population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 - 2.3).

While data are available for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), limited reports have analyzed pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Objective To evaluate currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence Review An extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, by combining the terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Retrospective cross-sectional and case-control studies, case series and case reports, bulletins, and national reports about the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The risk of bias for eligible observational studies was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. Findings A total of 815 articles were identified. Eighteen studies with 1065 participants (444 patients were younger than 10 years, and 553 were aged 10 to 19 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. All articles reflected research performed in China, except for 1 clinical case in Singapore. Children at any age were mostly reported to have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or were asymptomatic. Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features, and these findings were also reported in asymptomatic patients. Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant. No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years. Available data about therapies were limited. Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castagnoli, Riccardo; Votto, Martina; Licari, Amelia; Brambilla, Ilaria; Bruno, Raffaele; Perlini, Stefano; Rovida, Francesca; Baldanti, Fausto; Marseglia, Gian Luigi","journal":"JAMA pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Observational Studies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus infection","pediatric SARS-CoV","pediatric patients","confirmed SARS-CoV","case reports","clinical case","clinical studies","case-control studies","pediatric cases of SARS","asymptomatic patients","included articles","Reporting of Observational Studies","case of severe COVID","case series","adult patients","years","eligible observational studies","coronavirus disease","clinical features","terms coronavirus","limited reports","Available data","management of children","rapid spread of COVID","national reports","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","US data","Findings","effective preventive strategies","Preferred Reporting Items","Epidemiology reporting guideline","Systematic Reviews","therapeutic strategies","main radiologic features","optimal medical management","mild respiratory symptoms","ground-glass opacities","electronic databases","fever","PubMed","bulletins","Cochrane Library","Meta-analyses guidelines","lack of European","global effort","dry cough","CINAHL","Bronchial thickening","fatigue","risk of bias","China","extensive search strategy","Evidence","knowledge","globe","participants","Conclusions","Relevance","Importance","research","Objective","final analysis","therapies","total","Singapore","month-old infant","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Efforts to increase participation in CRC screening have not met national goals. We developed a novel approach: building a business case for philanthropic investment in CRC screening. METHODS A taskforce representing the public health community, professional societies, charitable foundations, academia, and industry was assembled to: (a) quantify the impact of improving CRC screening rates; (b) identify barriers to screening; (c) estimate the \u0022activation cost\u0022 to overcome barriers and screen one additional person; (d) develop a holistic business case that is attractive to philanthropists; and (e) launch a demonstration project. RESULTS We estimated that of 50 600 CRC deaths annually in the US, 55% occur in 50- to 85-year-olds and are potentially addressable by improvements in CRC screening. Barriers to screening were identified in all patient journey phases, including lack of awareness or insurance and logistical challenges in the pre-physician phase. The cost to activate one person to undergo screening was $25-175. This translated into a cost of $6000-36 000 per CRC death averted by philanthropic investment. Based on this work, the Colorectal Cancer Alliance launched the effort \u0022March Forth\u0022 to prevent 100 000 CRC deaths in the US over 10 years, with the first pilot in Philadelphia.

This study aimed at investigating the response of SP/hrpZPsph-expressing plants under cadmium stress. Transgenic N. benthamiana lines, homozygous for the SP/hrpZPsph gene, and wild-type plants were exposed to Cd at different stress levels (0, 50, 100, 150 \u03BC\u039C CdCl2). Plants\u0027 response to stress was assessed at germination and at the whole plant level on the basis of physiological and growth parameters, including seed germination percentage, shoot and root length, total chlorophyll content, fresh and dry root weight, as well as overall symptomatology, and Cd content in leaves and roots. At germination phase, significant differences were noted in germination rates and post-germination growth among stress levels, with Cd effects being in most cases analogous to the level applied but also among plant categories. Although seedling growth was adversely affected in all plant categories, especially at high stress level, lines #6 and #9 showed the lowest decrease in root and shoot length over control. The superiority of these lines was further manifested at the whole plant level by the absence of stress-attributed symptoms and the low or zero reduction in chlorophyll content. Interestingly, a differential tissue-specific Cd accumulation pattern was observed in wt- and hrpZPsph-plants, with the former showing an increased Cd content in leaves and the latter retaining Cd in the roots. These data are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying the hrpZPsph-based Cd stress resistance.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitsopoulou, Nikoletta; Lakiotis, Kosmas; Golia, Evangelia E; Khah, Ebrahim M; Pavli, Ourania I","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09204-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SP","Transgenic"],"locations":["Nicotiana"],"keyphrases":["hrpZPsph-plants","hrpZPsph-based Cd stress resistance","plant growth","plant level","hrpZPsph gene","Cd effects","absence of stress","increased Cd content","cadmium stress","high stress level","plant categories","post-germination growth","different stress levels","germination rates","germination phase","root length","growth parameters","seedling growth","benthamiana lines","response of SP","seed germination percentage","total chlorophyll content","Nicotiana benthamiana plants","differential tissue-specific Cd accumulation pattern","wild-type plants","leaves","roots","dry root weight","Plants\u0027 response","proven capable of conferring resistance","rhizomania disease","abiotic stresses","basis of physiological","significant differences","overall symptomatology","attributed symptoms","context of possible mechanisms","reduction","Pseudomonas syringae pv","secretable form","cases analogous","lowest decrease","\u03BC\u039C CdCl2","phaseolicola","control","data","study","superiority"],"language":"en"},

Evidence of the effects of reconfiguration is important for local communities and commissioners and providers of health services. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the evidence regarding effects of service reconfigurations that increase the time/distance for some patients to reach an urgent and emergency care (UEC) facility. We searched seven bibliographic databases from 2000 to February 2019 and used citation tracking and reference lists to identify additional studies. We included studies of any design that compared outcomes for people with conditions requiring emergency treatment before and after service reconfiguration with an associated change in travel time/distance to access UEC. Studies had to be conducted in the UK or other developed countries. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for quasi-experimental studies) were undertaken by a single reviewer with a sample checked for accuracy and consistency. We performed a narrative synthesis of the included studies. Overall strength of evidence was assessed using a previously published method that considers volume, quality and consistency. RESULTS We included 12 studies, of which six were conducted in the USA, two in the UK and four in other European countries. The studies used a variety of observational designs, with before-after and cohort designs being most common. Only two studies included an independent control site/sites where no reconfiguration had taken place. The reconfigurations evaluated in these studies reported relatively small effects on average travel times/distance. DISCUSSION For studies of general UEC populations, there was no convincing evidence as to whether reconfiguration affected mortality risk. However, evidence of increased risk was identified from studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly 1 to 4 years after reconfiguration. Evidence for other conditions was inconsistent or very limited. CONCLUSIONS We found insufficient evidence to determine whether increased distance to UEC increases mortality risk for the general population of people requiring UEC, although this conclusion may not extend to people with specific conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chambers, Duncan; Cantrell, Anna; Baxter, Susan; Turner, Janette; Booth, Andrew","journal":"BMC medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01580-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UEC","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included studies","studies of patients","additional studies","studies of general UEC populations","effects of reconfiguration","quasi-experimental studies","evidence of increased risk","insufficient evidence","convincing evidence","increased distance","access UEC","BACKGROUND Reconfiguration of urgent","Overall strength of evidence","mortality risk","emergency care services","effects of service reconfigurations","emergency treatment","small effects","general population of people","specific conditions","UK","consistency","average travel times","quality assessment","appropriate facility","cohort designs","developed countries","European countries","providers of health services","variety of observational designs","Joanna Briggs Institute checklist","commissioners","local communities","associated change","sites","reference lists","outcomes","independent control site","acute myocardial infarction","sample","volume","systematic review","DISCUSSION","citation tracking","published method","accuracy","Data extraction","single reviewer","narrative synthesis","METHODS","place","years","CONCLUSIONS","bibliographic databases","USA"],"language":"en"},

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of \u003E1 month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. RESULTS Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS Lung transplantation can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jing-Yu; Qiao, Kun; Liu, Feng; Wu, Bo; Xu, Xin; Jiao, Guo-Qing; Lu, Rong-Guo; Li, Hui-Xing; Zhao, Jin; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Li, Jia-Shu; Jiang, Shu-Yun; Wang, Da-Peng; Hu, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Gui-Long; Huang, Dong-Xiao; Jiao, Guo-Hui; Wei, Dong; Ye, Shu-Gao; Huang, Jian-An; Zhou, Li; Zhang, Xiao-Qin; He, Jian-Xing","journal":"Chinese medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lives of patients","male patients","end-stage patients","BACKGROUND Critical patients","COVID","LT procedures","post-LT","LT team collaboration","end-stage pulmonary fibrosis","irreversible fatal respiratory failure","medical staffs","medical teams","related pulmonary fibrosis","pathological results","CONCLUSIONS Lung transplantation","negative virology status","maximal medical support","high sequential organ failure assessment","organ dysfunction","acute respiratory distress syndrome","sole therapy","coronavirus disease","nucleic acid test results","rehabilitation program","virology detection tools","critical clinical manifestation","ultimate rescue therapy","modern communication technology","proper protection of transplant surgeons","insight","month","SOFA","Government health affair systems","key roles","explanted lungs","certain death","progress","goal","final option","perioperative logistics","assent","scores","survival","instant seamless care","illness durations","better understanding","mortality rate","Pearls","recipients","ethical review","family","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

MAIN BODY The Herpesviridae family uses a number of proteins that are responsible for host shutoff by directly targeting messenger RNA (mRNA), including virion host shutoff (VHS) protein and the immediate-early regulatory protein ICP27 of herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and the SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) protein and its homologs in Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies, although these proteins are not homologous. In this review, we highlight evidence that host shutoff is promoted by the VHS, ICP27 and SOX-like proteins and that they also contribute to immune evasion. CONCLUSIONS Further studies regarding the host shutoff proteins will not only contribute to provide new insights into the viral replication, expression and host immune evasion process, but also provide new molecular targets for the development of antiviral drugs and therapies.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Tianqiong; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Liu, Mafeng; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Zhao, Xin-Xin; Huang, Juan; Sun, Di; Mao, Sai; Ou, Xuming; Wang, Yin; Xu, Zhiwen; Chen, Zhengli; Zhu, Lin; Luo, Qihui; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue","journal":"Virology journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01336-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host shutoff proteins","virion host shutoff","BACKGROUND Host shutoff","host immune evasion process","evasion of host antiviral immune responses","widespread downregulation of host gene expression","number of proteins","viral replication","VHS","SOX","new insights","key process","immediate-early regulatory protein ICP27 of herpes simplex virus types","development of antiviral drugs","new molecular targets","reallocation of cellular resources","HSV","Herpesviridae family","mRNA","messenger RNA","homologs","Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies","exonuclease","studies","MAIN BODY","therapies","evidence","CONCLUSIONS","review"],"language":"en"},

Recent pediatric data suggest that existing WHO dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal. The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19. A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in AUC0-70h the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared to adults. Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3300 mg in any patient. Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses. The knowledge-driven, model-informed dose selection paradigm can serve as a science-based alternative to recommend pediatric dosing when pediatric clinical trial data is absent.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verscheijden, Laurens F M; van der Zanden, Tjitske M; van Bussel, Lianne P M; de Hoop-Sommen, Marika; Russel, Frans G M; Johnson, Trevor N; de Wildt, Saskia N","journal":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320477/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric CHQ doses","adults","children of different ages","overall CHQ exposure","CHQ base","pediatric dosing guidelines","optimal CHQ dose","age-adjusted CHQ dosing","Recent pediatric data","pediatric clinical trial data","drug exposure","toxic doses","Revised doses","published pharmacokinetic data","study","following total cumulative doses","differences","science-based alternative","months","model-informed dose selection paradigm","Infectious Disease Control COVID","age band","predicted adult value","recommended adult dosage regimen","experimental treatment guideline","Dutch Centre","order","best-evidence","AUC0","body-weight","extent of variation","Simulations","malaria","PBPK","knowledge","years","aim","adolescents","chloroquine","patient"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre. Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply. This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources. Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare. The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new. From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice. Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of \u0027equals should be treated equally\u0027 may no longer be applicable. Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mannelli, Chiara","journal":"Journal of medical ethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["allocation of scarce resources","implications of scarce resources allocation","scarcity of resources","devastating effects of scarce resources allocation","appropriate additional financial resources","ethical perspective","critical care","burden of care","current emergency","prioritisation criteria","prioritisation of patients","proposed analysis","healthcare system","new epicentre","national emergency framework","medical ethics perspective","significant ethical concerns","demand","northern region","news","present clinical practice","right","European country","relevance","need","novelty","intense debate","coronavirus","COVID","choice","individual","remote chances","World Health Organization","high number of people","China","outbreak","supply","Professionals","pandemic","physicians","principle","equals","Italy"],"language":"en"},

The current disposal of solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it\u0027s in immediate need to shift the existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the \u0022Zero Waste\u0022 concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management.

Humic acid urea (HAU) and polyaspartic acid urea (PAU) are two similar synergistic nitrogen fertilizers. METHODS Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13 CNMR) were used to determine the loading of urea-N into the humic acid (HA) and polyaspartic acid (PA). Thermal stability and physical adsorption properties of HAU and PAU were assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface measurement. The soil incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAU and PAU on nitrogen transformation and gaseous nitrogen loss compared with commercial urea. RESULTS Nitrogen transformation from FAU and PAU was slowed down compared with urea. After 90 days of incubation, HAU and PAU reduced the cumulative NH3 volatilization (by 9.70% and 6.30%, respectively) and N2 O emission (by 40.48% and 43.00%, respectively) from soil compared with the urea-alone treatment.

Furthermore, elective clinics and operations have been reduced in order to mobilize manpower to the acute specialties combatting the outbreak; appropriate differentiation between patients who require immediate care and those who can receive telephone consultation or whose treatment might viably be postponed is therefore crucial. Italy was one of the earliest and hardest-hit European countries and therefore the Italian Skull Base Society board has promulgated specific recommendations based on consensus best practices and the literature, where available. Only urgent surgical operations are recommended and all patients should be tested at least twice (on days 4 and 2 prior to surgery). For positive patients, procedures should be postponed until after swab test negativization. If the procedure is vital to the survival of the patient, FFP3 and/or PAPRs devices, goggles, full-face visor, double gloves, water-resistant gowns and protective caps, are mandatory. For negative patients, use of at least FFP2 mask is recommended. In all cases the use of drills, which promote the aerosolization of potentially infected mucous particles, should be avoided.

METHODS A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OB\u2A7E30%, DL\u2A7E0.18, and HL \u2A7E4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD. CONCLUSION This network pharmacology-based exploration revealed that GX II might prevent and inhibit the primary pathological processes of CHD.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheng, Song; Yang, Zhi-Xu; Xu, Feng-Qin; Huang, Ye","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3199-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Guanxin II","CHD","GEO","GX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["big hub targets","targets of GX","common targets of compound targets","big hub compounds","candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets","C-T network","T-D network","primary pathological processes of CHD","network pharmacology-based exploration","network pharmacology-based method","lipid metabolism","steroid metabolism","DrugBank","docking results","excellent binding capacity","reactive oxygen species metabolism","Genomes analysis","KEGG analysis","molecular docking simulation strategy","inflammatory response","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","proliferation","degree","betweenness","coreness","SwissTargetPrediction","treatment of coronary heart disease","formula","Gene Ontology","differentiation","BATMAN-TCM","closeness","PharmMapper","METHODS","CONCLUSION","GeneCards","pharmacological mechanism of Guanxin","contribution index","centrality properties","following criteria","addition","apoptosis","DisGenet","OBJECTIVE","enriched terms"],"language":"en"},

This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world.

Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART). It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-\u00E0-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"David, Adamson; Zev, Rosenwaks; Van Der Spuy, Zephne; D\u00EDaz Yamal, Ivonne","journal":"International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["medical practice","medical interventions","elective procedures","medical facilities","patients","non-emergent medical conditions","paralyzed healthcare systems","various mitigating strategies","essential ART treatments","individual isolation","enormous impact","discontinuation of fertility care services","radical change","assisted reproductive technologies","social distancing","borders","viral pandemic","enigmatic nature","disease transmission","greatest global health challenges","humankind","bewildering spread","SARS-CoV","absence of specific","explosive rise","unprecedented COVID","China","ability","hospitals","world","editorial","Italy","past","months","scope"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search. RESULTS A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes. High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials. At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov. Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020. CONCLUSION Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro.

METHODS This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course. RESULTS Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics. Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread. Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population.

Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Catharine M; Fishman, Douglas S; Lerner, Diana G","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric procedures","Pediatric endoscopic procedures","stratifying procedures","Procedures Committee","pediatric patients","Pediatric Gastroenterology","transmission","control of COVID","delivery of endoscopic care","staff","endoscopy services","aim of minimizing COVID","endoscopy facilities","high risk","Appropriate use of PPE","benefits","statement","risks","patient risk stratification","face shield","healthcare delivery","filtering face-piece respirator","droplet precautions","jurisdiction","public health agencies","N95","Hepatology","current recommendations","Nutrition","body water-resistant disposable gown","infection prevention","shoe","visor","contact","caregivers","negative pressure room","NASPGHAN","North American Society","double gloves","facial protection","personal protective equipment","PAPR","FFP2","N99","framework","practical guidance","era of Coronavirus Disease","PAUSE","emerging evidence","critical time","hairnet","supply","guide","decisions","elective"],"language":"en"},

Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was employed as a means of analyzing DNA polymorphisms in six common physiological races of Pgt in China and Ug99. In total, 64 pairs of primers were used for AFLP screening of race-specific molecular markers.

This article reviews what we have learned over the past century about the large-scale outcome of health inequality, and what we know about the behaviour of complex social systems. This combined knowledge provides lessons on the nature of inequality and what effective action on our big goals, like the SDGs, might look like. It argues that economic theories and positivist social theories which have dominated the last 150 years have largely excluded the nature of human connections to each other, and the environment. This exclusion of intimacy has legitimatised arguments that only value-free economic processes matter for macro human systems, and only abstract measurement constitutes valuable social science. Theories of complex systems provide an alternative perspective. One where health inequality is viewed as emergent, and causes are systemic and compounding. Action therefore needs to be intensely local, with power relationships key to transformation. This requires conscious and difficult intervention on the intolerable accumulation of resources; improved reciprocity between social groups; and reversal of system flows, which at present ebb away from the local and those already disadvantaged.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matheson, Anna","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Theories of complex systems","behaviour of complex social systems","macro human systems","positivist social theories","social groups","economic theories","nature of inequality","valuable social science","effective action","SDGs","large-scale outcome of health inequality","nature of human connections","big goals","alternative perspective","Sustainable Development Goals","value-free economic processes matter","intolerable accumulation of resources","improved reciprocity","abstract measurement","reversal of system flows","arguments","difficult intervention","power relationships key","present ebb","lessons","past century","causes","transformation","combined knowledge","levers","exclusion of intimacy","compounding","article reviews","environment","years"],"language":"en"},

Generally, the homogeneity of a battery pack is evaluated by characterizing the cells individually in terms of capacity, mass, impedance. Particularly, high quality electrochemical data heavily relies on the availability of high precision current source to minimize the discrepancy induced by the channel-to-channel variation. Here, a facile and precise measurement method is reported for screening cell-to-cell variations, in which voltage is the only indicator parameter independent of high precision current source. In detail, by connecting the cells in series (CiS), the measurement error of electrochemical data caused by stability and discrepancy of current sources among different charge/discharge equipment can be effectively avoided. The findings of this work showed that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply and sensitively detected with CiS configuration. For example, the relative standard deviation, which is the evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity, was 2.14% based on CiS while it was 0.43% based on individual measurements. The simple and precise CiS measurement is promising for evaluation of cell quality or module integration quality. In addition, this work can also provide a solid foundation for the development of detection algorithms for battery management systems to rapidly monitor battery homogeneity.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Leqiong; Ren, Dongsheng; Wang, Li; Chen, Zonghai; Tian, Guangyu; Amine, Khalil; He, Xiangming","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64174-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CiS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell variations","evaluation of cell quality","screening cell","evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity","battery pack","precise CiS measurement","high quality electrochemical data","ion battery modules","ion cells","CiS configuration","battery management systems","measurement error of electrochemical data","availability of high precision current source","discrepancy of current sources","electrochemical performance of lithium","precise measurement method","work","indicator parameter independent of high precision current source","module integration quality","safety of lithium","channel variation","development of detection algorithms","different charge","stability","life","major role","voltage","discharge equipment","solid foundation","relative standard deviation","terms of capacity","packs","mass","impedance","example","series","past decade","individual measurements","findings","addition"],"language":"en"},

Studies investigating current field-based athletes (\u003E18years) for CVD risk factors according to the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association were screened. Full texts were screened using Covidence and Cochrane criteria. Eligible articles were critically appraised using the AXIS tool. Individual study estimates were assessed by random-effect meta-analyses to examine the overall effect. RESULTS This study was ascribed a 1b evidence level, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. 41 studies were identified, including 5546 athletes from four sports; American football; soccer; rugby and baseball mean ages: 18-28. Despite participation in sport, increased body mass was associated with increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and decreased high-density lipoprotein. Linemen had increased prevalence of hypertension compared to non-athletes. Conflicting findings on fasting glucose were prevalent. There were inconsistencies in screening and reporting of CVD risk factors. Sport specific anthropometric demands were associated with elevated prevalence of CVD risk factors, most notably: elevated body mass; dyslipidemia; elevated systolic blood pressure and; glucose. CONCLUSIONS There are elevated levels of risk for CVD in some athletes, primarily football players. Lifestyle behaviours associated with elite athleticism, particularly football linemen potentially expose players to greater metabolic and CVD risk, which is not completely offset by sport participation.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"McHugh, Cliodhna; Hind, Karen; Cunningham, Joice; Davey, Daniel; Wilson, Fiona","journal":"Journal of science and medicine in sport","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32139313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","CVD"],"locations":["PROSPERO","Cochrane"],"keyphrases":["elevated prevalence of CVD risk factors","reporting of CVD risk factors","elevated levels of risk","current field-based athletes","non-athletes","elevated body mass","increased prevalence of hypertension","elevated systolic blood pressure","American football","football linemen","football players","sport participation","increased body mass","Evidence-based Medicine","Studies","increased total cholesterol","prevalence of cardiovascular disease","low-density lipoprotein","high-density lipoprotein","random-effect meta-analyses","overall effect","fasting glucose","Sport specific anthropometric demands","Eligible articles","American Heart Association","b evidence level","Individual study estimates","DESIGN Meta-analysis","triglycerides","dyslipidemia","European Society of Cardiology","soccer","Oxford Centre","date","elite athleticism","rugby","online database search engines","screening","years","accordance","PRISMA","Conflicting findings","baseball","sports","Covidence","PROSPERO","Lifestyle behaviours","ages","inconsistencies","CONCLUSIONS","Cochrane criteria","language restriction","review","texts","OBJECTIVES","AXIS tool","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists. Thus, it is important to know typical COVID\u201119 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u0142awi\u0144ski, Grzegorz; Lewicka, Ewa","journal":"Kardiologia polska","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.33963/kp.15302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336069/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impacts patients","ill patients","typical COVID","common symptoms of COVID","cardiac manifestations","cardiovascular comorbidities","cardiac injury","cause of coronavirus disease","coronavirus fulminant myocarditis","ICU care","increased cardiac troponin level","concomitant cardiovascular diseases","symptoms of pulmonary involvement","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","elevated N","recommended treatment","possible clinical manifestations","elevated serum C","intensive care unit","common laboratory abnormalities","type natriuretic peptide concentration","terminal pro-B","complications","worse prognosis","admission","SARS","reactive protein","daily practice of cardiologists","addition","incidence of arrhythmias","decreased lymphocyte count","Early recognition","life","dimer concentrations","data","cases","group","lactate dehydrogenase","myalgia","fatigue","fever","cough","expectoration","dyspnea","thrombocytopenia"],"language":"en"},

Boys are at risk of physical inactivity during adolescence; however, in intervention research, they are an under-represented group relative to girls. It is suggested that the school environment may be central to developing interventions that support adolescents in meeting the current PA guidelines. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of school-based physical activity interventions for improving muscular fitness (MF) in adolescent males. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the preferred reporting systems for meta-analyses guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42018091023). Eligible studies were published in English within peer-reviewed articles. Searches were conducted in three databases, with an additional grey literature search in Google Scholar. Studies investigating MF outcomes were included. RESULTS There were 43 data sets identified across 11 studies, from seven countries. Overall methodological quality of the studies was moderate-to-strong. Interventions targeting MF evidenced a small-to-medium effect (g = 0.32, CI 0.17, 0.48, p \u003C 0.00). Subgroup analyses of MF delivery method resulted in small-to-medium effects: upper limb MF measures (g = 0.28, 95% CI - 0.02, 0.58, p = 0.07), lower limb MF measures (g = 0.28, 95% CI 0.09, 0.68, p = 0.03), combined MF activities (g = 0.24, 95% CI - 0.04 to 0.49, p = 0.05), plyometric activities (g = 0.39, 95% CI 0.09, 0.68, p = 0.01), body weight (g = 0.27, 95% CI - 0.10, 0.65, p = 0.15), and traditional MF methods (g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.09, 0.78, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS School-based interventions which aimed to increase MF outcomes in adolescent boys demonstrated small-to-moderate effects. Traditional and plyometric methods of resistance training appear to be the most effective form of PA delivery in adolescent males. More quality research is required to assess the impact of MF delivered in the school environment to inform future intervention design.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cox, Ashley; Fairclough, Stuart J; Kosteli, Maria-Christina; Noonan, Robert J","journal":"Sports medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01215-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31729638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA","MF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CI","MF outcomes","impact of MF","traditional MF methods","combined MF activities","upper limb MF measures","lower limb MF measures","Subgroup analyses of MF delivery method","physical activity interventions","school environment","CONCLUSIONS School-based interventions","meta-analysis","adolescent boys","efficacy of school","adolescent males","Eligible studies","meta-analyses guidelines","girls\u0027 physical activity","current PA guidelines","systematic review","medium effects","moderate effects","plyometric activities","adolescence","intervention research","quality research","effective form of PA delivery","plyometric methods of resistance training","risk of physical inactivity","methodological quality","future intervention design","preferred reporting systems","muscular fitness","additional grey literature search","Google Scholar","English","PROSPERO","boys\u0027","adolescents","levels","under-represented group relative","databases","peer-reviewed articles","body weight","Registration number","CRD42018091023","data sets","aim","RESULTS","Searches","BACKGROUND","countries"],"language":"en"},

Methods: 30 patients infected with novel coronavirus referred to jianghan university hospital between January 11, 2020 and January 3, 2020 were studied. The data reviewed included those of clinical manifestations, laboratory investigation and Radiographic features. Results: The patients consisted of 10 men and 20 women, including 22 doctors and 8 nurses,aged 21~59 years(mean 35\u00B18 years).They were divided to 26 common type and 4 severe cases, all of whom had close(within 1m) contact with patients infected of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%) , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine blood test revealed WBC\u003C4.0\u00D710(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) \u00D710(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC\u003E4.0\u00D710(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count\u003C1.0\u00D710(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (\u003E0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. Conclusion: Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus. Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time prolonged, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection for medical workers.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, M; He, P; Liu, H G; Wang, X J; Li, F J; Chen, S; Lin, J; Chen, P; Liu, J H; Li, C H","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["petients","severe patients","normal patients","Lymphocyte count","bilateral pneumonia","novel coronavirus pneumonia","Fever time","average cumulative contact time","white blood cell count","cumulative exposure time","liver damage","proportion of severe infection","average contact times","Unilateral pneumonia","peripheral blood","Infection rates","myocardial damage","severe cases","heating time prolonged","average exposure times","elevated D-dimer","BMI","liver enzyme","higher risk of infection","Routine blood test","clinical manifestations","clinical characteristics of medical staff","Medical staffs","Clinical symptoms","medical workers","years","WBC","bilateral multiple mottling","abnormal liver function","albumin levels","unprotected period","LDH","Strict protection measures","interstitial changes","ground-glass opacity","patchy shadows","laboratory investigation","Chest CT","myoenzyme","Radiographic features","imaging examination","jianghan university hospital","NCP","Conclusion","common type","fatigue","suction virus","doctors","women","nurses","data","Objective","diarrhea","nausea","myalgia","disease","Methods","cough","headache","dyspnea","Results"],"language":"en"},

Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (\u003E50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for \u003E15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bryan-Brown, Dale N; Connolly, Rod M; Richards, Daniel R; Adame, Fernanda; Friess, Daniel A; Brown, Christopher J","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63880-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cambodia","southern Caribbean","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["Mangrove fragmentation","Mangrove ecosystem services","global hotspot of mangrove loss","broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation","little loss","regional drivers of mangrove deforestation","habitat loss","biggest drivers of loss","forest loss rates","large scale monitoring of mangrove forests","global estimates of mangrove density","associated loss of ecosystem functionality","conversion of forests","important ecosystem services","management of different deforestation drivers","Southeast Asia","major driver of ecosystem degradation","multi-scale analysis","arrangement of forest patches","regional priorities","rice plantations","oil palm plantations","conservation","mitigation of climate change","erosion prevention","shoreline protection","relationships","aquaculture","regions","capacity of habitats","southern Caribbean","geographic disparities","carbon sequestration","work highlights","size","Cambodia","findings"],"language":"en"},

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Ministry of Health of Republic of Turkey and international institutions have published documents defining hygiene rules. After the lung computerized tomography (CT) findings which are important in the diagnosis of COVID-19 are described, protection measures against infection were defined in radiology departments. There is no publication involving protection measures for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in nuclear medicine (NM) (appointment, patient acceptance, imaging and treatment procedures, disinfection etc). There are two reports on CT findings suggesting COVID-19 in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan. These lung findings detected in hybrid images will be helpful in the early diagnosis of pulmonary involvement. Infected cases may be asymptomatic and can unintentionally disseminate the virus to surrounding people. This advisory guide has been prepared to avoid infection risk in NM clinics. During the COVID-19 outbreak, staff must use proper personal protective equipment and patients should be evaluated as the elective case according to clinical status. A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19. In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result. If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.

In this study, the cardiotoxicity of BPAF was evaluated in zebrafish in vivo and in human cardiac myocytes (HCMs) in vitro. Our results showed that BPAF at a concentration of 200 \u03BCg/L results in cardiotoxicity, including a reduced number of cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells in the heart, and reduced heart size in two transgenic zebrafish models (myl7:: dsred2-nuc and fli1a::nGFP). An increase in apoptosis was observed along with antioxidant enzyme inhibition and lipid peroxidation. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of several key genes involved in cardiac development were suppressed by BPAF treatment. In the HCM cell model, BPAF at 2 mg/L induced reactive oxygen species generation, antioxidant enzyme inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative DNA damage. These adverse outcomes can be attenuated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity. These data indicated that BPAF exposure increased oxidative stress and apoptosis and that it suppressed the expression of genes involved in cardiac development, which may play crucial roles in the mechanisms of BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Jie; Wang, Hongye; Zhou, Linjun; Fan, Deling; Shi, Lili; Ji, Guixiang; Gu, Aihua","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BPAF","HCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiotoxicity of BPAF","BPAF exposure","BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity","mechanisms of BPAF","BPAF treatment","heart development","cardiac development","oxidative stress","antioxidant enzyme inhibition","reduced heart size","expression of genes","apoptosis","results","antioxidant N-acetyl","oxidative DNA damage","human cardiac myocytes","key genes","transgenic zebrafish models","reduced number of cardiomyocytes","mRNA expression levels","effect of bisphenol AF","mitochondrial dysfunction","reactive oxygen species generation","endocardial cells","myl7","main substitute","dsred2-nuc","crucial roles","NAC","lipid peroxidation","concentration","\u03BCg","incidence of cardiovascular diseases","fli1a","cysteine","addition","HCMs","HCM cell model","data","nGFP","relationship","study","adverse outcomes","increase","Research"],"language":"en"},

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n = 50 patients, n = 84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher N; Weber, Andrew; Barnes, Betsy J; Egeblad, Mikala; Woods, Robert J; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S","journal":"JCI insight","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.138999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-free DNA","MPO-DNA","hospitalized patients","high levels of NETs","severe COVID","role of NETs","lungs of patients","elevated levels of cell","specific markers of NETs","Cit-H3","elevated levels of blood neutrophils","predictive power of circulating NETs","platelet levels","respiratory failure","absolute neutrophil count","Neutrophil extracellular traps","control neutrophils","sera","acute respiratory distress syndrome","citrullinated histone H3","cytokine release","acute phase reactants","extracellular webs of chromatin","triggered NET release","potential clinical relevance","severe cases of coronavirus disease","C-reactive protein","microbicidal proteins","mechanical ventilation","findings","D-dimer","longitudinal cohorts","worse outcomes","novel therapeutic targets","samples","myeloperoxidase","oxidant enzymes","lactate dehydrogenase","microvascular thrombosis","extent","individuals","inflammation","data","viral pneumonia","Future studies","summary","room air","infections"],"language":"en"},

Since US findings are based on pathological features, knowledge of pathological features is essential for delivering a correct US diagnosis. Recent advances in US equipment have made it possible to provide more information, such as malignancy potential and accurate localization diagnosis of HCC. Evaluation of malignancy potential is important to determine the treatment strategy, especially for small HCC. Diagnosis of blood flow dynamics using color Doppler and contrast-enhanced US is one of the most definitive approaches for evaluating HCC malignancy potential. Recently, a new Doppler microvascular imaging technique, superb microvascular imaging, which can detect Doppler signals generated by low-velocity blood flow, was developed. A fusion imaging system, another innovative US technology, has already become an indispensable technology over the last few years not only for US-guided radiofrequency ablation but also for the detection of small, invisible HCC. This article reviews the evidence on the use of ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound with Sonazoid for the practical management of HCC.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanaka, Hironori","journal":"Journal of medical ultrasonics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10396-020-01012-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32170489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCC malignancy potential","US equipment","US findings","small HCC","contrast-enhanced US","correct US diagnosis","invisible HCC","innovative US technology","accurate localization diagnosis of HCC","practical management of HCC","US-guided radiofrequency ablation","Evaluation of malignancy potential","superb microvascular imaging","color Doppler","new Doppler microvascular imaging technique","Doppler signals","contrast-enhanced ultrasound","Diagnosis of blood flow dynamics","detection of small","knowledge of pathological features","fusion imaging system","use of ultrasound","low-velocity blood flow","noninvasive detection","indispensable technology","surveillance method","sustainable hepatocellular carcinoma","Sonazoid","treatment strategy","definitive approaches","years","evidence","Recent advances","information","article","Ultrasonography"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to systematically review the methodological strengths and limitations, as well as the impact of delirium educational interventions for healthcare professionals working in inpatient settings. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines for delirium educational interventions in hospital inpatient settings from 2007 to 2017. Identified studies were rated using a standardised quality assessment criteria checklist (Kmet). Reported outcomes were organised by level on the Kirkpatrick model for educational outcomes. The search was repeated in March 2018. RESULTS 1354 papers were screened, of which 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions delivered included face-to-face education (n = 34), e-learning (n = 8) and interprofessional education (n = 8). Quality of studies varied in Kmet score (14-96%). There were 17 high-quality studies (Kmet \u003E 80%) and 4 very high-quality studies (Kmet over \u003E 90%). Thirty-eight studies (90%) reported improved outcomes post-intervention. In terms of Kirkpatrick level of educational outcomes, 6 studies were rated at level 1; 13 studies at level 2; 15 studies at level 3; and 8 studies at level 4. Thirteen studies measured intervention sustainability with variable impacts. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professional education has benefits for inpatient delirium care, as shown by the high number of good-quality studies and the majority demonstrating improved outcomes post-intervention. The sustainability of educational interventions warrants further exploration.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Song Yuin; Fisher, James; Wand, Anne P F; Milisen, Koen; Detroyer, Elke; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Agar, Meera; Hosie, Annmarie; Teodorczuk, Andrew","journal":"European geriatric medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-019-00278-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kirkpatrick"],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Quality of studies","delirium education studies","high-quality studies","impact of delirium educational interventions","sustainability of educational interventions","terms of Kirkpatrick level of educational outcomes","future education interventions","inpatient delirium care","delirium prevention","interprofessional education","improved outcomes post-intervention","quality of evidence","intervention sustainability","Kmet score","included face-to-face education","CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professional education","hospital inpatient settings","standardised quality assessment criteria checklist","healthcare professionals","Kirkpatrick model","inclusion criteria","majority","Cochrane Library","PRISMA guidelines","CINAHL databases","EMBASE","PsychINFO","detection","high number of good","well-known deficits","variable impacts","METHODS MEDLINE","limitations","exploration","methodological strengths","e-learning","study","PURPOSE","RESULTS","papers","aim","search"],"language":"en"},

The simulation using Artificial Intelligence and robotics could contribute significantly to the definition, experimentation, and validation of the models that make up the theories of psychology in its different domains, enhancing the interdisciplinarity with other sciences that study the same objects.

The ELISA, using horse\u2010radish peroxidase as enzyme and 5 amino\u2010salicylic acid as indicator, was very specific and showed a higher sensitivity compared to IEM. In 18 out of the 136 positive samples rotavirus could only be demonstrated by IEM; these samples were negative in the ELISA. It is assumed that these samples contain virus\u2010antibody complexes. Further investigations are necessary before the ELISA can be recommended as a routine diagnostic test.

RESUMEN: Identificaci\u00F3n de virus Rota en heces: Experiencia con el Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Se examinaron comparativamente 313 muestras de heces de terneros, 47 de lechones y 100 de ni\u00F1os, pacientes reci\u00E9n enfermos de diarrea, con ayuda de una t\u00E9cnica modificada de inmunomicroscop\u00EDa de electrones (IEM) y en el Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). En 113 muestras de heces de terneros (36 %), 2 de lechones (4 %) y 21 de ni\u00F1os (21 %) se pudo identificar virus o ant\u00EDgeno Rota. La seguridad de la metodolog\u00EDa se control\u00F3 adem\u00E1s con ayuda de la eliminaci\u00F3n de virus por tres terneros infectados experimentalmente, criados sin calostro. El ELISA, en el que se utiliz\u00F3 peroxidasa de r\u00E1bano rusticano como enzima, era espec\u00EDfico, resultando ser m\u00E1s sensible en comparaci\u00F3n con la IEM. Solo en 18 de un total de 136 muestras positivas se logr\u00F3 la identificaci\u00F3n de virus con la IEM, siendo estas pruebas negativas en el ELISA. Se sospecha que en estas muestras hab\u00EDa complejos de anticuerpos de virus. Se precisa proseguir con las experiencias antes de poder recomendar el ELISA para la identificaci\u00F3n de virus Rota en el diagn\u00F3stico de rutina. An dieser Stelle m\u00F6chte ich Dr. D. Ellens und Dr. P. de Leeuw, Central Diergeneeskundig Instituut, Leystad, Holland, sehr herzlich f\u00FCr die \u00DCberlassung von Referenzmaterial und die Hilfe bei der Entwicklung des ELISA in unserem Labor danken.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bachmann, P.

However, many variables need to be considered in performing a reliable PCR assay, ranging from nucleic acid extraction, storage, composition of the PCR reaction mix used, to the dynamics of the amplification reaction. To control for these variables, there is an obvious need for standardised reagents and quality assurance programmes to obtain reproducible and clinically significant results. The diagnostic potential of the PCR technology has been greatly enhanced with the development of multiplex, real-time, and quantitative PCR methods, and these are now routinely performed in many diagnostic laboratories. More recently, PCR has been applied to bacterial typing, and a reasonable prediction is that in the near future, bacterial typing will be performed by either some variant of next-generation sequencing, or by HRM analysis of selected markers, depending on the amount of information required.","publish_time":"2010-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carter, Ian; Halliday, Catriona; Sloots, Theo P.; Pryce, Todd M.; Kay, Ian D.; Harnett, Gerald B.; Chidlow, Glenys R.; Giffard, Philip M.","journal":"PCR for Clinical Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9575e3f148bc5992ee39a4fb4d6b45897ca93004.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193708.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR technology","PCR methodologies","PCR reaction mix","quantitative PCR methods","reliable PCR assay","diagnostic laboratories","traditional diagnostic methods","bacterial typing","diagnostic potential","variables","obvious need","amplification reaction","clinical laboratories","rapidity","composition","quality assurance programmes","standardised reagents","nucleic acid extraction","storage","major advantages of improved sensitivity","detection","reasonable prediction","near future","generation sequencing","HRM analysis of selected markers","wide range of organisms","dynamics","development of multiplex","significant results","variant","information"],"language":"en"},

We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV). A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici\u2010, parvo\u2010 and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host fitness suggest that these viruses do not affect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health effects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity.","publish_time":"2001-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Packer, C.; Altizer, S.; Appel, M.; Brown, E.; Martenson, J.; O\u0027Brien, S.

Without this management, license compliance would be impossible, export restrictions could not be maintained, and security vulnerabilities would remain unknown to the vendor. The management of these dependencies has grown in an ad-hoc fashion in most companies. As such, vendors find it hard to learn from each other and improve practices. To address this problem, we performed exploratory single-case study research at one large established software vendor. We gathered and analyzed the key challenges of tracking and documenting open source dependencies in products. We wanted to understand whether these ad-hoc solutions could be based on a single unified conceptual model for managing dependencies. Our study suggests that underlying the various point solutions that we found at this vendor lies a conceptual model that we tentatively call the product (architecture) model. In future cross-vendor work, we will investigate whether this conceptual model can be expanded to become a unifying model for all open source dependency management.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bauer, Andreas; Harutyunyan, Nikolay; Riehle, Dirk; Schwarz, Georg-Daniel","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/694b5ad609e3048dedcc0b6bff47bb145f01dfad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["open source dependencies","unifying model","single unified conceptual model","open source dependency management","open source components","large established software vendor","products","Software vendors","ad","future cross-vendor work","exploratory single-case study research","various point solutions","license compliance","key challenges of tracking","export restrictions","security vulnerabilities","fashion","companies","problem","architecture","practices"],"language":"en"},

In addition, they often learn a single vector for each user involved in two domains, which is insufficient to reveal user\u2019s complex interests to both items and friends. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we consider modeling the user-item interactions and social relations simultaneously and propose a novel metric learning-based model called RML-DGATs. Specifically, relations in two domains are modeled as two types of relation vectors, with which each user can be regarded as being translated to both multiple item-aware and social-aware representations. Then we model the relation vectors by neighborhood interactions with two carefully designed dual GATs to fully encode the neighborhood information. Finally, the two parts are jointly trained under a dual metric learning framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline by 1.91% to 4.74% on three metrics for top-N recommendation and the performance gains are more significant under the cold-start scenarios.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaodong; Liu, Zhen; Wang, Nana; Fan, Wentao","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65e8836f1423b33d14c32c642d2fc0f68364fd9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social relations","social connections","social-aware representations","user-item interactions","Existing social recommenders","user preference modeling","neighborhood interactions","domains","novel metric learning-based model","dual metric learning framework","multiple item-aware","types of relation vectors","dual GATs","neighborhood information","common interests","user\u2019s complex interests","performance gains","N recommendation","items","real-world datasets","RML-DGATs","Extensive experiments","friends","single vector","scenarios","metrics","best baseline","paper","issues","addition","parts"],"language":"en"},

A bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network is trained to match binary programs with their sequence of action states.

However, few works utilize the extra structural information to generate embeddings. In this paper, we propose a new zero-shot scenario: how to acquire the embedding vector of a relation that is not observed at training time. Our work uses a convolutional transition and attention-based aggregation graph neural network to solve both the OOKG entity problem and the new OOKG relation problem without retraining, regarding the structural neighbors as the auxiliary information.

The exact technique utilizes pattern matching to find the set of drifted trees, that co-occurred in predictions in the past. Meanwhile, a probabilistic graphical model is being built to capture the tree replacements among recurrent concept drifts. Once the graphical model becomes stable, it replaces the exact technique and finds relevant trees in a probabilistic fashion. Further, Lossy Counting is applied to the graphical model which brings an added theoretical guarantee for both error rate and space complexity. We empirically show our technique outperforms baselines in terms of cumulative accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ocean; Koh, Yun Sing; Dobbie, Gillian; Lacombe, Thomas","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20488171771062895127afbb276541247cf2b0e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEARL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relevant trees","exact technique","probabilistic graphical model","trained trees","new trees","set of drifted trees","state-of-the-art technique","Lossy Counting","recurrent concept drifts","probabilistic fashion","past","recurrent patterns","error rate","added theoretical guarantee","dynamic nature of data streams","terms of cumulative accuracy","random forests","baselines","tree replacements","real-world datasets","space complexity","novel framework","PEARL","predictions","order"],"language":"en"},

Existing methods rely on Electronic Health Records (EHR) as their only information source and do not make use of abundant available external medical knowledge, and therefore they ignore the correlations between medical concepts. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-information source Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) to model EHR while incorporating external medical knowledge including ICD-9-CM and MeSH for an enriched network schema. Our model is well aware of the structure of EHR as well as the correlations between medical concepts it refers to, and learns semantically reflective medical concept embeddings. In experiments, our model outperforms unsupervised baselines in a variety of medical data mining tasks.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Yuwei; Peng, Hao; Yu, Philip S.","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dc33680880653973ec260220b2c9d025a921e37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Electronic Health Records","Heterogeneous Information Network","EHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical concepts","model EHR","reflective medical concept embeddings","use of abundant available external medical knowledge","variety of medical data mining tasks","structure of EHR","correlations","novel multi-information source Heterogeneous Information Network","enriched network schema","HIN","great importance","public healthcare applications","unsupervised baselines","Electronic Health Records","computer-aided diagnosis systems","low-dimensional representations","Existing methods","MeSH","ICD","experiments","issue"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas. The fundamental task in XML schema inference is to learn regular expressions. In this paper, we focus on learning the subclass of RE(\u0026) called SIREs (the subclass of regular expressions with interleaving). Previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples. We provide an algorithm to learn SIREs from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Our algorithm also has better expansibility, which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples, but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yeting; Chen, Haiming; Zhang, Lingqi; Huang, Bo; Zhang, Jianzhao","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative examples","XML schema inference","inference algorithms","learning","XML documents","valid schema","genetic algorithms","SIREs","subclass of regular expressions","direction","numerous advantages","fundamental task","Previous work","parallel techniques","effectiveness","interleaving","presence","practice","Experimental results","better expansibility","schemas","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, most event recorder (ER) data shows only regular driving events. To utilize near-miss data for safe-driving education, we need to be able to easily and rapidly locate the appropriate data from large amounts of ER data through labels attached to the scenes/events of interest. This paper proposes a method that can automatically identify near-misses with objects such as pedestrians and bicycles by processing the ER data. The proposed method extracts two deep feature representations that consider car status and the environment surrounding the car. The first feature representation is generated by considering the temporal transitions of car status. The second one can extract the positional relationship between the car and surrounding objects by processing object detection results. Experiments on actual ER data demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify and tag near-miss events.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamamoto, Shuhei; Kurashima, Takeshi; Toda, Hiroyuki","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/629b3e45747723ae17f34388df923f9ae7cdbc30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensor data","appropriate data","actual ER data","traffic incident data","large amounts of ER data","proposed method","regular driving events","surrounding objects","temporal transitions of car status","education","deep feature representations","traffic accident evidence","processing object detection results","vehicle-mounted event recorders","labels","pedestrians","bicycles","positional relationship","video","tag","scenes","Experiments","environment","misses","paper"],"language":"en"},

To address this gap, we introduce an attention-based graph evolution model (AGE). AGE is a conditional graph generator based on the neural attention mechanism that can not only model graph evolution in both space and time, but can also model the transformation between graphs from one state to another. We evaluate AGE on multiple conditional graph-generation tasks, and our results show that it can generate realistic graphs conditioned on source graphs, outperforming existing methods in terms of quality and generality.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Shuangfei; Huang, Bert","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b575fd33c74cb88c5fcb2256e06ef410ecf27f27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206304.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model graph evolution","AGE","source graphs","realistic graphs","attention-based graph evolution model","conditional graph generator","multiple conditional graph-generation tasks","continuous data","existing methods","unconditioned generation","discrete data","various new methods","neural attention mechanism","recent success of deep generative models","terms of quality","control","context","generating procedure","space","applicability","generality","results","time","real-world settings","approaches","transformation","state","gap"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit. RESULTS A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p\u003C0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p\u003C0.001). Log hs-TnT was associated with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 19.65), and all of the three deaths occurred in patients with acute myocardial injury. CONCLUSION Acute myocardial injury is common in patients with covid-19 and is associated with adverse prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Jia-Fu; Huang, Fang-Yang; Xiong, Tian-Yuan; Liu, Qi; Chen, Hong; Wang, Hui; Huang, He; Luo, Yi-Chun; Zhou, Xuan; Liu, Zhi-Yue; Peng, Yong; Xu, Yuan-Ning; Wang, Bo; Yang, Ying-Ying; Liang, Zong-An; Lei, Xue-Zhong; Ge, Yang; Yang, Ming; Zhang, Ling; Zeng, Ming-Quan; Yu, He; Liu, Kai; Jia, Yu-Heng; Prendergast, Bernard D; Li, Wei-Min; Chen, Mao","journal":"Heart","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSION Acute myocardial injury","cohort of patients","immediate clinical implications of acute myocardial injury","vs","hs-TnT value","Log hs-TnT","vasoactive agents","treatment centres","classification of disease severity","ICU admission","designated covid","mechanical ventilation","normal upper limit","years","higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease","value of high","medical records","medical resources","laboratory results","region of China","sensitivity troponin T","chest CT images","medication","intensive care unit","Wuhan","IQR","Sichuan","epicentre","average age","deaths","pandemic","Outcomes","METHODS","CI","total","cases","adverse prognosis","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children\u0027s and women\u0027s hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. CONCLUSION We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brandstetter, Susanne; Roth, Samra; Harner, Susanne; Buntrock-D\u00F6pke, Heike; Toncheva, Antoaneta; Borchers, Natascha; Gruber, Rudolf; Ambrosch, Andreas; Kabesch, Michael","journal":"Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","cases","number of SARS","Study participants","massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV","specific antibody responses","relevant antibody responses","onset of symptoms","exposure","symptoms indicative","development of measurable immune responses","weeks","elevated IgG","hospital setting","outbreak","IgA values","significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons","significant number of diseased","development of immune mechanisms","women\u0027s hospital","chains of infection","symptom onset","asymptomatic individuals","clinical setting","contact history","Serological immunoglobulin tests","major German children\u0027s","staff members","large sample of health care workers","positive co-workers","anosmia","coughing","opportunity","groups","CONCLUSION","ELISA","BACKGROUND","METHODS","data","infections","aim","Subjects"],"language":"en"},

There is widespread belief that small aneurysms \u003C 7 mm do not rupture. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the size of ruptured aneurysms according to aneurysm locations and methods of size estimation. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We included articles that reported mean aneurysm size in consecutive series of ruptured intracranial. We excluded studies limited to a specific aneurysm location or type. The random-effects model was used to calculate overall mean size and location-specific mean size. We performed meta-regression to explain observed heterogeneity and variation in reported size. RESULTS The systematic review included 36 studies and 12,609 ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Overall mean aneurysm size was 7.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI 6.2-7.4]). Pooled mean size varied with location. Overall mean size of 2145 ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms was 6.0 mm (95% CI 5.6-6.4, residual I2 = 86%). Overall mean size of 743 ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms was 6.2 mm (95% CI 5.3-7.0, residual I2 = 93%). Meta-regression identified aneurysm location and definition of size (i.e., maximum dimension vs. aneurysm height) as significant determinants of aneurysm size reported in the studies. CONCLUSIONS The mean size of ruptured aneurysms in most studies was approximately 7 mm. The general wisdom that aneurysms of this size do not rupture is incorrect.

However, there is still a lack of an appropriate cell-based HTS specific for migratory cancer cells. In the study presented here, we created a novel assay (mHTS): a single-cell-level screening method targeting migratory cancer cells and can be applied in a high-throughput manner. This mHTS platform is based on microchannel devices (providing physical confinement during cell migration and limit migrating cells\u0027 proliferation rate) assembled 96-well plate (fitting to HTS manner). To determine the feasibility of this assay, we quantified the anti-migratory and anti-viability effects of several molecules (Cytochalasin D, Doxorubicin and AZD-6244) on migrating (creeping inside microchannel) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. After analyzing migration screening data that was collected on a single-cell-level, we were able to compare those drug\u0027s effects on cancer cells\u0027 migration velocity and uncovered the migration inhibiting potential of AZD (500nM and 1000nM).

Their early detection and management are usually overlooked in routine practice. This study aimed to explore preoperative nutritional status and its prognostic value in patients undergoing surgery for PC. METHODS Data from 73 patients who underwent surgery for PC from November 2015 to January 2018 at the General and Pancreatic Surgery Unit, The Pancreas Institute, University Hospital of Verona Hospital, Verona, Italy, were retrospectively evaluated. The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS)-2002 was used to evaluate the preoperative nutritional risk. Body composition was assessed using bioimpedance vectorial analysis (BIVA) on the day prior to surgery. The effect of clinical, pathological, and nutritional characteristics on overall survival (OS) was investigated using a Cox and logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS Most patients (80.8%) were at preoperative risk of malnutrition (NRS-2002 \u2265 3) despite a mean BMI of 24.1 kg/m2(\u00B1 4.3). Twenty-four patients (32.9%) received neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Preoperative NRS-2002 was significantly higher in this subset of patients (p = 0.026), with a significant difference by chemotherapy regimens (in favor of FOLFIRINOX, p = 0.035). In a multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factor for OS was the NRS-2002 score (HR 5.24, p = 0.013). Particularly, the likelihood of 2-year survival was higher in NRS \u003C 3 (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Our analysis confirms that preoperative malnutrition has a detrimental impact on OS in PC patients undergoing radical surgery for PC. Careful preoperative nutritional evaluation of PC patients should be mandatory, especially in those who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trestini, Ilaria; Paiella, Salvatore; Sandini, Marta; Sperduti, Isabella; Elio, Giovanni; Pollini, Tommaso; Melisi, Davide; Auriemma, Alessandra; Sold\u00E0, Caterina; Bonaiuto, Clelia; Tregnago, Daniela; Avancini, Alice; Secchettin, Erica; Bonamini, Deborah; Lanza, Massimo; Pilotto, Sara; Malleo, Giuseppe; Salvia, Roberto; Bovo, Chiara; Gianotti, Luca; Bassi, Claudio; Milella, Michele","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08515-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Pancreas Institute, University Hospital of Verona Hospital","The Nutritional Risk Screening","NRS"],"locations":["Verona"],"keyphrases":["Preoperative NRS","preoperative nutritional risk","Careful preoperative nutritional evaluation of PC patients","preoperative nutritional status","preoperative malnutrition","subset of patients","preoperative risk of malnutrition","nutritional characteristics","radical surgery","Nutritional Risk Screening","Pancreatic Surgery Unit","BACKGROUND Nutritional derangements","multivariate analysis","neoadjuvant therapy","University Hospital of Verona Hospital","bioimpedance vectorial analysis","prognostic value","overall survival","year survival","independent prognostic factor","common hallmarks of pancreatic cancer","Pancreas Institute","detrimental impact","chemotherapy regimens","BIVA","favor of FOLFIRINOX","management","Cox","score","significant difference","Body composition","logistic regression model","effect of clinical","Italy","day","HR","study","CONCLUSIONS","log-rank test","Kaplan-Meier curves","METHODS Data","mean BMI","m2","early detection","routine practice","likelihood","candidates"],"language":"en"},

Identification of which disaster relief workers may be at risk of experiencing psychological distress or mental health disorders is frequently carried out through pre-employment or pre-deployment psychological screening. The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work. METHODS A combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results. RESULTS Sixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder. CONCLUSION The results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opie, Elena; Brooks, Samantha; Greenberg, Neil; Rubin, G James","journal":"BMC psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02593-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-deployment features","pre-deployment characteristics","psychological distress","specific pre-employment","pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers","pre-deployment indicators of resilience","post-deployment psychological disorders","disaster relief workers","disaster-related work","psychological illnesses","disaster description","disaster situations","screening methods","disaster-related occupations","results","reliable predictors of distress","country of study","sort of screening","validated measure of distress","mental health disorders","longitudinal study designs","evidence base","better evidence","review","high-quality studies","potential predictors","previous history of mental illness","life stressors","population sample","impaired wellbeing","association","risk","year of publication","academic journals","volunteer status","combined list of search terms","MEDLINE","employers","peer","English language","usefulness","outcome","author","occupational groups","BACKGROUND Individuals","PsycINFO","EMBASE","caution","discrete crisis","measures","variety of traumatic events","Identification","worst","databases","GlobalHealth","primary objective","vulnerability","best","discrimination","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grant, William B; Lahore, Henry; McDonnell, Sharon L; Baggerly, Carole A; French, Christine B; Aliano, Jennifer L; Bhattoa, Harjit P","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12040988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern Hemisphere"],"keyphrases":["D concentrations","vitamin D supplementation","d of vitamin D3","role of vitamin D","roles of vitamin D","vitamin D deficiency","hydroxyvitamin D","risk of COVID","risk of influenza","risk of infections","OH","risk of respiratory tract infections","higher vitamin D3 doses","concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines","increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines","epidemiology of influenza","IU","mechanisms","clinical trials","useful measure","observational studies","treatment of people","Randomized controlled trials","case-fatality rates","viral replication rates","large population studies","acute respiratory distress syndrome","age","defensins","knowledge","Southern Hemisphere","end of summer","number of cases","inflammation","time","death","addition","weeks","inducing cathelicidins","chronic disease comorbidity","quarantines","grip","outbreak","pneumonia","article","Evidence","Public health measures","lungs","lining","winter","pandemic","world","goal","nmol","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for surgery involving a placebo are ethically debated and difficult to conduct with many failing to reach their desired sample size and power. A review of the literature on barriers and enablers to recruitment, and patient and surgeon attitudes and preferences towards sham surgery trials, will help to determine the characteristics necessary for successful recruitment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will scope the diverse literature surrounding sham surgery trials with the aim of informing a discrete choice experiment to empirically test patient and surgeon preferences for different sham surgery trial designs. The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the methodological framework described in Arksey and O\u0027Malley (2005) and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols extension for Scoping Reviews. The review will be informed by a systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and EconLit databases (from database inception to 21 June 2019), a Google Scholar search, and hand searching of reference lists of relevant studies or reviews. Studies or opinion pieces that involve patient, surgeon or trial characteristics, which influence the decision to participate in a trial, will be included. Study selection will be carried out independently by two authors with discrepancies resolved by consensus among three authors. Data will be charted using a standardised form, and results tabulated and narratively summarised with reference to the research questions of the review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The findings from this review will inform the design of a discrete choice experiment around willingness to participate in surgical trials, the outcomes of which can inform decision and cost-effectiveness models of sham surgery RCTs. The qualitative information from this review will also inform patient-centred outcomes research. The review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The role and impact of imaging predates this declaration and continues to change rapidly. This article is a consensus statement provided by the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology and the Canadian Association of Radiologists outlining the role of imaging in COVID-19 patients. The objectives are to answer key questions related to COVID-19 imaging of the chest and provide guidance for radiologists who are interpreting such studies during this pandemic. The role of chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography (CT), and lung ultrasound is discussed. This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as \u0022When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?\u0022 or \u0022How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?\u0022 This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided.

Although numerous approaches for PEEP titration have been proposed, there is no accepted strategy for titrating optimal PEEP. By analyzing intratidal compliance profiles, PEEP may be individually titrated for patients. METHODS After obtaining informed consent, 60 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly allocated to mechanical ventilation with PEEP 5 cmH2O (control group) or PEEP individually titrated, guided by an analysis of the intratidal compliance profile (intervention group). The primary endpoint was the frequency of each nonlinear intratidal compliance (CRS) profile of the respiratory system (horizontal, increasing, decreasing, and mixed). The secondary endpoints measured were respiratory mechanics, hemodynamic variables, and regional ventilation, which was assessed via electrical impedance tomography. RESULTS The frequencies of the CRS profiles were comparable between the groups. Besides PEEP [control: 5.0 (0.0), intervention: 5.8 (1.1) cmH2O, p \u003C 0.001], the respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the two groups. The compliance profile analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups. The loss of ventral and dorsal regional ventilation was higher in the control [ventral: 41.0 (16.3)%; dorsal: 25.9 (13.8)%] than in the intervention group [ventral: 29.3 (17.6)%; dorsal: 16.4 (12.7)%; p (ventral) = 0.039, p (dorsal) = 0.028]. CONCLUSIONS Unfavorable compliance profiles indicating tidal derecruitment were found less often than in earlier studies. Individualized PEEP titration resulted in slightly higher PEEP. A slight global increase in aeration associated with this was indicated by regional gain and loss analysis. Differences in dorsal to ventral ventilation distribution were not found.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of hypopituitary adult patients followed in a single reference center for pituitary diseases. MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. Patients with 18 years or older, presenting two or more anterior pituitary deficiencies associated or not with diabetes insipidus (DI), were included, while patients with hypopituitarism due to Acromegaly or Cushing\u0027s disease were excluded. RESULTS We studied 99 hypopituitary patients (52 males, mean age 50.1 \u00B1 16.3 years, mean age at diagnosis 33.7 \u00B1 17.6 years) who have been followed for a mean time of 15.9 \u00B1 10.1 years. Hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and non-tumoral etiologies were observed in 53.4% and 46.6% of the cases, respectively. FSH/LH, GH, TSH, ACTH deficiency and DI was present in 99%, 98.6%, 96%, 81.8%, and 23.2%, respectively. The prevalence of MetS was 39.4% and was significantly higher in patients older than 50 years (p = 0.02), overweight/obese (p \u003C 0.001), with hypopituitarism diagnosed in adult life (p = 0.02), who did not replace GH (p = 0.004) and in smokers (p = 0.007). In the logistic regression model, body mass index (BMI) and GH replacement were significantly associated with the presence of MetS. Reduced HDL cholesterol was the most prevalent component of MetS in hypopituitary patients. CONCLUSIONS MetS is a common finding in adult hypopituitary patients, which is mainly influenced by increased BMI and untreated GH deficiency.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent CB ablation in our institution from June 2018. From June 2019, we have been consistently using FoE suture for hemostasis (FoE\u002B group), and before that conventional manual compression was utilized (FoE- group). Ablations were performed under uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy. Both femoral veins were punctured, and a single introducer was placed in each vein. In the FoE- group, after ablation, protamine was administered, and manual compression was applied. In the FoE\u002B group, the suture was placed in both groins without protamine administration and manual compression. All patients were in decubitus position until the next morning. RESULTS A total of 190 consecutive patients (73.2% male, 59.7 \u00B1 11.0 years old) were evaluated, 90 being in the FoE\u002B group. There was no difference in the mean procedure duration between two groups (72.7 \u00B1 23.1 min vs 73.7 \u00B1 27.1 min, p = 0.784). However, the total lab time was significantly longer in FoE- group (132.9 \u00B1 35.3 min vs 109.9 \u00B1 32.6 min, p \u003C 0.0001). There was no difference in complication rates. No major vascular complications were found in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of FoE sutures for hemostasis seems to be a safe and effective after cryoballoon ablation. It abolishes the need for protamine administration which can cause serious adverse events. As manual compression is unrequired, EP lab workflow improves due to significantly shortened total lab time per patient.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Velagic, Vedran; Mugnai, Giacomo; Pasara, Vedran; Prepolec, Ivan; Puljevic, Mislav; Pezo-Nikolic, Borka; Puljevic, Davor; Samardzic, Jure; Cikes, Maja; Milicic, Davor","journal":"Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10840-020-00776-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FoE- group","CB ablation","cryoballoon ablation","conventional manual compression","CONCLUSIONS Utilization of FoE sutures","total lab time","protamine administration","EP lab workflow","hemostasis","consecutive patients","difference","vs","groin access closure","groins","mean procedure duration","groups","male","uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy","impact","serious adverse events","Ablations","decubitus position","feasibility of figure","major vascular complications","single introducer","cohort","years old","morning","complication rates","need","institution","femoral veins","PURPOSE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

These changes are particularly relevant to otolaryngology - head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents, as reports suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 for otolaryngologists. The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23-29, 2020. RESULTS 82 residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department\u0027s COVID-19 response. Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r=0.72, p\u003C0.00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r=-0.52, p \u003C 0.00001). CONCLUSION U.S. OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources of resident anxieties demonstrate the importance of open communication and an integrated team approach to facilitate optimal patient and provider care during this unprecedented crisis.

We have previously reported doxycycline, a nonselective matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibitor, to attenuate aortic root widening and improve aortic contractility and elasticity in MFS mice. We were also first to use multiphoton microscopy, a non-invasive and label-free imaging technique, to quantify and link the aortic ultrastructure to possible changes in the skin dermis. Here, we aimed to assess the effects of long-term doxycycline treatment on the aortic ultrastructure and skin dermis of MFS mice through immunohistochemical evaluation and quantification of elastic and collagen content and morphology using multiphoton microscopy. Our results demonstrate a rescue of aortic elastic fiber fragmentation and disorganization accompanied by a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression within the aortic wall in doxycycline-treated MFS mice. At 12 months of age, reduced skin dermal thickness was observed in both MFS and control mice, but only dermal thinning in MFS mice was rescued by doxycycline treatment. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was reduced in the skin of doxycycline-treated MFS mice. A decrease in dermal thickness was found to be positively associated with increased aortic root elastin disorganization and wall thickness. Our findings confirm the beneficial effects of doxycycline on ultrastructural properties of aortic root as well as on skin elasticity and structural integrity in MFS mice.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tehrani, Arash Y; Cui, Jason Z; Bucky Jones, T; Hotova, Ester; Castro, Monica; Bernatchez, Pascal; van Breemen, Cornelis; Esfandiarei, Mitra","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64071-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346027/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doxycycline-treated MFS mice","aortic ultrastructure","aortic wall","skin of doxycycline","skin dermis of MFS mice","aortic contractility","control mice","ultrastructural properties of aortic root","skin elasticity","reported doxycycline","increased aortic root elastin disorganization","reduced skin dermal thickness","beneficial effects of doxycycline","rescue of aortic elastic fiber fragmentation","effects of long-term doxycycline treatment","wall thickness","dermal thinning","multiphoton microscopy","decrease","expression","results","quantification of elastic","immunohistochemical evaluation","collagen content","nonselective matrix metalloproteinases","inhibitor","MMPs","morphology","connective tissue disorder","possible changes","structural integrity","label-free imaging technique","months of age","findings","aneurysm","Marfan syndrome"],"language":"en"},

When estimating the treatment effect, it is essential to appropriately adjust for selection bias due to observed confounders using, for example, propensity score weighting. Selection bias due to confounders occurs when individuals who are treated are substantially different from those who are untreated with respect to covariates that are also associated with the outcome. A comparison of the unadjusted, naive treatment effect estimate with the propensity score adjusted treatment effect estimate provides an estimate of the selection bias due to these observed confounders. In this article, we propose methods to identify the observed covariate that explains the largest proportion of the estimated selection bias. Identification of the most influential observed covariate or covariates is important in resource-sensitive settings where the number of covariates obtained from individuals needs to be minimized due to cost and/or patient burden and in settings where this covariate can provide actionable information to healthcare agencies, providers, and stakeholders. We propose straightforward parametric and nonparametric procedures to examine the role of observed covariates and quantify the proportion of the observed selection bias explained by each covariate. We demonstrate good finite sample performance of our proposed estimates using a simulation study and use our procedures to identify the most influential covariates that explain the observed selection bias in estimating the causal effect of alcohol use on progression of Huntington\u0027s disease, a rare neurological disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parast, Layla; Griffin, Beth Ann","journal":"Statistics in medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["observed selection bias","observed confounders","treatment effect estimate","influential observed covariate","estimated selection bias","role of observed covariates","influential covariates","naive treatment effect","number of covariates","causal effect of alcohol use","individuals","outcome","propensity score weighting","largest proportion","nonparametric procedures","progression of Huntington\u0027s disease","resource-sensitive settings","rare neurological disease","proposed estimates","healthcare agencies","actionable information","providers","good finite sample performance","target exposure","simulation study","example","patient burden","stakeholders","comparison","observational data","methods","Identification","cost","respect","article"],"language":"en"},

Lipid forms an integral part of many viruses and exists either in the form of a continuous envelope or in lipoprotein complexes that surround a nucleoprotein core or helix.

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and are not known to carry genetic coding for enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. Hence, they generally contain the same classes of lipid as are found in the host cell or their membrane of assembly. Lipids make up 20\u201335% by weight of most viruses; however, there are exceptions such as vaccinia virus, which has only 5% lipid despite having a complex multimembrane envelope structure. Naked herpesvirus capsids closely resemble non-lipid-containing viruses such as adenovirus or polyoma virus, which are also assembled in the nucleus but show full infectivity without any envelope.

The first activity that could be observed is the growth of the epithelial cells. At the site of entry into the body, microorganisms that are shed directly to the exterior multiply in the epithelial surface producing a spreading infection in the epithelium. Certain microorganisms spread through the body to reach susceptible target organs after free microorganism particles have entered vessels below the skin or intestinal epithelium. The infected host has a variety of defenses that operate without delay, before the immune response comes into action. However, many microbes have strategies for interfering with these defenses. After traversing the epithelial cell layer, a microorganism encounters the basement membrane. After reaching the subepithelial tissues they are exposed to three important host defense systems: the tissue fluids, the lymphatic system leading to the lymph nodes, and phagocytic cells. In addition to being able to resist host defense mechanisms, a pathogenic organism\u2014be it an obligate intracellular, facultative intracellular, or extracellular pathogen\u2014must also overcome the problem of obtaining essential nutrients if it is to be successful.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John","journal":"Mims\u0027 Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6650137a2395361cc14bd71e51a4014f770e8780.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell","infected host","epithelial cells","host defense mechanisms","important host defense systems","body","epithelial surface","epithelial cell layer","pathogenic organism","variety of defenses","intestinal epithelium","phagocytic cells","site of entry","Certain microorganisms","free microorganism particles","tissue fluids","vessels","susceptible target organs","lymphatic system","lymph nodes","delay","skin","extracellular pathogen","spreading infection","immune response","problem","responses","strategies","interfering","essential nutrients","basement membrane","chapter","events","action","microbes","exterior","addition","growth","subepithelial tissues","activity"],"language":"en"},

Antibody, T cells, natural killer cells, complement, phagocytes, and interferon are involved in the response to nearly all infections and, without any doubt, are together responsible for recovery. There is good evidence that T-cell-mediated immunity is of supreme importance in recovery from a variety of microbial infections. These are the infections in which the microorganism replicates intracellularly. Tissue responses in the host bear the hallmarks of T-cell involvement, the infiltrating cells consisting primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages. Inflammation, whether induced by immunological reactions, tissue damage or microbial products, plays a vital role in recovery from infection. Inflammation is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune defenses because it focuses all circulating antimicrobial factors onto the site of infection. Complement can carry out antimicrobial activities. However, there is little direct evidence that the antimicrobial activities of complement are in fact important in the body. Interferons also act on uninfected cells, binding to a cell surface receptor and activating a number of genes involved in immunity to viruses. Multimechanistic recovery is illustrated in the chapter and other issues, such as the role of temperature, tissue repair, and resistance to re-infection are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John","journal":"Mims\u0027 Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5bea24cf81e54b132b3c920c172829f54c92f02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","recovery of host","T-cell","Multimechanistic recovery","antimicrobial activities of complement","infiltrating cells","uninfected cells","antimicrobial factors","variety of microbial infections","cell involvement","natural killer cells","hallmarks of T","tissue repair","tissue damage","Tissue responses","immunological factors","re-infection","site of infection","Inflammation","chapter","cell surface receptor","microbial products","mediated immunity","vital role","immunological reactions","role of temperature","good evidence","little direct evidence","supreme importance","proper functioning","resistance","binding","number of genes","fact important","phagocytes","Antibody","immune defenses","lymphocytes","doubt","viruses","microorganism replicates","macrophages","Interferons","issues"],"language":"en"},

It belongs to the picornavirus family of nonenveloped positive-strand RNA viruses. The RNA synthesis of rhinovirus is carried out by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, also known as 3D(Pol). It catalyzes the synthesis of negative-strand RNA using a positive-strand template. The structure of the enzyme consists of three domains: palm, fingers, and thumb domains and Mg(2\u002B) in the active site. These conserved structural features of the enzyme help in catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation between the two consecutive nucleotide units complimentary to the template RNA using a VPg primer. Owing to the presence of over 100 serotypes of the enzyme, designing specific inhibitors targeting the polymerase is a challenging task and until now no clinically approved antirhino viral drug is reported.

In such a small area, Taiwan has built 22 incinerators over a short span of time, combusting large amount of municipal solid waste as much as 23,250 tons per day. This study focuses on the history of construction and development of incinerators in Taiwan as well as the characteristics of pollutants, such as heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg), acid gases (NO(x), SO(x), CO, and HCl), and dioxins emitted from the incinerators. Furthermore, the study also covers the generation and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW), and the production of energy in Taiwan. According to Taiwan\u2019s data on pollutant emissions, the emission level of pollutants is under control and meets the stringent regulations of Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Researches have shown that using air pollution control devices (APCDs) in the operation of incinerators provides effective measures for air pollutant control in Taiwan. The main advantage of using incinerators is the generation of electricity (waste-to-energy) during the incineration of municipal solid waste, producing energy that can be consumed by the general public and the industry. Taiwan\u2019s extensive experience in incinerator construction and operation may serve as an example for developing countries in devising waste treatment technology, energy recovery, and the control of contagious viral diseases.","publish_time":"2008-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Jia-Hong; Tseng, Hui-Hsin; Rao, P.

Basically, a system consists of a number of parts that are connected to each other. Systems differ depending on the nature of their connectedness. Simple systems have one-to-one relationships and their behaviour is precisely predictable. Complicated systems have one-to-many relationships with mostly predictable behaviours. This book deals with complex adaptive systems with many-to-many relationships. Their many-to-many relationships make their behaviour emergent, hence their outcomes are unpredictable. Complex adaptive systems have a special characteristic, the members of the system can learn from feedback and experiences. The relationships in complex adaptive systems change constantly allowing the system to evolve over time in light of changing demands. However, a system\u2019s overall behaviour, despite its adaptation to changing circumstances, remains relatively stable within boundaries, but occasionally, its behaviour may change abruptly and dramatically for no apparent reason. Another important characteristic of complex adaptive systems is its nonlinear behaviour to change, i.e. the magnitude of change in one member of the system shows a disproportional change in that of others. As experience shows, small changes in the behaviour of a system member often show dramatic changes in the behaviour of the whole system, whereas a major change in the behaviour of that member typically results in little or no change. Studying complex adaptive systems aims to understand the relationships and the dynamics between the members of the systems.

Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dattilo, Wesley; Silva, Alcides Castro e; Guevara, Roger; MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Ribeiro, Servio Pontes","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ae569f06a6675f7f362c2a3a43785618738d3ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["assessed public health infrastructure","public health actors","Mexican cities","cause of COVID","social distancing scenarios","infection rates of COVID","focal cities","important cities","SARS-CoV","Mexican air transportation network","spread of SARS","current pandemic","timely implement health policies","modeled scenario","wide array of epidemiological models","explicit model","vulnerability of population centers","growth of infection rate","new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","rapid dissemination","decision-makers","total number of infected people","understanding","impact","results","drop-off","useful information","broad scale","human mobility","Mexico","disease","sufficiency","alarming findings","study","usefulness","days"],"language":"en"},

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen\u0027s kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%). Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malosh, Ryan E; Petrie, Joshua G; Callear, Amy P; Monto, Arnold S; Martin, Emily Toth","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0f7d2f94eba1f19a1ea6731f49d31bccad27393.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of influenza","influenza types","influenza B lineages","respiratory specimens","Community based studies of influenza","identification of influenza virus infections","Collection of nasal swab specimens","specificity of home","Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation","throat swab specimens","utility of home","reliability of home","research staff","collection methods","H1N1","paired staff","alternative data collection","respiratory viruses","high agreement","H3N2 infections","community-based cohort study","onset of acute respiratory illness","study clinic","moderate agreement","days of onset","symptom onset","Cohort participants","Yamagata","Victoria","calculated sensitivity","social distancing guidelines","order","pandemic","multi-year","ideal setting","Cohen\u0027s kappa","HIVE","nose","RT-PCR","SARS-COV","low-contact","Background","Conclusions","current COVID","feasibility","resource intensive","range","laboratory confirmation of infection","Results","subtypes"],"language":"en"},

For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators. Author summary The threat posed by infectious diseases has a huge impact on our global society. It is therefore critical to monitor infectious diseases as new data become available during control campaigns. One obstacle in observing disease emergence or elimination is understanding what influences noise in the data and how this fluctuates when near to zero cases. The standard data type collected is the number of new cases per day/month/year but mathematical modellers often focus on data such as the total number of infectious people, due to its analytical properties. We have developed a methodology to monitor the standard type of data to inform whether a disease is approaching emergence or disease elimination. We have shown computationally how fluctuations change as disease data get closer towards a tipping point and our insights highlight how these observed changes can be strikingly different when calculated on different types of data.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Southall, Emma; Tildesley, Michael J.; Dyson, Louise","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dae510987d1be3e60f2a773f95c8f35e3f66ff15.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.021576","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EWS","CDC","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease data","incidence data","prevalence data","real-world data","disease elimination","standard data type","standard type of data","Disease Control","different types of data","promising new data type","disease emergence","infectious disease transitions","simulated studies of disease incidence","simulated incidence time series data exhibit","rate of incidence","infectious diseases","potential EWS","critical transition","unreliable indicators of elimination","number of new cases","total number of infectious people","different behaviours","control campaigns","control policies","variance","theory","promising potential","analytical properties","observed changes","epidemiological systems","sudden change","analytical predictions","application of statistical indicators","month","day","CDC","Prevention","Centers","year","huge impact","decreasing trend","approach","mathematical modellers","tipping point","insights","autocorrelation","threat","World Health Organization","Early warning signals","Author summary","influences noise","global society","inexpensive method","state","fluctuations","obstacle","work","examples","methodology","property"],"language":"en"},

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), a low prevalence area. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was tested using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10.90% and 10.85% in influent water and 3.29% and 6.19% in effluent water samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater waters of 5.29 log genomic copies/L on average. Moreover, we tested as negative all secondary and tertiary treated water samples, highlighting that current water disinfection treatments applied in the analyzed WWTP are able to remove SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating among the population even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randazzo, W.; Truchado, P.; Ferrando, E.

As residents rely upon operative exposure and in-person didactic lectures for education, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have forced programs to revise how they educate residents. Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. Results Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education. Most commonly programs are using faculty- (91%) or resident-led (65%) lectures, though nearly 75% are supplementing resident education with materials from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). Continuing education in spite of decreased case volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. Conclusion Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency programs to the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs are increasingly incorporating teleconferencing platforms and third-party education materials, most commonly materials from the CNS. Additionally, most respondents indicated that their program has not redeployed residents in the care of COVID-19 positive patients. The results of the present study may assist program directors in developing a uniform resident curriculum and consider wellness initiatives during this time of crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pennington, Zach; Lubelski, Daniel; Khalafallah, Adham; Ehresman, Jeff; Sciubba, Daniel M.; Witham, Timothy F.; Huang, Judy","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d76b694f52b83f56fbce3d92230a0142b4fbdc63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020311104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020311104?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resident education","resident staffing","resident morale","resident experiences","resident wellness initiatives","uniform resident curriculum","resident work weeks","program PDs","pandemic","Continuing education","redeployed residents","third-party education materials","hospital resident shift census","care of COVID","program directors","responses of neurosurgical residency programs","common concerns of PDs","clinical care responsibilities of residents","ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs","CNS","Results","person didactic lectures","Survey questions targeted changes","teleconferencing platforms","teleconferencing solutions","PD concerns","didactic material delivery","large proportion of neurosurgical cases","coverage","accordant radical change","spite of decreased case volume","Congress of Neurological Surgeons","operative exposure","postponement","present study","meetings","disruptions","great homogeneity","time of crisis","positive patients","Abstract Background","Methods Surveys","respondents","faculty","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We use an untargeted high-throughput approach which combines immunoglobulin disease-specific epitope-enrichment and identification of microbial and human antigens. Increased microbial diversity was observed in dermatomyositis. Viruses were over-represented and species of the Poxviridae family were significantly enriched. The autoantibodies identified recognised a large portion of the human proteome, including interferon regulated proteins; these proteins were clustered in specific biological processes. Apart from TRIM33, autoantibodies against eleven further TRIM proteins, including TRIM21, were identified. Some of these TRIM proteins shared epitope homology with specific viral species including poxviruses. Our data suggest antibody accumulation in dermatomyositis against an expanded diversity of microbial and human proteins and evidence of non-random targeting of specific signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that molecular mimicry and epitope spreading events may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Megremis, Spyridon; Walker, Thomas D.
